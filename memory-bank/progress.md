# Progress: Astrologia API

## What Works

- Initial project documentation has been reviewed and processed.
- The core architecture and data flow are understood based on the provided diagrams and documents.
- The basic FastAPI application structure has been set up.
- Pydantic models for request and response validation have been created.
- API routers for the following endpoints have been implemented:
  - Natal Chart calculation
  - Current Transits calculation
  - Transits to Natal Chart calculation
- Integration with the Kerykeion library for astrological calculations has been established.
- Translation utilities for supporting Portuguese language in responses have been implemented.
- Interpretation services for providing textual analysis of astrological elements have been created.
- SVG chart generation capabilities have been added.
- House system customization has been implemented.
- The structure and key components of both the original implementation (in `app/`) and the V3 implementation have been identified.
- The original implementation has been moved to `app/v1/` and the V3 implementation has been moved to `app/`.
- The project has been initialized in Taskmaster and the tasks have been generated by parsing the prd.txt file.

## What's Left to Build

- Complete the integration of house system customization across all endpoints.
- Enhance the translation system to ensure all astrological terms are properly translated.
- Expand the interpretation service with more detailed interpretations.
- Improve the SVG chart generation with more customization options.
- Implement API key authentication middleware or dependency.
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all components.
- Update the API documentation to reflect all implemented features.
- Optimize performance for large-scale usage.
- Analyze the differences between the original implementation and the V3 implementation and integrate the V3 features into the original implementation.
- Implement the RAG system for generating interpretations based on the provided books, or a simpler text search approach if resources are limited.
- Work on the tasks generated by Taskmaster.

## Current Status

The project has progressed from the initial planning phase to active implementation. The core functionality is in place, and advanced features are being developed. The API can now calculate natal charts, transits, and provide interpretations, with support for multiple languages and house systems. The V3 implementation provides a more modular and feature-rich foundation for future development. The original implementation has been moved to `app/v1/` and the V3 implementation is now in `app/`. The Taskmaster project has been initialized and the tasks have been generated.

## Known Issues

- Handling historical dates and timezones accurately with Kerykeion remains a challenge.
- The calculation of aspects between transit and natal charts using Kerykeion's `SynastryAspects` class may need refinement.
- SVG generation may have performance implications for high-traffic scenarios.
- The interpretation system currently provides basic interpretations and needs expansion for more detailed analysis.
- The RAG system for generating interpretations based on the provided books is not yet implemented due to resource limitations.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use FastAPI over Flask has proven beneficial for performance and auto-documentation.
- The reliance on Kerykeion has been validated, though some adaptation has been necessary for the API context.
- The addition of translation and interpretation layers has enhanced the API's value proposition.
- Supporting multiple house systems has increased flexibility but added complexity.
- The decision to preserve original English terms alongside translations ensures compatibility with existing systems.
- Taskmaster AI is now being used for project management.
