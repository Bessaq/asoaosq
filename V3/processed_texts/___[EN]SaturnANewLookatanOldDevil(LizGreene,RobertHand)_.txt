S “Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind
of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction,
and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to
all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience
of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater
consciousness and fulfillment.”
— from the book Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and
synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of
the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater
consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom. 6
“Liz Greene’s Saturn is one of the key works in the most important
single contribution of twentieth-century astrology to the development
of astrology: the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed
destiny but is a potential map of the unfolding of the
authentic, higher self.”

Many years after its initial publication it is difficult to overestimate the importance of Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old
Devil and what it represents. It was and is an important step in the
progress of the twentieth century’s most crucial contribution to the
evolution of astrology—namely, the use of astrology as a tool of selfrealization and self-actualization.
Traditional forms of astrology derived from the Middle
Eastern traditions--which include Hellenistic, Jyotish, and Medieval
Astrology (both in Arabic and Latin)--seem to have assumed that
the basic events and circumstances of one’s life were predetermined
to a significant degree, if not completely. Those Hellenistic astrologers strongly influenced by Stoicism show this tendency at its most
extreme. The following passage from Manilius demonstrates this:
The fates rule the world, everything stands settled by law.
Long seasons are marked out by causes which are fixed.
As we are born, we are dying, and the end depends
upon the beginning.
From this both wealth and kingship flow, and, more
often there arises poverty. Skills and character are
granted to those thus created, also vice, praise, the
losses and the gathering of things.
—[Manilius, Astronomica Book IV, lines 14-19. My translation] Islamic and Christian astrologers of the middle ages gave
greater scope to free will in theory, but in practice this is not obvious. Also, all three traditional forms of astrology held that there were
“good” and “bad” planets, which later came to be called benefics and 45173

PM Saturn Júpiter malefics, one of which was Saturn. Benefics “caused” good destinies,
malefics evil ones.
However, even in the ancient world, there were voices which
dissented from both of these ideas--that everything was determined
at the moment of birth and that there were “good” and “bad” planets--a concept which Saturn does much to undermine. The philosopher Plotinus (AD 204/5 –270) rejected both ideas in Enneads. His
description of how the planets act could have been written by a modern astrologer:
We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being
inscribed on the heavens or inscribed once for all and
yet moving as they pursue the other tasks allotted to
them: upon these main tasks will follow the quality of
signifying. . .
—Enneads 2.3.7, McKenna translation He rejects the idea of good and bad planets in the following
two passages:
The belief is that the planets in their courses actually
produce not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth,
health, and sickness, but even ugliness and beauty and,
gravest of all, vices and virtue and the very acts that
spring from these qualities, the definite doings of each
moment of virtue or vice. We are to suppose the stars
to be annoyed with men—and upon matters in which
men, molded to what they are by the stars themselves,
can surely do them no wrong.
—Enneads 2.3.1, McKenna translation [The planets are]. . . continuously serene, happy in the
good they enjoy and the vision before them. Each lives
its own free life; each finds its own Good in its own
Act; and this Act is not directed towards us.

5/ Mercúrio /2011 10:50:36 PM Foreword 5 Other Platonists followed Plotinus in this respect, but this
had little impact on practical astrology. However, these passages serve
to tell us that even in ancient times the “traditional” view of astrology
was rejected by some, firmly, on philosophical grounds.
Despite the above exceptions among the ancients and a few medieval philosophers who voiced similar objections, deterministic views and
the idea of benefic and malefic planets dominated astrology until the
twentieth century. It was the twentieth century and the astrology of the
modern West which saw the overthrow of these two positions.
Before Liz Greene’s work, others had taken steps--indeed large
steps--in this direction, most notably the late Dane Rudhyar (1895 1985) and some of his followers. Even as far back as the work of Alan
Leo (1860 - 1917) at the turn of the last century, one could see movement in this direction. But in the case of Leo, this trend was enveloped
in a heavy layer of Theosophy, and it could be argued that self-actualization in Leo’s work was much more directly part of his Theosophy and
only incidentally part of his astrology. One had to more or less adopt
his theosophical beliefs and practices in order to use astrology for selfactualization. His Esoteric Astrology, much like the later work of the
same name by Alice Bailey, considerably changed and even distorted the
ancient symbolism of astrology in order to achieve its result, rather than
building on that symbolism and extending it to a new purpose.
Dane Rudyhar, who was a student of Bailey’s, took the next
step and used the true and authentic ancient symbolism of astrology as
it was to describe astrology as a tool of self-actualization. Works such
as his Astrology of Personalitycombined Bailey’s insights, along with
others gained from the psychology of Freud and Jung, to make it clear
that astrology could move from its medieval heritage of predicting
events and the external circumstances of life to reveal an understanding of the inner processes of the soul. Rudyhar explored how these
influenced the individual’s life and, more importantly, how an understanding of these could give one freedom and self-determination; he
also roundly attacked the idea of benefic and malefic planets.
I do not mean to take away from Rudhyar’s value as an author
and the importance of his work in what I am about to say. His work
was written in language that was often obscure, abstract and very theoretical. His material gave one hope that it was possible to transcend
any particular astrological manifestation, but it did not offer any concrete ways to do this. It was for the next generation of astrologers to 45173

5/ Mercúrio /2011 10:50:36 PM Saturn 6 begin to accomplish this task. Liz Greene’s Saturn was an important
contribution to this work.
The format of the book is actually rather traditional.
Superficially it appears to be a conventional handbook of delineations. It takes up Saturn’s influence in the signs and houses, and in
aspect to the other planets. I can say without taking away from Liz
Greene’s accomplishment in this work that this was not an original
arrangement; many handbooks of astrological delineations before did
the same thing. But this more or less conventional way of organizing the material was exactly what was needed to fill the gap between
Rudhyar’s powerful but abstract descriptions and the needs of a seeker
trying to find out what to do with his or her natal chart.
However, I must raise a bit of a quibble here, regarding the
practice of equating the symbolism of planets in the houses with the
symbolism of planets in the corresponding signs. For example, following this belief, , Saturn in Aries acts like Saturn in the first house,
Saturn in Taurus acts like Saturn in the second house, and so forth.
Older, pre-modern astrology may be philosophically and spiritually
limited, but its symbolic vocabulary is huge and rich. This equating
of sign and house positions was never done except in melothesia, the
assignment of signs and houses to parts of the body (Aries and first
related to the head, Taurus and second relate to the throat, etc.) Signs
and houses are very different kinds of symbolic entities, having very
different functions. To equate them in this manner, I believe, is to confuse two very different symbol systems.
But even given my objection, I do not believe this is a great flaw
in Saturn because Liz Greene’s emphasis here is clearly on the house
placement over the sign placement and for this purpose the delineations are masterful. The references to sign placement, even if signs and
houses could be equated, would have to be of less value for the simple
reason that Saturn spends two and a half years in a sign, and about two
hours each day in a house. The house placements of a planet are much
more characteristic of the individual person while the sign placements
describe all persons born over an extended period of time.
The nature of the book’s descriptions of the combinations of
Saturn with signs, houses, and other planets set it apart from the “cookbook” approach of previous works. It is not that Greene’s descriptions
are more “accurate” (as if one could make a precise forecast of exactly
how a planet will manifest in each setting). It is a matter of providing 45173

5/ Mercúrio /2011 10:50:36 PM Foreword 7 descriptions which enlarge the capacity of the individual to take control of his or her life. Instead of fully developed prescriptions for what
will happen, the reader is presented with a range of arguments derived
from the combination of symbols and then shown how changes in
consciousness and self-awareness can completely turn life manifestations around, turning those that are potentially difficult more creative
and fulfilling. Her descriptions are not mere “optimistic” descriptions
of possibilities that ignore the downside, but are instead descriptions
of the work that an individual needs to do in order to make creative
changes. Greene does not avoid describing the realizations that must
occur and tasks to be undertaken. It all requires a change in consciousness and increased self-awareness. Here is an example from her
description of Saturn in the sixth house:
When a man is relatively unconscious, Saturn [in the
sixth] may be symbolic of discontent and resentment
because he may be aware only of the fact that he is in a
rut and that he is imprisoned by circumstances. . . .Yet
the meaning of the routine escapes him because he does
not truly understand the meaning of service. . . It is
said in esoteric teaching that service, rather than being
“good works”, is an innate quality of the inner man . . .
Service of this kind is the result of inner integration for
once the body and feelings and mind of a man are in
balance, he can then begin to become aware, intuitively,
of the purpose and nature of his inner psyche. . . Service
which is the result of inner balance is the potential
result of Saturn in the sixth house when he is expressing
in a conscious way.
—[page 44 in the 1976 edition] As mentioned previously, even in medieval astrology it was
recognized that free will can alter an astrological indication. But this
belief was largely for religious reasons. If one did not have freedom of
will, then the freedom to choose salvation could not exist. It would
have made God, not the individual responsible for the individual’s
success or failure in achieving salvation through the planets. . But
while medieval astrologers paid lip service to this idea, it did not lead 45173

5/ Mercúrio /2011 10:50:36 PM Saturn 8 them to show how astrological influences could be modified by an act
of will. It is not even very clear that they believed it could be done.
Saturn led the way in one of the triumphs of modern astrology
in showing that a combination of acceptance, understanding, and the
ability to perceive alternative choiceswith increased awareness is the
variable that can change the way in which one experiences one’s chart
and one’s life. And here is an important point! I firmly believe, and
I believe that this book points to this, that the level of consciousness
with which one approaches one’s own life is not fixed or determined by
whatever the birth chart signifies. One’s potential level of self-awareness is not fated! It may be very difficult to change one’s consciousness
as circumstances—family, friends, one’s cultural background— may
seem to work against it at times, but it is always possible.
The choice of Saturn as the subject of this book was superb. Liz
Greene has subsequently written several other similar works on other
planets. But Saturn was the best place to begin precisely because Saturn
is the planet that has most seemed to restrict freedom and fix destiny to
astrologers. Many astrologers have seen Saturn as the planet of “karma”
in the false but common sense of the word often used in the West, i.e.,
as the distributer of an inevitable fate handed out as punishment or
reward for deeds done in the pastor in previous lifetimes.
That even Saturn’s energy can be altered by the proper degree
of wisdom and understanding opens up a way of seeing all of astrology
in the same light. It is not necessary for one to go on an extreme spiritual path, to abandon one’s life in the world and take up the begging
bowl to achieve this. Greene shows in countless examples how smaller
“enlightenments” are available to us all if we approach things with the
proper understanding. In traditional astrology Saturn was called the
“greater malefic” (Mars being the “lesser”). Being the worse of the two
traditional “malefics,” Saturn, makes it clear that this could be done
with all of the symbols of the chart.
In this way Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil
has become one of the key works in this most important contribution
of twentieth century astrology to the development of astrology and
the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed destiny, but a potential map of the unfolding of the authentic, higher self.

PM S “Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind
of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction,
and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to
all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience
of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater
consciousness and fulfillment.”
— from the book Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and
synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of
the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater
consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom. 6
“Liz Greene’s Saturn is one of the key works in the most important
single contribution of twentieth-century astrology to the development
of astrology: the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed
destiny but is a potential map of the unfolding of the
authentic, higher self.”

fairytale. Here, noted astrologer Liz Greene takes a major step in
the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who
have interpreted Saturn as a ‘malefic’ planet and, in so doing, presents a
remarkably rich study of the unconscious mind, shedding light on that
mysterious, elusive entity that psychology calls the self. Greene Meet Saturn’s Other Face SATURN
