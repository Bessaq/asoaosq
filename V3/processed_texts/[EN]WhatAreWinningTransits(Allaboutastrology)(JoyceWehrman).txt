All About Astrology WI{AT ARE WINNING
By Joyce Wehrman $3.00 ({r Whar Are winnine Transits? INTRODUCTION
Everyonecan win at some time in their lives.Very few people
havethe natal potential to becomea professionalgambler.From
my experience,most people have dreams of doing just that.
Dreams do not always match reality. In all practicality,if you
chooseto do your speculationat the most propitioustime - then
you can win!! If you rely on the fates,or lady luck, or whatever,
you will have more losing times than winning times. With the
assistanceof the Winning Transitsprogram you can time your
days,hours and minutesof speculation.Remember,if something
hashappenedbefore,under similar transitsand/or similar house
cusp contacts- the odds are that it will happen again.
One of the most important issuesis what to activatein the
natal chart. I would refer you to Winning!! Zodiacal Timing (my
book on the subject - currently out of print) for more complete
information on using astrologicaltiming to speculate.Basically,
it is a matter of activating your personalgambling placements.
For eachand everyperson,theseplacementsare uniquely his or
her own. Astro Computing'sWinning Thnsits programcalculates
all of this for you.
The Winning Transitsare computed to saveyou hours of
hand calculations.They are timed for the location at which you
chooseto gamble or speculate.So, it naturally follows that the
exactlongitudeand latitude of that location are a must. 'About"
will not work! Pleaserememberto alwaysinclude the location
at which you intend to gamble or speculatewith any order of
Winning Transits.
must assumethat the natal
The Winning Tiansitsby necessity
birth data is gnat eyelashcorrect. If you have not done enough
experimentationwith your horoscopeto be at least llUVo certain
of this fact, then you must expect to spend some time in
rectification of your birth time. I will expandon how to do this
rectification further into the article. FORMAT OF THE REPORT
Looking at a pageof Winning Transits,the first line shows
the natal birth data. I would suggestalwayscheckingthis to be
certain that it is correct. The secondline givesthe data for the
day of speculationthat is in question:day and dateofspeculation;
place, including latitude and longitude; and time zone. (From
the last Sundayin April until the last Sundayin October, most
statesin the United Statesutilize daylight savingstime. Your
Winning Tiansits from Astro Computing Serviceswill reflect
this.)
Pleasenote that Astro requiresthe following information:
completenatal birth data, place of intendedspeculation(name,
not coordinates
as Astro will figurethe time zone)and the dates
on which you wish to speculate(day, month and year). Again,
double-checkthis data to be surethat you havesentin the correct
information. (Our illustration condensestwo lines into six due
to spacerestrictions.)

the Winning Tiansits program, this

becomes most easy, for you will not

an aspect. CHOOSING DAYS
Before deciding on a particular d,ayor days that you wish
to gamble, I would highly suggestthat well in advance,you obtain
the Transit Calendar (seepage 3) or Winning Overview(seepage Júpiter ) from Astro Computing Services..
The Tiansit Calendar allows you to personallydiscernwhich
will be the best of all times to gamble and win. The Winning Overview allows you to choose favorable times based on the
Winning system, without doing all the tedious calculations
yourself. With both reports,you will not overlook a transit that
otherwiseyou might missin simply checkingthe ephemeris.Quite
naturally, the most overlookedaspectis the Quincunx and the
most overlooked transiting planet is Neptune.
In using the Transit Calendar,you are looking for transits
activating the speculativeareasof your natal chart. Deciding what
should be activateddependson the individual natal chart. The
speculativehousesare 2, 5, 8 and Mercúrio - and sometimesll and
6. Readthe intrinsicmeaningof the planetin the houseand ruling
the cusp. The Part of Fortune works. The Nodes work. Saturn
will, if it is a gambling planet for you (in or ruling a speculative
house).Jupiter will not work unlessit is a gamblingplanet. If
a gamblingplanetis in a retrogradestation(two degreesapplying orb), put out a yellow flag: caution. Remember,the planet is what;
the sign is how; the houseis where.Considerthe aspectsformed
by planets in speculationhouses:the kind of aspectand what
is making the aspects.
Tiines and sextilesare ease.Tiines point to fun times, but
not much profit.'Sextiles are forgettable where speculationis
concerned.Conjunctions, squaresand oppositionsare activity.
Quincunx is renunciation or alternatives- rarely good for
gambling. Semi-squareis stress,but can be usedwith the proper
perspective.Semi-squareis not enough by itself; look to other
factors as well. Sesqui-squareis trouble. The parallel and
contraparallelshow increasedawareness,inside.By themselves,
they are insufficient. You need other zodiacal aspectsas well.
Activating orbs are 15 minutes applying, I minute separating.
Consistently,the closer, the better on orbs! I,IA V 1 Mercúrio 8 5 Plutão E R S ONAL TRANSIT CALENDAR FOR ASTRO C OM PU T IN G SER VIC ES 3 2S 1973 L3hZ En Os EST 4l N

Vd4s 2l :O0+ ) aP 23 :2 I A WORD ON TRANSPLUTO
If you are not familiar with the symbol for Tianspluto, it
is O. Over the years,I havefound that it is imperativeto usethe
natal and transiting position of Tianspluto. I refer you to John
Hawkins' book Tianspluto Or Should WeCall Him BACCHUS
the Ruler of Thurus?ln 1972I was urgedto useTianspluto,but
being reluctantto admit that somethingthat I wasnot using could
be important, I did not do so. In 1976,I beganusingTianspluto.
After years of working with it, I must urge you to also use
Tianspluto!! I have found that the aspectsand position of
Tiansplutooften haveto do with major wins and winning times.
Always keepingthe thought in mind - to keepany astrological
systemas simpleas possible- I only add to a basicastrological
chart that which adds information that cannot be found in anv Bfrtti'^t. AT END: neP Plutão ey DQO9bd D^rrV aP 318 other manner.Thus after researchingthe use of Tianspluto for
two years,in everyimaginablechart and the subsequentuse of
Tianspluto in all horoscopesover the years, I came to the
conclusionthat it must be used.Tiansitsto the natalTianspluto
are very revealing.Daily transits betweenthe other planetsand
Tianspluto are mandatory for understandingcertain eventsthat
transpire in the world scene. THE QUESTION OF WHICH
HOUSE SYSTEM TO USE
The HouseSystemis Koch. In all the yearssince1972,lhave
yet to seea chart of an exact time where someonewon a large
amount that could not easily be explainedby using the Koch
house system.Use only the Koch house system! ffi
- ABSOLUTE #I ('
f it finishes.However,for casino wageringthe situation is totally
different, becauseyou can chooseyour time to play.Thus, playing
can becomeWinning for greatersuccessbecauseyou are in the
position to selectthe moments that you play.
In the game of Craps, this can sometimesbe a problem,
becauseif you are at a full table, by the time the dice reachyou,
you may or may not be "On the Wheel." The only way to make
certainthat you can roll the dice at the time you want, is to begin
at an empty table, and that is not always possible.
"On the Wheel,"again,meansthat the transitinghousecusps
are contacting your natal horoscopewithin the orbs used in
Winning. Figuring transiting house cusps without a computer
is extremelyboring and time consuming. The Winning Tiransitsenableyou to know the exacttime that
you are "On the Wheel," without all the tedioushand calculations
that would otherwisebe necessary.
"On the Wheel" is a term that
I have used throughout Winning!! Zodiacal Timing to indicate
times that the transiting house cuspsare contacting the natal
horoscope.When the transiting housecuspsare in aspectwith
the natal chart, this ties you into the eventsof that particular
time. This is first and foremost what is neededin order to win.
You must be "On the Wheel" in order to win.
Looking again at your Winning printout, the bulk of each
page has about eight columns on it. These occur just under a
statementabout TIMES "ON THE WHEEL' and the list of your
activefactors(for gambling)in the natal chart. The columns are
structured for each minute of the 24-hour day.
'
It is in 24-how clock motion. Thus l:00 PM is 13:00,etc.
You will seevariousplus and minus periods,as well as somethat
are blank. The blank time periodsare thosethat havenot proven
to be a plus for gambling.Now someof thosetime periodswill
work for some people. The way to find out is to try it and see.
Tiy cautiously or it could be an expensive way to learn.
Occasionally,you may find that a time that shouldbe a plus time
is not. That is becauseof the natal aspectsof that position,or
the natal mipoint structureof that position.Nevergamblewith
th e tr ans it ing m idp o i n t o f M a rs , S a tu rn , o r N eptune
combinationsactivatinganythingin the chart (two minute orb).
The other possibilityis that the transitingposition of a particular
planet is "carrying" with it, difficult transiting aspectsor a
difficult midpoint structure.
At the horse or dog races,you are not in direct control of
timing, but are at the mercyof when the raceis begunand when ABSOLUTE #2
For greatergain you must havea transitingplanetactivating
your money and/or gambling placementsin your natal chart.
Notice on your printout, just abovethe major eight columns,is
a phrase, 'Active factors in natal," followed by a colon and a
list of planets,other factors(e. Vênus .,nodes)and housecusps.Those
factors listed are your personal gambling placements(in your
natal chart).This information (activefactorsin natal)is alsolisted
in the Winning Overviewreport. (SeeWinning!! hdiacal Timing
for more information on how to determine your gambling
placementsand what will activatethem.) You can win with only
Absolute #1. howeverit is usuallv a very small amount. SUMMARY
You are looking for times that are plus both in the far left

TIMING INFORMATION ON
CASINO GAMBLING
Some conclusionsI have to offer on the subiect of Casino
Wagering are:
l. It is important to leave home on a chart that shows
returning with more money than you had when you left.
I-eavinghome meanswhen you walk out the door. You
should also leavehome on a plus time for your home base.
(This meansobtaining Winning Transitsfor your place
of residence,and walking out the door on a minute which
is a plus time in your Winning printout.) Remember,you
want times that are plus in both "Tiansits Activating
Natal" and in "Times 'On the Wheel.' "
2. Each time you leaveyour hotel or place of residencewhile
in one of the gambling centers(your home away from
home), you establish a new wagering chart. As in all
charts, each has a "birth" and a "death." In that chart,
it is shown how much time you have to wager and win.
When the gambling becomes"cold," you must go back
to your residenceaway from home. Take a break, and
begin once more. If calculatingthis timing seemsto be
too much, then just remember:when the tablesgo cold,
your
go
room,
take
back
to
a
break
and
then
begin
anew.
3. You must leaveto gamble on a plus time. (Check your
Winning printout beforeyou walk out the door.) This is
true for every time you depart to go gambling. Júpiter . You must enter the particular casino on a plus time. If
you enter a casino on a minus time, then nothing will
go right for you. For instance,you might not be able to
get a seatat the particular table that you wantedto play
at; the crap table that seemsto be "hot" will be full; a
dealerthat you would prefer not to play with replacesone
that you like; there is no spaceat the visible slots; etc.
5. You must begin playrngon a plus time. If any of the above
are done on a minus time, it is quite simple: you lose!
This finally explains why one casino will be good for a
period, and then go cold. In another casino,you can do nothing
while there,eventhough you still havethe bestactivatingtransits
possible.Then, you changecasinosand the next one is a place
whereyou can only win. Rather than eachtime returningto your
"home away from home," sometimesone can simply change
casinos.Ifthat doesnot work, go backto that "home base"and
begin once more.
One of the worst conceptsis to stay at the same casino,
regardlessof what is happening:win, lose, draw. Remember,it
is no sin to change casinos, either after a major win or a
disappointingexperience.Casinoslove having peoplestay with
them, hour after hour, becauseit increasesthe potential loss.
Everyonehas at one time or another remarked that they
cannot stand a certain casino and absolutelylove another one.
If we had accessto all the casinos'natal horoscopes,you would soon see why this is true. Unfortunately, we do not have this
information, so we are left following our feelings. If you are a
person who is totally tuned in to your inner feelings,then you
will simply know which is the right place to gamble. CARDINAL RULES!
Cardinal Rule #1 You must know the rules of the gamethat you
intend to play for maximum results.
Cardinal Rule #2 Do not mix Neptune-ruledthings,i.e.,drinking
or drugs with gambling! Why do you think the "drinks are on
the house" in Vegas?It is also a fairly good idea to stay away
from some of the other offered vices,while gambling. 'Nuff said.
Cardinal Rule #3 Decidewhy you are going to gamble/ speculate.
A. Are you really going to win and show a profit?
B. Are you going to just have a good time?
C. Are you going just so that you can lose? If that last
soundsodd, many peopledo go to do just that. Because
losing verifies for them that whateverthey do in life, they
are "born losers." After all, if they should win at
gambling, that could be a threat. Winning heresuggests
they could win in all areasof life. Many people just
cannot handlethat idea. If you think you will lose,or
are afraid to lose, you will.
There are probably many more rqlsons for gambling than
I havementionedhere.I think it is extremelyimportant to really
be clear on why you are doing it!
Cardinal Rule # Júpiter Measure your own quotient of greed! It is
almost impossibleto turn $2 into $2,000or more at one shot at
the tables.Be reasonablein your expectations.It is far better to
turn $2 into $20 and later $20 into $200,etc.Neverbet what you
cannot afford to lose.
Cardinal Rule #5 You must learn money managementin any type
of gambling or speculation.Poor money managementis almost
a guaranteethat you will return a loser.If you are winning very
well at a casinoand plan to stay longer, it is wise to "lock up"
part of the profits, by sendingthem home, in the form of a check
made out to yourself. Money not in pocket, cannot be spent.
Cardinal Rule # 6 This is probably one of the most important.
Never, never say you are using astrology!!! CASINO PLAYING
Slot Machinesare probably the best thing to play for they
can be exactly timed, down to the second. Always play slot
machinesthat arehighly visiblein the casino.They aresetto pay
off much better than those hidden from view.
Slot machinesare set for payoff amount by the number of
stars,fruit, etc.,on eachreel.Each reelafter the standardthreereel increasesthe odds of winning by somethinglike 100,000to
one. So I would definitely suggestthat if your gameis playing
Slot Machines to stick with the three-reelmachines.Also, the
Dollar Slot Machines pay off more often than the others.
However, the investment is greater.
With any of the other casino games,you are more subject to what someoneelse is doing.
In Blackjack: you are affected by the dealer with his/her
transits and their particular natal potentials, the other players
at the table, the number of card decksthat are being used, the
number of players at the table and how long between shuffles.
In Craps: you are at the mercy of when the dice reachyou,
the number of players and how long it is betweenthe rolls of
the dice, unlessyou begin playing at the right time at an empty
table. And one of the most important factors in the game of
Craps is knowing the number of playersat the table and how
long the time is between the rolls of the dice. Another very
important thing in playing Craps is knowing how to bet! I have
seentoo many people walk away from the Crap table broke,
becausethey did not know how to bet. Crapstakeslearningboth
the game and how and what to bet on. It is a study in itself. Very
excitinggame, and you ciln win or lose large amounts in record
time.
Baccarat is not a game for the fainthearted. Usually the
minimum bet is $20. Thereare a few casinoswhereone can find
a $2 minimum game. As the bet is made either for the Player
or for the Bank, it is largely a game of intuition. A few people
do extremelywell at Baccarat.From experience,
it is very difficult
to stay clear on the intuitive wavelengthwith the number of
playersand their thoughts around the table.
Poker is a casino game where one is playing against other
players,not the casino.Many Saturdaynight poker playerswant
to try their luck in a casino, becausethey are so very proud of
their skill. However,at a casino many of the poker playersare
professionalpoker players;this is how they make their living,
day in and day out. The pros love to get a Saturdaynight player
into a game. When Ego entersa game, lossesoften occur. In a
professionalpoker game,to stayin the gameor drop out is often
determinedon the secondcard. Amateur playerswant to stay in
for that last card and that can indeed be costly. If Poker is your
game, you need skill, nervesof steeland the luck of the draw
Roulette is one of the games that has fosteredgrand and
glorious storiesof "Breaking the Bank." As the odds are played
at 38/1, it is often a game that drawsthe dreamsof the big win.
It can be a fascinatinggame of numbers.
Keno is another numbers game. The odds of any set of
numberscoming up in one game is really phenomenal.Often the
recommendationis to play your favoritenumbersand eventually
they will come up.
In playing any of the casino gamesthat involve a dealer it
is important to rememberthat the dealermay havea better natal
chart or better transitsthan you do. lf you are losing when you
should be winning, changedealersor evencasinos.Or go back
to your residenceawayfrom home and begin again.Do not chase
a losing streak.
InterestingFact: The dealersare one of the most consistent
featuresof the casinos.It is alwaysa good idea to "loke" (tip)
the dealers when you are winning. It is very important to
rememberthat their energyis in that particular table - especially
the crap table, where the dealersspendeight hours of each day.
"Toking" will have the dealerspulling for you to win. Because
if you win and you toke when you win - they win too. If
someone does not toke, particularly a person that is really winning large amounts, the dealerswill not give one hoot in youknow-where if you win or not. I have seen dealers rooting for
the players that are toking at a crap table and the energy is
incredibly high. Astrologers are more awareof energythat is put
out psychically ihan many other folk. Take advantage of the
knowledge.
You must know how to bet to survivein any casinogambling!
Knowing how to bet can be a key factor in being a winner after
all the chips are counted. WHAT IF YOUR CHART
IS NOT CORRECT?
One of the best ways to fine tune a chart is to get several
peopletogetherand play pennyblackjack(with limits, of course).
Use a table of housesexact to the minute for the location that
you are planning to play at and an exacttimepiece.Mark down
the times that either blackjack is dealt to you, or the times that
you reach 2l successfully.After severalhours, or daysor weeks
spentdoing this, you will find that you are able to fine tune your
chart by what degreeand minute was on one of the transiting
cusps at the exact moment of success.
One of the other methods to correct your chart is to play
the nickel slot machine, putting your nickels in every l0 to 15
secondsof time. Record the resultsvery carefully. I would not
suggestanything higher than nickels,until you fine tune your
natal chart. Dollar slots can be an expensiveway to find out if
your birth time is off by even a few minutes.
Winning Thansitscan be usedfor thingsother than speculation.
For instance,if you were involved with the markets,you could
easilyseetimes that you are making correctchoices.If you have
an important businessmeeting,you can tell when to thrust ahead
and when to excuseyourselffor a few minutes.Now the question
comesup: should this be done? If the knowledgeis yours, it is
yours to use - period!
One differencethat I haveseenoverthe yearsis that transits
are read differently for different people.lf a personis in a reactive
mode, then they are usually sitting back waiting for something
to happento them and it generallydoes.If a personis in an active
mode, then this is a personwho takesadvantageof the very best
of times and achievesthe desiredresults.
Everyonewill havetimes during any 24-hour period that are
better for them to gamble than other times. The trick is to wait
for thosetimesand really "run" with them. Then sit back and
wait for another very good time. lrt the so-so times go on by
without money involvement- or money losses.The best times
will differ with eachhoroscope.This is a highly individualistic
process.There are times in everyone'slife that they have good
potential as well as the reverse.To avoid the negativeindicators
and to utilizethe bestpossibletimescan be the differencebetween
winners and losers.
Timing is everything.
Astrology holds the keys to timing.
Now that you havethe keys.. .Utilize them!
May you have win after win! A WINNING EXAMPLE

Dear Neil and all the gang - - Hi, Anna, Thanks to your
"Winning Aspects" I noticed4 daysof not so good betting
aspectscoming up in Las Vegas.So I took off, and drove
my van to Los Angeles to try for a game show on TV. I
got in line early Monday morning without a ticket. A lady
came along and gave me her extra ticket for "The Price
Is Right." In the audience,I was pickedas a contestantand by the end of the show I was the top winner for the
day with $1,000cashand $10,500in prizeswhich included
a microwaveovenand a $7,500housetrailer!!! Jupiter had
crossedmy Grand Tiine in the secondhouseon Monday.
Tiinesbeingnothing for BlackJackbut greatfor something
you are chosenfor evidently.Needlessto say,I'm grateful
to you all for the fine serviceyou provided which put me
on the road to be a Winner! Vegasis OK too. I'm going
back now. Very gratefully, Bette Plutão .S.The show will be aired
April 14.
Postscript from the Publisher
I made a public statementat the 1978 AFA Convention
statingthat I wasgoing to try Joyce'ssystemwhen I visitedReno
(Nevada)the day after the closeof that convention. I further said
that if the systemworked for me eight times out of ten, I would
consider it valid.
I bet the dollar slots at the Golden Nugget from about 5
PM till 6:15PM and won $79. During that 1%-hour intervalI
actually bet for fourteenminutes. In addition to using the times
when I was "on the wheel," I had run my local spacechart for
Reno and oriented myself so that I walked to the slot machine
along my Jupiter,/Plutoconjunction lines. I also had the advice
of the presidentof the J-V Company,with whom I wastransacting
businessin Reno. He confirmed that I should bet only on the
dollar slots to get the best odds. He also encouragedme to
continueto bet when I waswinning - but I ignoredthat advice.
One October I visited Las Vegas with my then-wife Rosemarie when we were on a burof the Grand Canyon and the Bryce
National Monument in southern Utah. I won a modest $39 betting for nine minutes over a span of thirty-five minutes - that
is, I was "on the wheel" for only nine minutes out of a total of
thirty-five minutes. The third and fourth times I visited [,as Vegas
wereon stopoversfrom San Diego to Minneapolisand back. That
meant that I bet in the airport wherethe odds are probably the
worst in Las Vegasbecausethe airport, unlike the casinos,knows
it has no way of keeping you there by increasingthe payoff
percentage.You are going to make your connectionregardless
of how much you may be winning!
I won $81over the courseof two hours and ten minuteson
the outward-bound trip. Barbara Bethea, Fulfillment and
Marketing Manager for ACS Publications,Inc - waswith me,
waiting in the loungebeganto questionher
and other passengers
when I went off to the slot machine, bet for a minute or two,
then came back and sat down for severalminutes. Every time
I went off, they could hear the jingle of silverhitting the bottom
of the payoff cup - so they knew I was winning. Barbara then
explainedthe businesswe werein and the report we wereusing
and handed out a few order forms and one or two catalogs.
On the return portion of the trip, I was only about eight
or nine dollars ahead after betting on the last "on the wheel"
time slot beforeboarding the plane for San Diego.So I decided
to seewhat would happenif I bet "off the wheel."I quickly lost
the $ Mercúrio that I was ahead. Thus far my record has been four out
of four, which means if I win four out of the next six visits, I
will havefulfilled the condition of winning eight out of ten times
(to consider the systemvalid for me).
Not too long ago I was involved in a businesstransaction
with a San Diego numismatist. At the end of our business
dealingshe told me he was going to Las Vegaslater that day. I,
of course,told him about my own experienceand the Winning
Transits Report. He subsequentlycame by on his way to the
airport and picked up a report for the threedayshe expectedto
be in Las Vegas.The next time I saw him he said that he had
not bet anything at all until he was at the airport returning to
San Diego. He bet the quarter slotsand won $125!The husband
of a local SanDiego astrologeris a poker player,and he has been
using his Winning Tiansitsto determinethosetime periodswhen
he will take chancesbeyondwhat he would ordinarily take in an
attempt to maximize his winnings. He has reportedonly mixed
results.
I am impressedwith this approachto gambling,not because
I am a gambler or becauseI intend to use the systemto win a
lot of money,but becauseit is a mundanevalidationof astrology
that can be testedby just about anybody.And with the Winning
TransitsReport, one needsno knowledgeof astrologyto do the
testing.
May you win your fortune and have fun - but don't bet
more than you can afford to lose! The optionslisted in All AboutAstrologybookletsareall availablethrough:

OF THE TRANSITING SI-W PLIII\IETS
The Ouentieurwill not show the period between exact and ending. You can estimate the
endingtime bynotingthe time elapsedfrom start to exact, and dividing ltby 15. (The applying
orb is 15' of arc, and the separating orb is I'of arc.) Just add one fifteenth of the elapsed time
to the time when the aspect is exact, to get an approdmate ending tlme, whenyou are using
the Ouqtieu. An additional subtlety: this will not work f the transiting planet is near a
station, that is, just golng retrograde or direct. RECTIF"TING YOT'R BIRTHTIME USING WINNING TRAIIISITS 2 x 02: 50 0 Mercúrio : tl Mercúrio 0 Mercúrio r Sl

Joyce Wehrman advocated playlng for pennies when you test, because actual money

(however little) is changlng hands. This is a far better simulatlon of caslno play than, say, a

BlackJack is the best tool, because even a rank amateur can deal 5 to 1O hands of
blac$ack per minute, and thls allows exact timrng. Your frtend should be the dealer. S/he

You, as the person testlng, will play llke a fool, deltberately. Don't try to use any system,

Use an electronlc, dlgltal watch. Set your watch from the phone company's tlme
number before you ptray. Joyce Wehrman would call the U.S. Natlonal Bureau of Standarde, longdlstance, to
set her vratch-you
may want to save that for the l,ater stages of rectlSlng your chart.
Have a pencll and paper ready, and wrlte down the tlme, to the Eecond, as soon as you see that you have
been dealt a blackJack. In the event of a'push- (a Ue wtth the dealer), cross it out-you didn't wln!
When the plus perlod has passed, or when you are tJred of playlng, you wtll have your llst of the actual tlmee you

In the Ouqtiant and the Winning Transi$ '+" and '-" are marked according to rules that appear to be valtd for
large numbers of people. However, you, as an lndivldual, will probably not match the statisttcal average ln weryway.
A natal planet on which you 'should' win may not work f it ts badly alflicted natally. A planet on which you "should
not'winmaywork, if it is onthe midpoint oftwo activefactors lnyournatal chart. Youwlll have to flnd these thlngs
out by testtng them yourself.
There are factors not shovm in the Ouqtians and lUinning llansits that can'Jinx- you temporarily. If a midpoint
of transiting Mars/Saturn, Mars/Neptune, or Satum/Neptune is in hard aspect to anythtngf in your chart, within
2' of arc, you may lind that you don't win, no matter what else ls going on. Longer Jinx- periods may occur when
Neptune, or even Saturn, goes retrograde wtthln 2 degrees of hard aspect to an acUvefactorinyournatal. In that case,
you may not win much until the transiting planet has ftnally ended the aspect once and for all. Caution and prudence
