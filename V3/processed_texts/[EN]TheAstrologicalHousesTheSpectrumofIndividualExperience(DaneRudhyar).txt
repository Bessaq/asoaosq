EPILOGUE PART ONE WHY HOUSES?
Most astrologers would probably agree with the general statement that
astrology is the study of the correlations that can be established between the
positions of celestial bodies around the Earth and physical events or
psychological and social changes of consciousness in man. The motions of
celestial bodies are, with very few exceptions, cyclic and predictable. As far
as we can see, ours is a universe of order, even though this order is not too
apparent from close up, since from our position on Earth in the midst of the
happenings, involved in them, and emotionally reacting to them, we are
'unable to perceive the large picture of cosmic existence. When, however,
we consider celestial events which occur at an immense distance from us,
we can readily experience the majestic rhythms outlined on the background
of the sky: the rising and setting of the Sun, the Moon, and the stars, the
New and Full Moon, the conjunctions of planets and other periodic
phenomena. Thus astrology, by referring man's seemingly unpredictable
and aleatory experiences in his earthly environment to the rhythmic and
predictable changes in the position and the interrelationship of the celestial
bodies, gave to mankind a most valuable sense of order, which in turn
produced a feeling of at least transcendental security.
There are many ways in which man can react to and interpret his
realization that definite and at least relatively reliable correlations can be
established between what occurs in the universe around the Earth and outer
or inner changes in human lives. Quite obviously such reactions and
interpretations depend fundamentally on the stage of man's evolution in
terms of the capacity of his senses to perceive what happens in the sty, and
the state of development of his consciousness, his psychic faculties, and his
intellectual as well as physical tools for measuring and interpreting what he
experiences. All this finds expression in the social, religious, and cultural
environment which provides the star-gazer with a certain kind of language,
basic beliefs, and a socio-cultural way of life. To disassociate astrology from the state of the culture and the society in
which the astrologer lives and makes his calculations and interpretations is
quite senseless. Any conceptual system has to be understood in terms of the
conditions of life – social and personal, as well as geographical – of the
men who act, feel, and think. The “truth,” or rather the validity, of an action
or a thought can be ascertained only by referring it to the larger socialcultural picture, and, deeper still, to a particular phase of the evolution of
mankind, or at least of a section of mankind.
Because this often is not done, or done with a bias produced by
projecting one's present state of consciousness upon the minds and feelings
of men of archaic times and other races, much confusion arises. Astrology
is a particularly fertile field for confusion and the proliferation of
dogmatically stated opinions, whether or not these take the form of
supposedly scientific analyses and erudite compilations of texts or of
psychic hunches or “communications.” Many complex theories and
confusing interpretations have developed because astrology has been
thought of as a thing in itself, a mysterious “science” using a puzzling
terminology unchanged since ancient Chaldean times and supposedly still
valid. Yet this terminology quite obviously has failed to fully take into
account the radical changes in human consciousness and in man's
awareness of the Earth's and of his own place in the universe which has
occurred over these many centuries.
As a result the present wave of interest in astrology is encountering all
kinds of obstacles and flowing confusingly into various channels. Much of
the time this means losing sight of the basic function of astrology, which is
to bring a sense of order and harmonious, rhythmic unfolding to human
beings – not human beings as they were in old Egypt or China, but as they
are today with all their emotional, mental, and social problems.
Locality Centered Astrology in Archaic Times
Until the end of the “archaic” age in the sixth century B.C., when Gautama
the Buddha lived and taught in India and Pythagoras in the Hellenistic
world, the consciousness of men – with perhaps rare exceptions – was fundamentally locality-centered. Relatively small groups of human beings
lived, felt, and thought in terms of what one can best define as “tribal”
values. Tribal groups, the basic elements of human society at the time, were
as bound to the particular land from which they drew their subsistence as an
embryo is bound to the mothers womb. The tribe constituted an organism;
every member of it was totally integrated into this multi-cellular organism.
Each member of the tribe was dominated psychically by the way of life, the
culture, the beliefs, and the symbols of the group, whose taboos he or she
could not disobey. There were no real “individuals” at this stage of human
evolution; all the values upon which the culture and beliefs of the group
were founded were expressions of particular geographical and climateric
conditions, and of a particular racial type. The tribal community looked to
the past for the symbol, if not the fact, of its unity; that is, to a common
ancestor, or to some divine king who had brought it a revealed kind of
knowledge and a special psychic cohesion.
The astrology which developed at this stage was also locality-centered
far more than truly geocentric, that is. Earth-centered. Every tribal village
had a central place which was considered to be either the center of the
world, or the entrance to a secret path that led to such a center. What we
today call the horizon defined the boundaries of life. Above it, the sky was
the habitat of the great creative hierarchies of gods. The dark region below
the horizon was the mysterious underworld to which the Sun retired every
night to regain the strength needed to bring light again to man's horizontal
world. It is of course possible that a few priest-initiates were aware that the
Earth was a globe which revolved around the Sun; but if there was such a
secret tradition communicated orally through rites of initiation, it apparently
had no bearing on astrology.
For primitive, tribal man, astrology was an integral part of religious
symbolism as well as a means to foresee periodic natural occurrences
affecting the life of the community and especially its agricultural activities
or the mating of the cattle. In such a condition of life and with human
consciousness focused upon the soil and the total welfare of the organic
community, astrology was quite simple. It was essentially based on the rise,
culmination, and setting of all celestial bodies – “stars” as well as the two
“Lights,” Sun and Moon. Two categories of “stars” were readily
differentiated. Most of the stars as they rose and set kept their relationships to each other unchanging; that is, as they traveled around the sky, the
pattern these dots of light made remained “fixed.” Other celestial bodies,
on the contrary, moved independently of each other and at times appeared
to go backward; they were called “wanderers,” which is what the word
planet originally meant. Some of these planets appeared to the trained
observer as small discs, rather than dots of light, and they were considered
to form a category of celestial objects very different from the stars. Their
periodic conjunctions were noticed, and their motions were plotted so that
they could be measured and conjunctions foreseen.
Plotted against what? The obvious background or frame of reference
was the permanent pattern of the distant stars. We must, however, realize
that to the archaic mind the stars were not fixed. They were observed to rise
and set. The only thing actually fixed was the horizon. Nevertheless the
overall geometrical pattern which the stars made on the dark background of
clear subtropical and desertic skies remained the same for centuries. It
could therefore serve as a frame of reference, if it was subdivided for the
convenience of measurement.
In order to understand how the concept of zodiacal constellations arose
and the symbolic form it took, one need only realize that all tribal societies,
as far as we know, used totems. These totems were associated with clans
within the tribe; and these clans, in a sense, represented functional organs
within the total organism of the tribe. Most often totems were animals with
whom the men of a clan felt that they had some special relationship. They
could, however, also be natural objects such as plants.
When men of past eras sought to give a more definite form and
permanence to their society they sought to model it upon principles of
functional organic order. The cosmos was felt to be an organic whole
animated by a bipolar universal Life-force, symbolized in astrology by the
two Lights, in Chinese philosophy by the Yang and Yin principles active
within all forms of existence. Indeed, Sky and Earth were seen ideally as
two polarities, the former creative and divine, the latter receptive and
fruitful, but filled with wild disharmonic energies which had to be
integrated and domesticated – from domus, meaning “house.” The wise
man – the “Celestial” in China – stood as it were in the midst of these
polarities, partaking of both Sky and Earth. His task was to impress creative
Order upon earthly nature and to organize society according to cosmic rhythms and principles. In some cases the reverse process also operated,
and totems were projected upon the Sky in order to emphasize the close
connections which the clans felt they had with their celestial equivalents.
Thus constellations were named after various tribal totems. Later on, the
symbol of the Grand Man in the Sky, whose every organ corresponded to a
constellation, was established.
This type of thinking prevailed in Greece, where heroes were
transferred to the sky after their death and constellations were named after
them. Later, in Medieval Europe, in alchemical and occult circles, the Sky
was referred to as Natura naturans and Earth-Nature as natura naturata –
the creative and receptive polarities of life.
In regions such as Egypt and Mesopotamia the seasonal factor is not as
obvious as in more northern European regions; but the inundations of the
Nile marked the most crucial moment of the yearly cycle. Astrologers here
were first of all star-gazers and it is safe to assume that their zodiac referred
to the constellations. Again let me stress that astrology at this point was
locality- centered much more than Earth-centered. No Egyptian astrologer
would have worried about what could be observed in the sky of the polar
regions, or of the southern hemisphere. These worrisome problems began to
appear only when it became known that the Earth was a globe revolving
around the Sun, together with the other planets – when Western men began
to travel and look at skies very different from those of Europe.
When this happened the old astrology became if not completely
obsolescent, at least loaded with obsolete concepts and with an archaic
terminology which in many instances no longer flakes any real sense. A
great number of long observed and tabulated correlations between
occurrences in the sky and events in the Earth's biosphere have certainly
remained valid. But this validity now belongs to a new order of human
reality. The consciousness of men who think in terms of the heliocentric
system and travel all over the globe has lost at least a great deal of its
binding attachment to a particular geographical locality, and society is no
longer operating at a local or a tribal level. Men have been released from
the tribe, “individualized” and uprooted, and even if some of them are still
in fact locality-bound, in theory and in terms of the new universalistic
religions. Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, they feel themselves to be, and are
regarded as, “individuals.” If astrologers fail to take in consideration such historical, spiritual,
intellectual, and social-cultural facts, remaining blind to the basic realities,
the confusion arising from the use of obsolete terms and concepts will be
perpetuated and the most basic issues will remain misunderstood.
The above paragraphs form an indispensable background for the student
as he comes to familiarize himself with the concept of astrological houses.
What are houses for? How did the concept arise, and what has become of it
in modem astrology? How many houses should there be, and what are the
complex problems one faces in determining the boundaries, or “cusps,” of
these houses?
To answer these questions in detail is beyond the scope of this book.
But a few basic points should be stated as clearly and simply as possible
before we come to the study of the four Angles in astrological charts, and of
the different levels of meaning which should be attributed to the twelve
houses as they are used at present.
Zodiacs and Houses
From the point of view of archaic astrology, the concept of houses was very
simple and posed few problems. As we saw a few paragraphs back, the
astrologer needed a frame of reference or background on which to pinpoint
exactly the positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets, and their
angular distances from each other when seen from the particular area in
which the tribal group lived. But the astrologer probably realized sooner or
later that there were two possible frames of reference. One of them was the
unchanging patterns made by those star groups – constellations – which are
found close to the ecliptic; that is, close to the narrow band or belt in the
sky along which the Sun, the Moon, and the planets move. Such a frame of
reference is obviously spatial: celestial bodies moving over the spatially
extended shapes of the zodiacal constellations.
The other frame of reference was most specifically a durational one, for
it defined the time it takes for celestial bodies to rise in the East, culminate
overhead and set in the West. What is involved in such a type of
measurement is, in modern terms, the daily rotation of the celestial sphere above and below the horizon. Such a rotation provided the ancient
astrologer with the concept of “hours” and also of “watches,” for especially
during the night men had to be on watch for possible dangerous intrusions,
whether of predatory animals or human enemies. The watchers worked in
relays of two or three hours.
In the daytime it was the motion of the Sun around the visible sky
which was the basic factor, for its changing elevation resulted in changes of
temperature which in turn affected all or most human activities in
agricultural societies. Changes in solar elevation could easily be reduced to
the crossing by the Sun of various sections of his daily path around the
visible sky; thus the time factor could be analyzed also as a space factor –
actually the basis of the sundial, which measures time in terms of space.
But this kind of space could be interpreted as strictly “terrestrial” space,
while the space defined by constellations was “celestial” space; the
differentiation was no doubt most significant at a time when the Sky-Earth
polarity was the basis of a vast number of concepts with endless possible
applications. This difference is still important to many astrologers, as we
shall see presently.
When the modern astrologer speaks of these two frames of reference for
the measuring of the motion of Sun, Moon, and planets he at once mentions
that the first refers to the apparent yearly motion of the Sun around the
zodiac – which today we understand to be in fact the revolution of the Earth
around its orbit, the ecliptic – and the second to the daily rotation of our
globe around its polar axis; but quite obviously this was not the way in
which the ancients thought of the matter. And what is important are not the
so-called “facts” – as we see them today – but the meaning man gives to his
immediate and direct experiences. Astronomy deals with observable facts,
while astrology is the study of the meaningful, rational or irrational,
responses that man gives to these facts in terms of his concept of the nature
and character of the universe.
But to return to the two frames of reference used for the measure of the
positions, the angular relationships, and the cycles of Sun, Moon, and
planets: the first one is what we today call the zodiac; the second, the circle
of houses. But these terms and the way they are defined and used are very
ambiguous. You can conceive any number of “zodiacs” depending on what
you want to measure; likewise our modern astrological houses and the “watches” of archaic astrology are very different – different in number, in
size, and in meaning. We will try to throw some light on these ambiguities
and to clarify the position taken by astrology in the western world.
First we should realize that the first zodiacs were most probably lunar
zodiacs divided into 27 or 28 sections, usually called “asterisms” or lunar
mansions. Obviously one cannot normally see the star groups over which
the Sun passes at any time of the year; one has to deduce this Sun's position
from the stars that rise or set just after sunset. It is far simpler to ascertain
the position of the Moon at night in relation to the stars. Thus a stellar
frame of reference for the Moon's monthly cycle is indeed the more logical,
especially for nomads who raised cattle which had to be watched at night1.
Then one should consider the fact that the yearly cycle of the Sun
through the constellations could also be measured in another manner. We
speak today of the yearly motion of the Sun in longitude along the zodiacal
path; but it can be measured equally well in terms of changes in
declination. What this means is simply that sunsets never occur at exactly
the same place in the western horizon. Only at the time of the spring and
fall equinoxes does the Sun set exactly West. At the solstice of summer it
sets about 23½ degrees to the North-West; at the winter solstice, about the
same number of degrees to the South-West. Moreover, there are also
changes in the elevation of the Sun in the Sky throughout the year, which
determines the ever-varying angle at which the lays strike the Earth's
surface, and as a result the seasonal changes in temperature and climate.
There were great cultures which erected huge stones at the western
horizon in order to measure the position of the Sun in its yearly cycle of
changes in declination – which in turn was related to seasonal changes.
Whether these cultures also used a zodiac of constellations may not be too
easy to determine, though both types of measurements may have been
known – the zodiacal type referring mainly to the Moon, the declination or
seasonal type to the Sun.
The concept of the zodiac became ambiguous and lent itself to much
confusion when astrologers became fully aware of the motion called
“precession of the equinoxes,” which introduces a constantly increasing
discrepancy between seasonal and stellar measurements. With the
reappearance of the sidereal zodiac (constellations) in western astrological tradition, which for many centuries had exclusively used the tropical zodiac
of signs referring to the fixed pattern of equinoxes and solstices, this
confusion has become more pronounced.
I shall not discuss here in detail the values of these two solar zodiacs,
which most unfortunately use the same terms – Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc.–
to refer to two different sets of factors. I shall only say that while the
sidereal zodiac divides the band of twelve constellations whose boundaries
are most uncertain and have been altered several times – the last time, some
forty years ago – the tropical zodiac refers to a clearly known and precisely
measured factor, the Earth's orbit. It depends also on equally clear factors,
such as the equinox and solstices, with definite seasonal implications which
are very significant in the lives of human beings living in the temperate
regions of the northern hemisphere – it is our western civilization that today
is dominating the whole world2.
There seems to be little doubt that the archaic civilization of which we
have record used zodiacs – lunar and/or solar – which were “sidereal,” that
is, based on constellations; but these civilizations did not conceive or image
the universe as we have since the Greek period and especially since the
early European Renaissance. Moreover, these early civilizations were found
in somewhat different regions of the globe and under different climatic
conditions. And I cannot stress too much the basic importance of these facts
when we try to discuss and evaluate astrological data and techniques.
The Eight “Watches”
Let us now consider the second frame of reference which can be and has
been used for the measuring of the positions of Sun, Moon, and planets,
namely, the circle of the astrological houses.
It is indeed most likely, as the late Cyril Fagan pointed out not long ago,
that in archaic astrology what we now call houses were periods of time –
“watches” – which were based on the rise, culmination, and setting of the
Sun. These were divisions of the solar day into four basic periods, the
fourth significant moment of the cycle being postulated as a counterpart to
the culmination of the Sun at noon, that is, midnight. One should understand the philosophical-psychological as well as the
cosmological meaning of this fourfold pattern which dominates astrological
thinking. The fourfold division of any cycle rests on the realization of the
dualism inherent in all existence and in human consciousness. l have
already mentioned the polarity of day and night, light and darkness,
conscious activity and sleep, Yang and Yin. In the philosophies of India we
find constant reference to the states of “manifestation” and
“nonmanifestation.” In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna as the embodiment of
the universal Self (Brahman) states that he is the beginning, middle, and
end of all cycles. But these existential cycles are only “half cycles,” for
every period of cosmic manifestation (manvantara) is balanced by a period
of nonmanifestation (pralaya)– a cosmic day by a metacosmic night.
The periods of transition between these days and nights – whether in the
cosmos or in human experience – are the most significant moments of
existence. They are symbolized in human terms by the horizon, because this
horizon divides the daily motion of the Sun into two basic periods,
separated by sunrise and sunset. In near-tropical regions dawn and dusk are
brief. The day bursts out quickly and night falls rapidly – a fact of great
importance if one wishes, unwisely, I believe, to transfer certain ideas – for
instance, the concept of “cusp” – belonging to a subtropical astrology to the
astrology valid for temperate and high-latitude countries.
The awakening to conscious living – dawn, the alpha point of the day
cycle – and the conclusion of the day's activity at sunset – the omega point
– are and always have been basic in astrology, as well as in religious and
cultural symbolism. Noon is the point of culmination of effort, leading –
especially in hot climates – to a phase of nourishment and rest. In polar
opposition to it, midnight is the time of deepest mystery, a very magical
time.
A further division of this fourfold pattern in time was logical, especially
when linked with the need to define the length of night watches. A threehour period is quite fitting for such watches, and the 45-degree angle is
easily calculated when the advance of the Sun in the sky is plotted on the
horizontal plane of the sundial. This 45-degree measure has had a great deal
of meaning in occultism and apparently is very significant when electrical
and magnetic force fields are studied today. The eightfold division is probably also related to the attribution of the
number 8 to the Sun. In India the chariot of the Sun god was driven by eight
white horses, and the numerical symbol which the Gnostics attributed to the
Christ as a Solar Principle – Rudolph Steiner spoke of Christ as a great
“Solar Archangel” – was 888, or 8 operating at the three levels of
consciousness, biological, mental, and spiritual3.
Cyril Fagan recently claimed that the eightfold division of an
astrological chart was the earliest on record, and he pointed out that these
eight “watches” were given meaning in terms of the progress of the Sun
around the sky in a clockwise direction – and also in terms of the types of
activities most characteristic of the four watches elapsing between sunrise
and sunset. He is most likely correct in such an assumption, but only as it
applies to the type of agricultural society of ancient times, even though
evidently such a pattern of activity still exists wherever men live close to
the soil they cultivate or to the animals they raise. It is a vitalistic pattern,
and the Sun is always to be considered in astrology the source of the Lifeforce. But as man becomes more and more divorced from, indeed alienated
from, the soil and the instinctual, seasonal rhythms of life – as man
develops an individualistic mind and an ambitious ego – the vitalistic
patterns lose much of their meaning. A new set of problems develops, and
today it is the solution of these new problems that is the main task for
astrology. Why? Because it is at this level of psychomental
individualization that modem man's most crucial needs exist. And
everything has value in terms of its ability to answer to the need of mankind
– whether it be astrology, or medicine, or science and knowledge in general.
Modern man's individualistic psychomental rhythm operates in
counterpoint to that of soil-bound and locality-centered human beings. This
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that in terms of contemporary
consciousness, it is known that the planet Earth rotates on its axis, and not
that the Sun moves daily around it. Thus the entire picture is changed, and
we see the sequence of the modern astrological houses numbered and
interpreted counterclockwise. Man's consciousness, mind, and sense of
individual selfhood grow and unfold from potentiality at birth to a gradually
more complete state of actualization in opposition to the rhythm of the
Life-force. This inevitably produces individual problems, conflicts, and psychological complexes. But it is the human way to maturity, self-reliance,
and creative fulfillment as a “person.”
Two Basic Approaches to the Sun
From the archaic astrological point of view the determination of “watches”
was simple enough, for they were nothing but divisions of the time it took
the Sun to move around the dome of the Sky from sunrise to sunset. When
astrologers were able to define the position of the Sun at any moment with
reference to zodiacal stars and constellations, it was relatively easy to
determine the approximate zodiacal positions of the beginnings of the eight
watches at three-hour intervals. No special problem was involved, and the
closer one lived to the equator the more harmonic the picture was.
When, however, one considers the Earth as a globe rotating on its axis
and revolving around the Sun, and one seeks to build an astrological system
which is no longer “locality-centered” but “globe-centered,” and yet is
relevant to individual persons who experience the universe from a particular
point on the surface of this globe, all sorts of difficulties are met. Now
three-dimensional facts are somehow to be projected upon a twodimensional sheet of paper. At least three sets of coordinates can be used –
local, equatorial, and ecliptical. To make matters much worse, the
conservative and tradition-oriented attitude of most astrologers has impelled
them to keep using many terms and figures of speech which fitted the
archaic world-view but no longer make sense today in terms of our
astronomical knowledge. Astronomers themselves have not done much
better in some cases by using the same terms to refer to two sets of facts –
for instance, longitude and latitude – and retaining old names.
There is not space here to go into technical details involving spherical
geometry and the various systems of house division, that is, domification.
Still, it is important for the modern student of astrology to realize that what
he usually takes for granted in dealing with the houses of a birth chart is
susceptible of several basically different interpretations. Cyril Fagan, who
reintroduced the concept of the sidereal zodiac, also sought not only to
promote the division of a chart into eight houses but to interpret their sequence in a clock-wise direction. This probably was the ancient practice,
at least in some regions, but Pagan's error was, I believe, to force archaic
vitalistic beliefs upon modem individuals. We might as well accept
Chaldean mythology as a basis for a renewal of religion! Every time and
every culture has its own characteristic needs, and today we require an
astrology which meets the needs of psychologically oriented, confused, and
alienated egos – and particularly the needs of a large number of modem
youths who, probably for the first time in history, have become fascinated
by astrology, and this for very definite even if often largely unconscious,
reasons.
The meaning of the astrological houses, as they have been used in the
Christian-European culture, is intimately related to the zodiac, arid it is at
least one of the reasons why western-style astrology has used a twelvehouse system. Therefore I must again refer to the zodiac.
By analyzing recorded horoscopes in Greece, Alexandria, or Rome, one
may prevent a good case for the claim that the shift from a sidereal to a
tropical zodiac – that is, from constellations to signs representing equal
degree sections of the ecliptic – was due to an improper knowledge of
astronomical facts, to a general confusion in the minds of men living during
a disturbed period of history – which, in a sense, rather closely parallels, at
a different level, our own time. But conclusions of this kind are usually
superficial, and do not, I believe, give the deeper philosophical reasons for
the adoption of this zodiac. Too much is left to chance and to the mistakes
of one or more individuals. Something much deeper is at stake, and it
remains a fundamental issue today, though in a different way. The issue is
metaphysical and cosmological, and it deals with the meaning to be given to
the Sun.
A few pages back I stated that the constellations were originally devised
in order to provide a convenient background on which to plot out the
motions of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets. This may have been the way
in which the relationship of the Sun to the constellations was thought of at a
certain period of history, but there is abundant evidence that in archaic
times this relationship was also given a different, almost dramatically
opposite meaning – a meaning which is still very significant in terms of a
type of metaphysical thinking which I have developed elsewhere.
According to this approach, the Sun is to be considered only as a channel or lens through which the energies of cosmic Space are focused and directed
upon the Earth and every living organism on it.
From the one point of view, the Sun is the dominant factor and the
constellations merely form a background for measuring its motion and its
cyclically altered relationship to the Earth. In the second case, the active
factor is space itself – and we would say today galactic space. The Sun is
only a focalizing instrument – some occultists have said “a window”
through which pour day in and day out the immense energies of a space
which is far more than three-dimensional and physical.
These two concepts of the fundamental nature of the Life-force can be
called respectively monotheistic and pantheistic. Any student of religion
knows how fiercely the Christian church has fought against anything related
to pantheism. Witness the condemnation by the Roman Catholic Church a
few years ago of Teilhard de Chardin's world view, in spite of his constant
efforts to disclaim any pantheistic influence.
In archaic astrology, at least in some countries, the twelve constellations
were understood to be the collective bodies of “creative hierarchies”
belonging to a cosmic “World of Formation” – which in its totality might
today be called the Divine Mind. From this point of view the Sun – and in a
secondary way the Moon and the planets – were thought to be agencies that
mobilized and released the creative energies of this Divine Mind. Other
constellations might also be creative aspects of this Divine Mind but
because they did not have in the Sun and the planets direct channels to step
down their energies to the level of human vibrations and consciousness
they were only rarely effective in a human sense. The twelve zodiacal
hierarchies were therefore the only ones truly in charge of life processes on
Earth.
Such a cosmic picture was essentially “pantheistic,” even if the
metaphysical seer was able dimly to envision beyond this “sphere of the
fixed stars” a still more transcendent realm, the realm of the Primum
Mobile, or in more philosophical terms that of the forever unknowable
Absolute, the Ain Soph of the Kabbalah. In contrast to it we have the
“monotheistic” world picture in which the One God manifesting Himself
vividly and personally to man is represented by the Sun, the solar I AM, the
Egyptian Aton. From this monotheistic point of view what is basic in human existence
is the relationship between the creature man and his Creator, between the
human and the divine. This relationship, in terms of astrological symbolism,
becomes the relationship between the Earth and the Sun; and this
relationship is expressed in the orbit of the Earth. Every month of the year –
the high point of the month being the Full Moon, or for some people the
New Moon – represents the development of one of twelve basic responses
of human nature to its twelve essential types of Soul consciousness, twelve
avenues through which the one divine Life can find means of expression.
From this point of view therefore the zodiac is logically and inevitably
an “orbital” factor. It is the Earth's orbit, to which we keep giving the old
and not very revealing name “ecliptic” – a name which has little to do with
what it factually as well as symbolically represents. The stars then
constitute a background on which the great “dialogue” between the basic
types of men and the one God is carried on. They constitute a wondrous
cosmic scenery on the universal stage. Nevertheless, some individual stars
may become significantly involved in human affairs, but if they do, they
refer to supernormal Visitations which more often than not intrude in, and
tend to disturb the dialogue between earthly man and his Creator – that is,
the Sun.
As the planets, from this orbital and heliocentric point of view, are also
creations of the Sun, and as the light or rays they reflect upon the Earth
have their source in the Sun, they simply differentiate or modulate the
original solar Power, the God power of creation. It is therefore logical to
interpret their positions and mutual relationships in terms of the Earth's
orbit Indeed the orbits of the planets – some inside, others outside of the
Earth's orbit – can be considered force fields which act upon the
relationship between the Earth and the Sun. The Moon is especially
significant in this way because as it revolves every month around the Earth,
it distributes – symbolically at least – the energies released by the Sun at
New Moon and reflected at all times by the planets.
Because of the paramount importance of the Earth-Sun relationship, it
was almost inevitable that the basic twelvefold classification of the main
aspects of the year-long cyclic pattern of changes in this relationship should
be applied to the circle of houses. Twelve houses were believed to match and to be closely related to the twelve signs – not constellations – of the
zodiac. But we should clearly understand how this was done.
The old locality-centered astrological outlook had become globecentered – geocentric. The orbital-zodiacal relationship Earth-to-Sun was
transferred to the entire Earth-globe, rather than to a particular locality
bounded by its horizon. This can be seen clearly from the fact that what we
call the “horizon” today in astrology – the “rational” horizon of astronomy
– is a great circle which passes through the center of the globe. It is not the
local horizon of the place for which a chart is made; it is only parallel to the
local horizon.
This local horizon is to be understood as a “mean horizon” which does
not take into consideration whether a person is born in a deep valley or on a
mountaintop – a difference which is, after all, extremely small compared to
the size of our globe, so that when the Earth's surface is seen from several
thousands of miles above it, even the highest mountains appear almost
insignificant in size. Besides, all astrology today deals with “mean
positions” rather than with actual ones, which makes sense once we
consider astrology to be a language made up of archetypal symbols and
essentially “numerological” in the attribution of specific meanings to the
separate factors constituting a cyclic series – that is, the series of zodiacal
signs, of houses, and even of the planets in terms of their distance from the
Sun.
But, to return to the relationship between the twelve zodiacal signs and
the twelve houses. What is implied in the manner in which the traditional or
classical type of European astrology interprets this relationship is the idea
that the zodiacal signs refer to the energy substance of life processes' while
the houses deal with the existential, concrete, and circumstantial ways in
which these processes operate during the life-span of an individual, or of a
collective social entity. For at least some European astrologers today, the
zodiac – of “signs” – is the positive force field from which flow all energies
operating in the Earth's biosphere; the circle of houses, then, represents the
receptive and sensitive terrestrial realm. This, in more modem terms, is the
theistic differentiation of God the creator and man the creature.
The two polarities, divine and human, are in principle symmetrical.
Man's “destiny” is written, not in the stars but in the tropical zodiac which
refers to man's dynamic celestial nature, natura naturans. The actual “circumstances” according to which this celestial destiny works out in his
daily life are indicated in the houses, and by the positions of planets. Sun,
and Moon in these houses. The two cyclic series, signs and houses, are thus
obviously progressing in the same direction, that is, counterclockwise.
This is and has been the basic attitude of the western astrology which
we still find taught – with individual variations – in most text-books.
Unfortunately, the terminology used is often confusing, because many of
the archaic and “pantheistic” concepts are still in evidence. The spread of
“sidereal astrology” is making the confusion worse. Historically speaking,
Mr. Fagan and his followers are probably right, as long as they speak of the
archaic past – a past which is still affecting the many conflicting schools of
astrology in India, land of spiritual traditions. But psychologically speaking
they have failed to understand the deep change in human mentality that
took place partly during the Greco-Latin period and even more during the
European Renaissance. They do not understand, as I see it, the crucial need
of human beings today; and their involvement in scientific techniques and
their claim that astrology has value as an entity in itself – that is, as a
system which must be recognized by the “scientific community” – seems
irrelevant in terms of the present needs of our society in crisis – unless, of
course, one believes that the future of mankind will be determined by an
even more total reliance on technology and on the analytical intellect and its
processes.
This does not mean that there is no validity in the siderealist's approach,
or that the classical techniques of European astrology are in many ways
confusing and obsolete. There is never a clear-cut question of “good” or
“bad” in social-cultural, religious, or scientific matters, for the simple
reason that all human minds do not operate at any time on only one
wavelength. The world still contains a great number of archaic, localitycentered, race-bound people and of nationalistic individuals worshiping
more or less dogmatically the “great heritage” of their particular country
and/or culture. The demand for fortune-telling in terms of specific events is
as great as it ever was, and probably greater; and the search for comfort,
egocentric happiness, sensual enjoyment, and social prestige is still the
drive of most human beings in our affluent and deeply polarized, neurotic
society. Astrology adjusts itself to the mentality and emotional expectations of
the person who comes to it as a practitioner as well as a client – just as
psychology does, and even medicine. You get what you give. As you ask, so
will the answer be. What you want to know and, in most constructive
situations, what you need to know condition, if not entirely determine, the
kind of knowledge you will gain.
Person-Centered Astrology
We are living in an age of extreme individualism, and the “humanistic”
approach to astrology which I have been formulating for many years seeks
to bring to individual persons a more conscious realization of the deeper
meaning of their experiences, so that they may be able to fulfill both their
essential individuality and their destiny, that is, their place and function in
the universe. In this type of astrology the human being is not understood to
be exterior to his birth chart; he or she is not supposed to “rule” it by
repressing its “bad” features and seeking to profit from the “good” ones.
The birth chart is seen as the formula structurally defining a man's
“fundamental nature.” It is a complex cosmic symbol – a word or logos
revealing what the person is potentially. It is the individual person's
“celestial name,” and also a set of instructions on how a person can best
actualize what at his birth was only pure potential – “seed potentiality.” The
birth chart is a mandala, a means to achieve an all-inclusive integration of
the personality.
I have developed these ideas at great length in many books and a large
number of articles. Once they are well understood and emotionally as well
as intellectually assimilated, it should be obvious that the entire approach to
the interpretation of the basic factors in astrology has inevitably to change –
otherwise the psychological results for the client, and for the astrologer as
his own client, could be unfortunate, if not at times disastrous. Essentially
the approach should not be “ethical,” that is, based on a dualistic attitude –
good-bad, fortunate-unfortunate. No birth chart should be considered
“better” than any other, even if obviously some charts indicate “easier” lives than others – but great and creative persons very rarely have an easy
existence, inwardly if not outwardly.
Such a type of astrology, aiming at answering the needs of men, women,
and adolescents in our individualistic society, must cast a new light upon
most of the old concepts of astrology, especially where the nonconforming
youth seeking to build a new way of life is concerned. A humanistic
astrology must be person- centered because its basic concern is the
development of the individual person – development in consciousness and
feelings as well as development through external actions. And this personcenteredness has very definite implications and practical-technical
consequences, for what such an astrology seeks to define and interpret is the
direct relationship of the individual person to the whole universe, which, in
practical terms, means his relationship to our galaxy considered as a cosmic
“organism.”
Archaic astrology was, as I stated, locality-centered. European astrology
in its classical form was Earth-centered, the Earth being studied as a globe.
What we need now, in a more definite and consistent sense than has been
attempted during the past decades of this psychology-oriented century, is a
person-centered approach to all the contents of our galactic universe. This
approach is perhaps, in one respect, closer to the locality-centered archaic
astrology than to the globe-centered astrology of the recent past; but the
role of the locality – the character of which affected a tribal group of as yet
non-individualized human beings swayed by vitalistic urges – should now
be taken by an individual person, at least partially able to develop an
independent, totally open, creative, and conscious approach to his total
environment, cosmic as well as biospheric and social.
Such a change of emphasis will be particularly evident when we
approach the topics of natal houses to which this book is devoted. I shall
attempt to define the practical consequences of the new perspective; but I
wish to stress from the outset that the change cannot yet be effected fully
with the astronomical data at our disposal. Much more has to be known
concerning the galaxy and its millions of stars. Still, we can begin to
reorient our interpretations in the direction of what should develop fully in
the centuries to come. In fact, insofar as natal houses are concerned, this
reorientation does not greatly alter the meaning traditionally given to them,
or at least most of them, but it introduces new levels of meaning and it particularly shifts the main emphasis, insofar as planetary positions are
concerned, from zodiacal signs to houses. The drawback of course is that
such a shift requires that the precise moment of a person's first breath be
known. But modem hospital techniques and parental interest are now
lessening the difficulty of meeting such a requirement. THE HOUSES AS THE BASIC ASTROLOGICAL FRAME OF
REFERENCE
When a human being is born at a particular time and in a particular place on
the surface of the Earth he is surrounded on all sides by celestial bodies,
visible in the sky or invisible below the horizon. Astrology states that the
positions of these celestial bodies, if related to the newborn and if this
relationship is significantly interpreted, define the basic structural
character of this child's biological - and psychic organism as well as the
manner in which his potential at birth will or should be actualized through a
series of personal experiences.
The word “person” can refer to collective persons, such as a business
firm, a nation, or even a very definite sequence of organized social activities
– the reign of a king or the taking office of a Presidential administration –
but in this book I shall discuss only matters pertaining to individual persons.
This is the field of “natal” astrology, and, as I see it, no system of natal
astrology makes much sense today if it is not actually “person-centered.”
A person-centered astrology deals with the relationship between a
person and the universe which surrounds him – his cosmic environment.
When we are dealing with a relationship, at least two factors must be
considered: in the case of person-centered astrology, the individual human
organism which at its first breath came to be independently, directly, and
organically related to the universe, and the celestial bodies all of which
move around him in cyclic patterns.
Nothing in the universe is “fixed”; everything moves. Such movement,
however, is meaningless if it is not observed by and interpreted in relation
to a conscious person. We live in a world of relativity, but this relativity can
be given a consciously defined meaning only in terms of a particular frame
of reference and according to an at least relatively stable focus of
perception. An individual person is a relatively stable entity, for although
his body is obviously in a state of constant electrical and chemical
transformation, and his consciousness likewise is never quite the same, nevertheless the genetic pattern in his cells – or whatever these genes
biologically represent – remains the same from birth to death. He normally
retains his original name and speaks his native language whose words and
syntax play a most fundamental part in forming his mentality; he is a
relatively permanent social unit belonging to a culture which but rarely
experiences radical change even in spite of revolutionary crises.
Modern science has its “universal constants.” They probably are only
relatively constant and universal, but they serve as a frame of reference,
without which hardly any “law of nature” could be considered reliable.
Philosophers with a religious bent – cf. Aldous Huxley – speak of a
“perennial philosophy” and occultists refer to a “universal tradition” or an
“original revelation,” both of which represent a stable, solid, secure
foundation for beliefs considered essential to the mental, spiritual, and
emotional welfare of mankind. Eastern, and even some types of western,
mysticism may appear to surrender all sense of security and solidity, but
mystics aim at total identification with God or complete absorption into a
“unitive state,” and to speak of God, Brahman, Nirvana, or Tao is to refer to
a changeless, absolute condition which constitutes in itself a supreme state
of stability, eyen if it implies constant change insofar as partial points of
view and individual existential formations are concerned.
Astrology, in its traditional western sense, likewise has its “relatively
stable” frame of reference: the zodiac. This zodiac may be conceived of in
terms of constellations – fixed patterns of stars which appear fixed because
in relation to us they are extremely slow-moving – or in terms of twelve
divisions of the Earth's orbit, an orbit whose shape changes but slightly
through long periods of time – tropical zodiac. Either of these systems
meets the need for a relatively stable frame of reference. What I have been
suggesting in various writings is the possibility of another kind of frame of
reference – a person-centered one better adapted to the needs and the
character of a modem individual. I shall speak of it, at first, as the cross of
horizon and meridian.
The reader familiar with astrological textbooks or even astrological
magazine articles will probably think that there is nothing new in such a
frame of reference. Every modern birth chart, he will say, contains a line
which is called “horizon” and a vertical line, the “meridian.” But names are
ambiguous and can be misleading. As already stated, the astrological – and astronomical – horizon is a circle that passes through the center of the
globe. It does not refer to either the “sensible” horizon – which can be very
limited if one is at the bottom of a canyon – or what I call the “mean”
horizon – which refers to the circle of space that would be visible for an eye
on the surface of a calm ocean. As to the meridian in a birth chart, it is the
two-dimensional projection of a “great circle” perpendicular to the
astronomical – “rational” – horizon and passing through the points North
and South. At exact local noon the true Sun is found crossing the meridian,
but what is called Midheaven in an astrological chart is not the point
overhead – Zenith – but rather the degree of the zodiac at which the true
Sun is found at noon. The meridian is a circle of longitude passing from the
South point, through the Zenith, to the North point of the horizon.
Perpendicular to this circle, but still in the vertical dimension, we find
what is called the “prime vertical.” This too is a great circle; it passes from
the East point, through the Zenith to the West point of the horizon, and of
course it also passes through the Nadir.
These three great circles – horizon, meridian, and prime vertical – are
perpendicular to each other in three-dimensional space. Their intersections
determine six fundamental points: at the horizontal level. East, West, North,
South – and at the vertical, Zenith and Nadir. Of course we could think of
any number of points on the horizon through which great circles would pass
which would also cross the Zenith and Nadir, and North-East, North-West,
South-East, and South-West points are often referred to. Nevertheless the
concept of six directions of space – East, West, North, South, Above, and
Below – is basic.
In a two-dimensional birth chart only four basic directions are shown.
South and Zenith are somehow integrated, and likewise North and Nadir.
The reason for this, beside the two-dimensionality of the chart, is that what
the chart still considers essential is the-apparent – daily motion of the Sun.
The zodiac moves daily together with the Sun because, in our classical
western astrology, the zodiac is the “creation” of the Sun's motion – which
means, in modern astronomical terms, the Earth's orbit. And of course the
Moon and the planets go with the Sun as well.
As I said before, in archaic, locality-centered astrology, the only truly
“fixed” frame of reference was the horizon of the locality where the tribe
lived, or later where the city stood. When we reach the stage of development at which, in theory at least, the individual becomes the basic
unit – self-reliant, free, creative – then astrology, having become personcentered, should logically use as its frame of reference the threedimensional geometrical structure produced by the six directions of the
space at the center of which the individual stands. The three great circles
mentioned above-horizon, meridian, prime vertical – therefore constitute
the basic structure of an individual's space. Wherever this person goes, he
remains the center of this space. Everything that moves in the Sky – stars,
Sun, planets, comets, etc. – has its place within this space structure. The
position of any celestial body could be pinpointed and measured with
references to it.
Some celestial body, like the Sun, may be far more important than
another. It is certainly more important, for example, than a faint star moving
in a trajectory having no geometrical relation to the zodiacal belt, that is, the
plane of the ecliptic. But in a person-centered astrology there is no reason to
give a quasi-absolute value to the Sun or to the zodiac. As symbol of the
source of life energies, the Sun is essential in the same way that the heart of
a person – linked with the solar factor – is essential to the continuance of
life. If the heart ceases to beat for more than a very few minutes, the brain
becomes damaged beyond repair and the organism loses its individualized
consciousness as well as its biological existence
But while the Sun and all that refers to the zodiac may be very
important and basic, it need not be the one essential frame of reference in a
person-centered astrology. It is the three-dimensional space structure which
every individual person carries around him self wherever he goes – at least
where he stands on a solid surface – that should be considered his fixed
frame of reference.
To put it perhaps more simply: when a person travels from the Atlantic
to the Pacific coasts what he sees passing at the horizon at every step he
takes changes constantly. But the fact that he is the center of a horizon
remains unaltered. The traveler always carries his horizon with him, and a
Zenith always exists directly above his head. Stars come and go at this
Zenith point; no celestial body is “fixed,” but the Zenith is always in the
same over-head direction. Whether this or that zodiacal sign rises at Mercúrio Plutão .M.
and another at 2 A.M. does not alter the fact that the individual at both times fixes his gaze at the same eastern horizon – astrologically speakng, at
the Ascendant.
If some people find it difficult to follow such a line of thought it is
because they tend to confuse a structure with what happens at certain points
within the structure. This is an almost universal tendency, because man
reacts to an event rather than recognizing the place where the event occurs.
By “place” I mean the role this event is meant to play in the total
“structure” of the person's individual being and in the process of
actualization of his birth potential, that is, his destiny.
In simple astrological terms, if a particular celestial phenomenon – say,
a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn – has occurred in the tenth house of a
birth chart, this indicates that the conjunction of these two planets
characterizes the quality of the person's social consciousness which will
animate – and indeed which should inspire – his participation in the life and
work of his community. I say “should” because I think of a birth chart as a
“set of instructions” for the performance of the role which the individual
has to play if he is to fulfill his destiny. Call it “karma” if you wish.
To sum up: In a person-centered astrology we are dealing with two
essential factors: (1) the basic geometrical structure of the space of which
the individual person is the center, and (2) all celestial bodies which pass
through this structure in ever-varying interrelationships, or “aspects.” Each
of these bodies has different characteristics because each moves in different
ways and with different speeds and also because each appears to us with
different characteristics of size, color, and, in terms of modem astronomy,
of place in ordered series – especially the series of the planets within the
solar system.
It should be clear that the second factor includes not only the two Lights
and the planets, but also all the stars around us, for, I repeat, the stars do
move in our human experience – only they move while keeping a,
practically speaking, permanent pattern of relationship, and this is what in
the past has given them the character of being “fixed.” As to the first factor,
it refers to the houses as divisions of person-centered space. In our
traditional western astrology, however, these person-centered sections of
space are not only reduced to two dimensions, they are also considered to
exist in the zodiac, and this is where the ambiguity and confusion lie, for
there are at least two solar zodiacs, plus lunar zodiacs, and new kinds of “zodiacs” could be invented. On the other hand there is nothing ambiguous
about East, West, North, South, Zenith, Nadir. These points and the space
structure they define are universal facts of human experience and provide
us with a universally valid structural foundation for the interpretation of our
individual relationships to the universe.
At present, of course, a three-dimensional astrology using “birth
spheres” rather than birth charts is not practical, even though I believe it
will be the astrology of a more or less distant future. We have to deal with
what is available now, that is, with two-dimensional charts. Nevertheless
we can, and we should reorient our understanding of what these charts
mean, and particularly our interpretation of the houses. We should consider
these houses as strictly two-dimensional projections of the threedimensional space of which the individual is precisely the center.
Why Twelve Houses?
As, in two-dimensional charts, the basic six directions of three-dimensional
space must be reduced to four, that is, to the cross made by horizontal and
vertical, four sections of space are established; and as a person-centered
astrology deals essentially with problems looted in personal experience and
in changes in consciousness, each of these four sections should be
subdivided into three subsections, for the reason that consciousness
develops in a trinitarian dialectical mode. The concept of twelve houses
should, therefore, be retained. In a broad sense, we can speak of the
sequence of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, but as these terms are rather
ambiguous and susceptible of various interpretations, it might be more
accurate to speak of subject, object, and the relation between subject and
object, or, metaphysically, of spirit, substance and form or of action, means
for action, and the evaluation of the results of action.
All these trinities are experienced by the conscious individual in terms
of the four basic realities of human existence which correspond to the four
“angles” of the chart – Ascendant and Descendant, Zenith and Nadir. But, I
must stress again that in the traditional way western astrologers interpret
and define these angles, they do not correspond to the actual framework of the space of which an individual person is the center. The horizon of these
modern astrological charts passes through the center of the Earth, while
man lives at a point on its surface. The Mid-heaven is not the actual Zenith,
but only a point in the zodiac. Thus if a star is located on the degree of the
Mid-heaven it need not be the star just overhead at the true Zenith – and this
applies as well, of course, to the lmum Coeli, Or cusp of the fourth house,
which is not the true Nadir.
This is so, I repeat, because our astrology is Earth-centered, but not
person-centered. In practically all cases it considers only the relationship of
the Earth as a globe to the Sun, and secondarily to the planets which move
along the apparent path of the Sun. Stars and constellations have no
astrologically significant place in classical European astrology, except as a
vague remnant of an archaic tradition. Nevertheless, relatively inadequate
as our astrological charts are today in terms of a truly person-centered
approach, they have to be used; they can be used effectively if we keep in
mind the basic realities which they symbolize. Any consistent and
significantly structured set of symbols can be used if one is aware of what it
represents and the level at which it is meant to operate.
Astrology is a symbolical language – in the same way that the I Ching,
when related to its deepest metaphysical concepts, and the Tarot cards, with
their Kabbalistic background, constitute such a language. All these sets
“work” if used properly. They work In terms of the relationship between the
interpreter and the inquirer, For it is only the character of this relationship,
and the levels at which the minds of both persons operate, that adequately
define the manner in which the whole set of symbols is to be interpreted.
Religion and science should be understood humanistically in the same
way. Does Christianity as a set of great images and potentially egotransforming symbols “work”? Certainly, but it works destructively as well
as constructively. Science has its destructive side as well – witness the
pollution and destruction of natural elements, and the depersonalization and
monstrous proliferation of human beings in blighted cities. Of course one
can explain away the negative results, and place the blame on human
nature. The value of any symbol is derived from the way it is used, which
often means from the way it inevitably will be used by human beings,
considering the particular stage of their present evolution. But even an
obviously destructive use can eventually have constructive results. In the hands of a holy man the most specious and normally unwarranted means
can produce spiritual changes, while in the hands of the criminal or the fool,
they may lead to destruction or elemental bondage.
This is true of the methods used today in astrology. Nevertheless, we are
at a turning point in the history of civilization. Friedrich Nietzsche, the
tragic nineteenth-century poet and philosopher, proclaimed the need for a
“revaluation of all values.” Such a need is today far more universally
imperative than it was a hundred years ago. It is imperative in all fields of
human thinking, in all the codified and traditional feeling-responses which
come under the name of morality – especially social morality – and in all
interpersonal as well as inter-group behavior. I have spoken elsewhere of
the need for a change at all levels from an “atomistic” to a “holistic”
approach to reality4. The change which I am now outlining in terms of the
concept of astrological houses is part of this great “revaluation of all
values.”
Such a change may seem relatively insignificant, as in most cases it
does not change too radically the meaning attributed to each house of a
birth chart. Yet it can and should be considered symbolic of what is taking
place in all fields of human endeavor, because it refers to the relationship
between the individual person and the universe as a whole; that is to say, it
implies a fundamental revaluation of the meaning of this relationship. In
this sense, it constitutes a most deeply “religious” transformation. It
parallels the difference between the attitude of devotees of any organized
religion – with its hierarchy of priestly intermediaries between creature and
Creator – and the attitude of the practical mystic relating himself without
intermediaries to the wholeness of existence.
In simpler astrological terms, the factor of “position in the zodiac” as
understood today is an intermediary factor between the planet and the
individual. Jupiter, as symbol of a basic function in the human personality –
expansion and assimilation, social fellowship and prestige or wealth, etc. –
always remains Jupiter in any zodiacal sign. What it is essential to know is
the field of experience in which that function operates most significantly in
terms of the fulfillment of the individuality and the destiny of a particular
person. It is essential if we consider the birth chart – or any other chart at
different levels – as a celestial “set of instructions.” If, for instance, I have Jupiter in my natal seventh house I should seek expansion, and any other
Jupiterian result, in terms of my relationship with associates and partners, at
whatever level it may be. The seventh house refers to relationships and
partnerships of all types, and partners include not only one's “mate” but also
one's enemies, for both constitute or lead to an often necessary polarization
of values.
The modern astrologer may agree with this up to a point; yet the first
thing he usually seeks to know is the so-called “strength” of the planet in
terms of its zodiacal position. He still believes, consciously or
semiconsciously, that a planet focuses the energies that flow from a zodiacal
sign or constellation and that these “energies” are what really make
astrology work. That there are solar, planetary, and cosmic energies through
space and that the Earth as a whole is affected by them is evident. But this
really has nothing to do with astrology as it is practiced today with
reference to the life and personality of an individual. Someday, no doubt, a
science will emerge based on the study of these energies – it may possibly
be named “cosmecology” – but it will not deal with the individual person. It
will no more be astrology than Medieval or Asiatic alchemy is modem
chemistry.
I believe that Cyril Fagan did a valuable job in defining astrological
concepts in terms of an archaic, locality-centered astrology. But we are
living neither in archaic times, nor in the European Renaissance. We are
living in a psychological century in a time of total revolution and,
hopefully, at the threshold of a new age in which individuals will be able to
encounter openly the universe and all experience without intermediaries
forcing social, religious, or ethical categories upon them. Utopia? Perhaps,
but all new steps man takes are based on a vision which seems Utopian to
the old and the settled. All new ages begin in confusion and uncertainty. A
few individuals may be the pure mountain source of the new stream. Their
minds and feelings may shine with clear, limpid, unadulterated liquidity;
but they are but the very few. The ideals they live by or only envision in
great moments of illumination act upon the masses as a powerful ferment,
and where they act there is chaos. Today almost everything is indeed in a
chaotic state – and astrology is no exception. Systems of House Division
The method used in modem astrology to determine the cusps of the twelve
houses is particularly chaotic. Literally speaking, the term cusp refers to the
beginning of an area of space or a period of time. Yet some contemporary
astrologers think that the term should apply to the middle of a house. Cyril
Fagan also came to such a conclusion, but he was clear-minded enough to
suggest in the system he advocated the term should be replaced by
“median.” What often causes an astrologer to think of the cusp as the
middle section of a house is the belief that the characteristics of a house are
found most explicitly and effectively after a planet has reached the middle
of this house.
Two concepts are involved here. The first, a very basic one, refers to the
very nature of astrology. Marc Edmund Jones long ago defined astrology as
“the science of all beginnings.” In a metaphysical sense, this means that an
astrological chart can be considered the archetypal or “seed” formula
establishing the set of potentialities released in the first act of manifestation
– in the creative Fiat, the Word-in-the-beginning – which is the origin of
any existential cycle. What astrology studies is therefore the point of origin
and, revealed in it, the archetypal form of a particular beginning of life or,
in general, of any significant and originating event out of which flows a
particular series of developments. If this is the case, then every astrological
factor should likewise be related to the beginning of some series of events
or of a particular phase of development. This applies to the first degree of a
zodiacal sign, and of a house, as well as to the conjunction of two planets
marking the beginning of their cyclic relationship. It is in the first moment
of any cycle that the archetypal character of this cycle is revealed to the
astrologer.
The other concept, related to the first, is that if the most characteristic
moment in a house is its middle point, this implies that the house is
conceived in terms of time, rather than of space. The astrologer may feel
that it takes some time for someone who starts a process to fully realize and
be identified with the characteristics of that process. But again this would
be true only in terms of existential results and not of archetypal formative
causes. As I see it, astrology deals essentially with formative causes; or better still, with sets of potentialities being released, then only and
secondarily with external occurrences. This is true at any rate of what I call
person-centered and humanistic astrology. In this case the houses can be
said to represent areas of person-centered space through which celestial
bodies move. These celestial motions, of course, constitute a time factor;
but what is archetypal and formative is the spatial field through which the
motion takes place. In the same way, while the planets are in constant
motion through days and years, what natal charts most importantly reveal is
not the motion of each planet, but the pattern all these planets make at the
beginning of an individual's life, that is, the moment of the first breath. The
motions are “existential”; the overall planetary pattern is “archetypal.” It
establishes the structural form of individuality and destiny.
The most important cusps of the houses are the four angles – Ascendant,
Descendant, Zenith, Nadir. These angles begin the four sectors of the
modem two-dimensional chart. The essential formative factors operate at
these four points. The horizon clearly defines the separation between above
and below, the visible and the invisible; it cannot be the middle of
something. It is only when the astrologer thinks of it first of all as the rising
motion of the Sun, that he can broaden the concept of horizon to include the
period of dawn. The spatial concept of horizon is that of a clean-cut line of
demarcation; the Sun is crossing it, just as a runner in a race crosses the
start and finish lines.
The ambiguity related to the mixture of concepts of time and space can
be seen through the entire field of astrology. It is particularly evident when
one approaches the problem of how to determine the longitude of the house
cusps. Numerous systems have been devised and used, but the most
frequently used systems all give the same degrees of the zodiac to the
horizon and meridian. Where they differ is in their calculations of the
intermediary cusps – that is, second, third, fifth, sixth house cusps and their
polar opposites. The most widely used system today is the Placidus, which
finds the cusps of the intermediary houses by dividing into three equal
segments the semi-arcs of the Sun and all zodiacally expressed factors –
that is, the time it takes for the Sun to go from the sunrise point to the noon
point. The Campanus and Regiomontanus systems divide in two different
ways the space between the horizon and the meridian. The Porphiry system divides the number of degrees separating the horizon from the meridian into
three.
There are other systems, particularly the so-called “equal houses,”
which takes only the horizon into consideration and divides the two
hemispheres created by this horizon into six houses, each of which contains
the same number of zodiacal degrees. This system is, in my opinion, totally
indefensible because it does not take into consideration the fact that both
the vertical and the horizontal axes are absolutely necessary to the
interpretation of human existence. Using only the horizon as a frame of
reference today is the equivalent of considering lying down the only
significant position for man.
The difficulty encountered by practically all these systems is that on and
above the arctic – and antarctic – circles natal charts take on a very peculiar
form, and in many cases cannot even be made, because for several months
the Sun does not rise or set. As the zodiac in traditional western astrology is
the path of the Sun, how could one place degrees of the zodiac at the cusps
of the houses above the horizon when the Sun and the planets do not rise? If
the houses are equal sections of space – not of the zodiac – around the
individual, there are always East, West, Zenith, and Nadir, and the horizon
always separates above from below; but at some times there are only stars
and no planets in the hemisphere above or below the horizon.
The archaic locality-centered astrologer who lived in semitropical or
even temperate regions did not have to face such problems. For him the Sun
rose everyday and his astrology was based on that primordial, taken-forgranted fact of experience. Today, however, the situation is different. We
have to build our astrology on a new basis, and we must take into
consideration that each hemisphere of the Earth and the polar regions must
have its own kind of astrology. At the very least we must reinterpret some
of the basic astrological factors in relation to the astronomical situations in
each of these regions.
Person-centered astrology, however, is based on primary concepts
which are valid everywhere; for at any place on the globe man is conscious
of the horizon and of the Zenith. Every baby is born at the center of his
space structure which he will carry with him wherever he goes. The only
problem, astrologically speaking, is to ascertain all that he can observe and experience, as stars and planets pass through the twelve sections of this
space structure. THE HOUSES AS FIELDS OF EXPERIENCE
Astrology is the study of the cyclic motions of celestial bodies, but such a
study would be no more than a branch of astronomy if it did not also imply
a frame of reference in relation to which these cyclic motions can be given
meaning. This frame of reference is not the same today as it was when man
lived a purely tribal, agricultural life within narrow geographical
boundaries. Today in natal astrology, or what I call person-centered
astrology, the most important frame of reference is the individual person.
Such an astrology is concerned with the special orientation of an individual
human being who is conscious of his own individuality – or at least seeking
to be conscious of this individuality and of all that it implies in terms of
relationship to the total environment. This environment, astrologically
speaking, is the entire galaxy and especially the solar system. What
astrology claims is that the orientation of an individual to this solar and
galactic environment – that is, to the “planets,” Sun and Moon included,
and to the stars – can define his orientation to his biospheric and social
environment.
A man lives both within the Earth's biosphere and within a society – that
is, a group of people, a community, and a nation which have definite racial,
cultural, and political-economic characteristics. He is primarily a biological
organism, but he is also a person whose consciousness, mind, emotions, and
behavior have been conditioned, and often rigidly determined, by the
collective values that prevail within his family and his society.
Living, in individualized human terms, means experiencing. It is to be
aware, to reflect upon what one is aware of, and to relate experience to past
experiences – whether these be personal experiences, or experiences which
society has reflected upon, recorded, and generalized into a tradition –
social, scientific, religious, ethical, cultural, etc. Strictly speaking, one can
speak of “experiences” only in terms of changes in the relationship between
an individual and his environment – outer events – or changes in the evershifting relationship between the different organic and psychic components of the total person – body, mind, feelings, “soul.” Where there is no
awareness, there is no experience. An experience requires an experiencer.
The experiencer is changed by the experience, even if, having been
aware of what occurred, he refuses to accept it within the field of
consciousness over which, in most cases, his ego has dominion. This
refusal changes the experiencer in a negative manner; and if the process of
refusal is repeated, it gives form to a complex, and perhaps eventually
neurotic or psychotic disturbance. In any case, if there is awareness of outer
or inner changes there is an experience; but this experience is most often
conditioned partly by external biological factors, partly by the intellectual
and emotional pressures of family, culture, and society. When this occurs,
the experience is not “pure'” in terms of the essential individuality of the
person. What our present-day “sensitivity training” – as well as many
ancient techniques of meditation and interpersonal relation – seeks to
produce is a purification of individual experiences. Man should learn to see,
feel, hear, touch as if all his sensations were reaching consciousness for the
first time, and as if all his responses were spontaneous, fresh, and
“innocent” because purely natural.
This quality of naturalness could refer to the biological nature of man's
instincts and emotional drives, or, equally, to the individual nature of the
person. What is “natural” for a particular person may not be at all natural
for another. In between these two levels of nature, social and moral patterns,
traditional ways of seeing, touching, meeting, responding, are in most cases
operating, confusing all existential situations and deflecting, disorienting or
even perverting the experiences. All these distorting pressures may be
related philosophically to “karma” But how do we handle this karma? How
do we clarify, purge, and reorient, first, a person's perceptions and then his
responses?
There are many ways to approach this difficult feat, and many spiritual,
occult, and mystical disciplines have been devised to such an end.
Astrology, as I think of it, presents us with another method. This method
has very little to do with the current popular use of astrology, or a similar
use in ancient Alexandria and Rome, but it was not unfamiliar to
alchemists, Rosicrucians, and other groups. What is involved in such a use
of astrology is the realization that the universe around any individual person
presents him, in symbolic terms, with the image of what he needs to orient himself adequately in terms of his own individual truth – in Hindu
philosophy, dharma – to every basic kind of experience he could have in a
lifetime. I spoke of the birth chart as a “set of instructions” given by “God”
– or the universal Principle of Harmony – to whatever is born at the
moment and place for which the chart is cast.
According to this conception, every astrological house symbolizes a
basic type of human experience. The zodiacal sign at the cusp of the house
and whatever planet may be found in this house – and in the future the
individual stars which actually fill its space – indicate the manner in which
each of these twelve basic types of experience should be met, and indeed
would be met if there were no interference, no karmic pressure to disorient,
confuse, and alter the experiencing process. The birth chart as a whole
represents the “dharma” of the individual, what he is meant to be –
provided, of course, that the chart is interpreted in a holistic, nondualistic,
and not ethical – that is, good-bad, fortunate-unfortunate – manner. Each
house of the chart symbolizes a specialized aspect of this dharma, one of
the letters of the original twelve-letter Word, logos, that is the “truth” of the
individual, that is, his spiritual – and therefore, in an individualized sense
his natural – identity as a person.
Such a dharma refers to some integral set of activities needed by the
environment in which the individual is born. A man is born as an answer to
this need. The universe – and, more specifically, the planet Earth and
mankind-as-a-whole – is, in the broad sense of the word, an organism; and
just as a white blood cell is produced and dispatched to an injured part of
the human body to fight possible infection – that is, to meet the need of that
part of the organism – so a man is born at a certain time and place to meet a
particular need of mankind. This is this man's dharma, his “truth of being,”
his essential identity. And his birth chart is the potent symbol, or mandala,
of this identity. It is his celestial Name, the “Signature” of his destiny.
As nature is prolific and cautious, several human beings may be born in
a large popular aggregation with exactly the same birth chart. They are
formed to meet the same need. As this need of their society may be
complex and may operate at several different levels, their lives may be – in
terms of outer events and results – very different. They may differ, first,
because their genetic and environ- mental-social backgrounds are different
and, second, because some may succeed in fulfilling their “instructions” while others may achieve but very partial success, or even fail utterly. This
success or failure has nothing essentially to do with the chart. What the
chart represents is a set of potentialities. Every release of potentialities,
anywhere and at any time, contains the bipolar possibility of success and
failure, of fulfillment and frustration succeeded by disintegration. Such is
the most fundamental law of existence – simply because existence implies
duality and all energies are bipolar5.
What this means in terms of a thorough grasp of the meaning of houses
is – I repeat – that every house represents a basic type of human experience.
A human being as he goes on living meets these twelve types. What he does
with them will make his life, relatively at least, a success or a failure – and
in most cases, a mixture of both. He is, in the deepest sense, free to move
along the positive or the negative path. The positions of the planets –
always now including the Sun and the Moon – do not determine his choice.
They simply indicate the type of energy he can best use in order
successfully to meet the type of experience symbolized by each house.
Neither Mars nor Saturn indicates anything that is “bad” or
“unfortunate” in terms of an individual's dharma. If Saturn is located in the
house that refers to a man's attitude toward what he owns and to the use of
his possessions, it simply means that this individual should manage what he
has carefully, conservatively, and with a keen sense of responsibility.
Whether the man could be called rich or poor according to the social
standards of his society has really, or let us say, spiritually, nothing to do
with this Saturn position, because what a person-centered astrology should
deal with is not external events or any quantitative fact, but only, or at least
essentially, with qualities of being, feeling, thinking, and behavior. The
essential fact not only psychologically speaking, but in terms of the most
fundamental evaluation of any aspect of human experience, is not what a
person does, feels, or thinks, but the quality of his actions, feelings, and
thoughts; and this quality is, of course, related to the individual's
motivation, but not necessarily his conscious motivation.
Twelve Catagories of Experience It may be asked, of course, why out of the immense variety of human
experiences we select only twelve basic categories. There are no doubt
metaphysical and “numerological” reasons for this number twelve, and I
have already mentioned some of them. The basic number is four, and it
refers to the cross of horizon and meridian in our western-style twodimensional astrological charts. The division of the circle into four sectors
and all the patterns that can be based on the fourfold principle – itself an
expression of the dualism inherent in all experience – are typical of all
mandalas.
Carl Jung has paid great attention to mandalas, because of their
worldwide use in all ancient cultures, and because they symbolize what he
calls “the process of individuation,” or of whole-making. The basic task of
man is consciously to become a whole being at all levels of his existence;
and he can become whole only by referring all his experiences to a common
center, which is also projected as the 'circumference of his total person. In
other words, he must consciously realize the place which each experience
occupies within the total person.
In this process of becoming whole, two factors stand out: consciousness
and power. All human experiences and values can be evaluated in terms of
consciousness and power. Without consciousness, power is subhuman in its
manifestations; without power consciousness is an abstraction, an
insubstantial essence or breath, with no existential referent. In astrology,
consciousness is seen as operating in terms of the horizontal axis of
existence; power and the capacity for integral existence is referred to the
vertical axis.
In any existential whole consciousness operates inevitably in a dualistic
mode: consciousness of self, consciousness of being related to others.
Selfhood and relatedness are the two fundamental terms in all existential
realities, but there are several levels of selfhood, and relationships also
operate at various levels, exteriorizing different qualities of being.
Power also operates in a dualistic mode: the power to stand as a self, to
fully manifest the inherent potentialities of one's individual being, to
become whole in concreteness of existence; and the power to answer the
need of one's environment, group, or society, that is, to fulfill one's dharma,
one's place and function within the sphere determined by one's individual
capacities. Selfhood refers to the East point of the birth chart, the dawning point of
Light – and Light is a cosmic expression as well as the substratum of
consciousness in its existential aspect. Relatedness belongs to the West
point of the horizon – the symbolic coming-together of human beings for
the purpose of reflecting upon shared experience.
Power in terms of personal integration is represented by the Nadir of
the chart, which in modern astrological charts is approximated by the cusp
of the fourth house – lmum Coeli. Power in terms of social and communal
integration is represented by the Zenith, which in modern astrology is
approximated by the Noon-point or Mid-heaven.
According to Carl Jung, man has four basic functions: intuition,
sensation, feeling, and thinking. Intuition is related to the astrological
Ascendant – the symbolical sunrise – because intuition is consciousness,
aware of itself operating. In the opposite direction, sensation establishes a
person's relationship to other entities surrounding him; we therefore refer it
to the Descendant or cusp of the seventh house. Feeling, is obviously
symbolized by the Nadir point, because feeling is the most immediate
manifestation of the response of an integrated organism to whatever he
experiences as a change of state. At first, it is a change of internal
biopsychic condition; later on it refers to variations in the attitude, or mood,
one presents to experiences which alter one's basic sense of selfhood, of
security, and of power as a person. Thinking, is a process based on words
and syntax, which in turn are symbolical expressions of a particular culture
and social form of human togetherness. It is thus represented by the Zenith
– or in modem charts Mid-heaven – because at this point man becomes
conscious of experiencing within a communal setup.
The chart as a whole is divided by the horizon into two halves – or
hemispheres in two-dimensional projection. The below-the-horizon half can
be said to be characterized by the key words TO BE; the above-the-horizon
half, by TO FUNCTION.
To be a conscious self implies discovering oneself as the “subject” of
existence and, gradually, to realize one's powers, to express them and
eventually to increase, reform, or transform them. In the below-the-horizon
realm a person essentially thinks, acts, and feels subjectively; he exists in a
world centered around himself, and his approach to experiences is oriented toward self-realization and self-expression – and also of course toward
dealing with the results of these subjectively valued activities.
In the above-the-horizon realm relationship is the keynote; thus
partnership and the results of cooperation and/or sharing are stressed. The
keynote is participation – participation in a process in which at least two
and eventually many more people are involved. “Functioning” exists when
there is an awareness of being part of a whole – of having a particular place
in an organized and structured process, whether it be organic in the
biological sense, or social-political-cultural.
In every hemisphere two basic points are to be considered: the horizoncreated and the meridian-created “angles.” The Ascendant refers to the
original creative impulse which exteriorizes an archetypal form, a creative
Word. This impulse has to be “incarnated” in a concrete substantial
organism. A stable and integral condition of being has to be reached
through which the individual being can use “power” – that is, biological and
psychic energies – not only consciously but effectively. And this refers to
the Nadir and the fourth house.
Thus we might say that what was a release of potentiality at the
Ascendant becomes actualized in a subjective and strictly person-centered
sense in the fourth house. This process of concretization occurs in three
stages. Each of the first three “houses represents a type of experience
which, if successfully met, will bring the process to a point of culmination.
These three phases repeat themselves in terms of each angle, and thus
manifest the astrological sequence of angular, succeedent, and cadent
houses. The first, fourth, seventh, and tenth houses are angular, because
they represent the creation or exteriorization of the meaning of each of the
four angles. The second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh houses are succeedent,
and the others, cadent
One can define the basic character of these three categories of houses by
using the following key words:
Angular houses: to be
Succeedent houses: to use
Cadent houses: to understand or transform Thus the first house refers to the subjective discovery of being, or
individual selfhood. The second house refers to the use of what the
individual being finds available in order to exteriorize itself, in the broadest
sense, one's possessions at birth, including all innate capacities of body and
psyche. The third house is the field of experience that brings to us an
understanding of the relationship between being and using, between the
subjective sense of self and the objective reality of the means for action,
that is, the possessions of the self.
When we start from the Nadir, we start with “to be” – a stable, more or
less well-integrated personality, operating from some kind of “home” or
root foundation of organic existence. This refers to the type of experience
represented by the fourth house – angular. The fifth house – succeedent –
symbolizes those experiences which allow a person to use the biopsychic
energies generated by any stabilized organized whole. The sixth house –
cadent – is the field of experience which enables him to understand the
results to this self-exteriorizing use of energy, to cope with negative results,
to improve his technique of action and transform his motives.
We shall see in a moment how the key words for the three categories of
houses work out in the above-the-horizon realm dealing with functioning in
terms of human relationships and with participation in the activities of a
greater wholes group, a society, a nation. But as we survey the first six
houses – below-the-horizon realm – we can see a broader pattern emerging,
which will also repeat itself in the sequence of houses above the horizon.
Six basic operations can be defined which, below the horizon, refer to the
subjective consciousness of self. Above the horizon, these same basic
operations refer to the development of the kind of consciousness which
results from relationship, cooperation, and finding one's place in society.
These six operations can be defined as: being, having, informing,
maintaining, expressing, and transforming.
The experience of “being” in the first house leads to and becomes
substantiated by that of “having” – having a body, having possessions,
having talent, or, negatively, lacking these in any satisfying sense. In the
third house, a process of giving form through selection, classification,
organization goes on. This means adjusting to one's environment, relating
sensation to sensation, developing cunning and intellect, and formulating
and communicating one's responses to one's environment. The fourth house refers to everything that maintains the individual
characteristics of the self in a stable form; the fifth house to any experience
through which the personal self seeks to exteriorize its power; the sixth, to
experiences which impel one to transform, reform, or broaden the
consciousness of self – or in most cases, only of “ego” – thus to personal
crises at all levels and dealing with possible solutions to personal problems.
The same kind of sequence can be seen operating in the above-thehorizon realm of experience, of which the Descendant – seventh house cusp
– is the archetypal point of origin. The seventh house refers to the “being”
of relationships, that is, to the quality of our approach to relationships –
how we med: the world, and particularly “the Other,” whether it be partner
or companion – and above all, how we should learn to meet and work with
others regardless of how our society, religion, and culture have been trying
to condition us by collectively held images, ideals, and taboos. The eighth
house refers to the use to which we put the energies born of togetherness –
that is, of possessions held in common – which obviously must take into
consideration the collective rules of business, investment, transfer of
possessions, etc. Such a use, under certain circumstances, can imply a
regeneration of self-centered activities, a transformation of “self-image” –
especially whenever a conflict occurs between this self-image and the
“image of relationship” – what Carl Jung describes as the anima in a man's
life, and the animus for a woman.
The ninth house is very specifically the field of experiences which
induces in us a deeper understanding and a greater expansion of
consciousness. These experiences give form to our appreciation and
evaluation of social and cosmic processes. They deal with our attempts to
generalize and communicate, no longer personal and environmental issues
and concerns, but what affects all men and the universe as a whole. And as
the Mid-heaven is reached, we are shown the most fruitful way to
“achieve,” to bring matters of communal importance to a head, to fulfill our
individual selves through participation in the work of the world.
The eleventh house suggests the best way to put to use, and enjoy, what
we have achieved, to express ourselves as members of a community rather
than as individuals – and also to imagine better modes of togetherness, new
forms of business or social organization. Then the twelfth house ends the
cyclic process of experience essentially in one of two ways: it can mean a fulfillment in under- standing and wisdom of the inner life, which reaches
toward the emptying of life contents, that is, “death” in the symbolic sense,
which in turn leads to the beginning of a new and higher phase – or on the
other hand, it may lead to a disruption of all relationships and a tragic sense
of failure which prolongs itself beyond the cycle's end into ghostly
unresolved memories.
And then the cycle begins again.
How to Use the Houses
Every new experience is a challenge to the individual's ability to be himself,
to stabilize his personality, to assimilate what will make him grow and
mature so he can best participate in his community and more generally still,
in the evolution of mankind. He is challenged and tested by the experience.
He has to discover his individual truth of being and to develop all his innate
capacities through the experience, accepting it fully and being ready to
assume the responsibility for its fruits, while at the same time being as
much as possible “free from attachment to these fruits” – as Krishna enjoins
his disciples to be in the Bhagavad-Gita.
The first great experience is, of course, birth, but every experience can
be approached and met as a new birth. Really to live is an act of unceasing
rebirth. The problem for every person who seeks really to live as an
individual, and not merely as a replica of some social, moral, or religious
prototype, is how best to approach these ever-renewed rebirths – how to
meet every type of experience in what the existentialist philosopher calls an
“authentic” manner or, in Hindu terms, how to fulfill his dharma. As a man
fulfills his dharma he neutralizes an ancient karma and he answers the
human need that called him into being.
To the humanistic astrologer who accepts the fundamental attitude I
have outlined here and in all my writings, astrology is a means to this end
of individual fulfillment. The birth chart, and other kinds of astrological
charts that refer to the beginnings of cycles of existence, small or large, are
to be used in terms of this end. They are “instructions” that formulate in a celestial code the best means to reach the fulfillment of one's dharma
through authentic responses to every basic individual experience.
Every person will try to decipher this code according to what-ever
knowledge or capacity for intuitive illumination he has acquired. He should
do the deciphering by himself and for himself. But since we usually live in
confused or oppressive social conditions, and our psyches are filled with
conflicts and doubts, we often need or want to consult an interpreter adept
at deciphering the celestial symbols. Still, it is our own life, our own past,
and our own dharma – and we should strive to do the interpreting for
ourselves, for every interpretation is itself, potentially at least, a rebirth in
understanding which may open up a new phase in the total cycle of
unfolding our consciousness.
An individual's birth chart tells him how he can best fulfill his destiny.
Of course, the study of and meditating on one's birth chart is not the only
way to achieve this understanding. There are many other possible
approaches, but astrology has great universal validity when approached in
the right spirit. Everything in a chart refers to the best way of meeting life's
experiences in an authentic manner. And the houses constitute the basic
frame of reference in terms of which we should interpret the celestial
instructions.
As I stated above, there are many systems of house determination,
especially where the cusps of the intermediate houses, that is, those between
horizon and meridian, are concerned. This obviously generates a great deal
of ambiguity and confusion, and there is no way at present to solve the
problem in a completely satisfactory manner. Perhaps this is what should be
in terms of our highly individualistic society, for it suggests to us that there
are today alternatives for everything, that no truth is “absolute.” and that
we have to learn what we can and then forget it, allowing the intuition – or
the God within or the Inner Guide – to show us the most significant
alternative for us as individuals, here and now.
Some astrologers seek to escape the ambiguity by ignoring the houses
completely and relying solely on the planets. But a similar ambiguity exists,
as we have seen, concerning which of two or more zodiacs is the best, and
if one relies only on the angular relationship between the planets and
devises various systems in order to refine ad infinitum the analysis of such an over-all pattern of planetary relationships, it is possible to evade the most
basic issue: Who am I?, which is not the same as: What am I?
The what refers to the pattern of the entire solar system as seen from the
birth locality, because this what deals with the particular organization of the
basic life functions and psychic drives within the person, that is, the way in
which life energies operate in a particular person. On the other hand, the
who refers to the cross of the horizontal and vertical lines in our modern
charts, since it is this cross that defines the particular orientation of the
individual to the universe around him. If we thought of stars instead of
degrees of the zodiac, this who would be symbolized by a star rising exactly
at the East point, and one culminating at the Zenith exactly at the moment
the air hits the lungs of the newborn. The stars at the West point and at the
Nadir would reveal the complementary polar aspect of this essential who.
Today astrology is still basically zodiac-centered, and the Sun factor
still dominates its popular aspect. We have to deal with what is available,
just as a pianist has to deal with the equal-temperament twelvefold western
scale system if he is to play, compose or improvise on a piano. A new sense
of tone is slowly developing within music, however, and is giving birth to
new instruments and a new approach to combinations of sounds. The same
thing is happening in astrology. There are astrological “classicists” who
worship seventeenth-century models, just as there are musicians who swear
by baroque music. Some astrologers, as well as some musicians, however,
are looking toward the future rather than the past – toward the individual
person rather than the tradition-bound “silent majority.” One must always
decide where one belongs.
In other words, if we want to use the astrological material available
today – because we really have to! – we have to determine the character of
the houses by the zodiacal sign and degree at their cusps. We can also
consider the “planetary ruler” of the zodiacal sign at the cusp and, of
course, whatever planet may be located in the house.
The sign at the cusp refers to the kinds of experiences that can best
enable the individual to actualize his birth potential within the realm
structurally defined by the house being considered. If we see that
Sagittarius is at the cusp of the first house, that is, the Ascendant, we can
deduce that the individual's search for “being” will be most successful in
terms of experiences involving Sagittarian characteristics – expansiveness, broad understanding, social consciousness, the study of general principles,
teaching, perhaps traveling, perhaps religious pursuits, etc. If Sagittarius
were at the cusp of the second house, the Sagittarian characteristics would
apply to “having” – that is, to possessions and their use.
In the case of a Sagittarian cusp, Jupiter is the “ruler” of a house. The
ruling planet of the house refers to the type of energies most needed to
meet successfully the type of experience related to the house.
When a planet is located in a house, this indicates that the function
represented by the planet finds its best area of manifestation in the field of
experiences referring to this house. Conversely, if this type of experience is
to be met successfully, the kind of functional activity represented by the
planets will be most effective.
Again let me stress that, according to this new person-centered
approach, there are no “bad” or “good” planets. Every planet represents
valuable and necessary types of life-energy and functional activity. Mars
and Saturn are just as good and fortunate as Venus and Jupiter. And the
same applies to interplanetary aspects, which are no longer to be thought of
as “fortunate” and “unfortunate,” but rather – to use a now current
terminology – “soft” and “hard,” or, as I would say, form-building and
energy-releasing.
This, then, is how a humanistic astrologer approaches the interpretation
of the houses. In the next part of this volume, I will discuss the meaning of
each of the twelve houses more specifically. In concluding this section, I
should perhaps emphasize even more strongly a point stated above.
Astrology is a language. It uses symbols, and these symbols have to be
decoded and interpreted. No system of interpretation is absolutely “true” –
no more than any theory of science, or any system of social morality is
absolutely “true” Everything depends for its validity on the time, the place,
and the person, or the integrated and stable group personality. In fulfilling
his destiny to the best of his possibilities a person has to use what his
environment and his culture, including the language he speaks, offer him at
the time. He may change his environment, but essentially he cannot change
the time and place of his birth – that is, his archetypal structure of being.
This structure is his own “truth,” everything should be referred to it, not
self-centeredly, but in terms of conscious and effectual participation in
some greater whole. We can effectively participate in a whole only if we are willing to accept
at least some of its means of expression and forms of thinking and knowing.
Thus, if we are to operate in the western world today in terms of astrology,
there are things we must accept. They are there to be used. We must use
them as they seem to us, at any time, to best meet the special requirements
of our life philosophy and the needs of people with whom we want to
communicate.
Thus, if we believe in the validity of a house system and a particular
zodiac, it is these we should use – and use them as consistently as possible.
We are familiar with them. We identify our mind processes and feeling
responses with them. And, if we do this honestly and logically in terms of
whatever situation we meet, or of whatever people demand of us, we will be
successful. It will “work.”
Science and technology “work” because mankind, under the ruthless
and aggressive leadership of western races, has needed the kind of results
they provide in terms of expansion, comfort, environmental mastery, ego
pride, etc. These results are dear to us, and we have achieved great things
with them. We are now coming to realize, however, that such results may
have very negative aspects, and may actually destroy us all. Many of us,
young people especially, have recognized these negative aspects and are
reacting strongly against this civilization into which we have been born.
Yet, even as we try to envision a new world, we still have to use the means
available to us in working toward its conception and birth.
This is always the case. No man is born alone and without a past. All he
can do is to repolarize this past, first within his own nature, then in his
environment. No man can transform a culture without being informed of
its contents; he cannot affect something within which he does not, in some
manner, participate. PART TWO THE FIRST HOUSE
Breathing as the First Act of Individual Existence
Experiencing Individuality as Isolation or as Distinctness
Ascendant Sign: A Lens through which the Divine Acts
In terms of a person centered approach to astrology, the act of breathing
defines the first moment of individualized existence. At the moment of the
first breath a valve in the heart closes, blood rushes into the lungs, and the
two essential living rhythms of the human organism, the rhythm of the
blood and that of the breathing, are established in a particular way. A third
rhythm, of which we know hardly anything, may also be initiated, which
refers to pulsations of die cerebrospinal fluid, itself related to
electromagnetic – “etheric” – currents.
The identification of “life” with the breath is as old as human thinking.
The Sanskrit terms prana and atman refer, at two different levels, to the
breath. So do the Greek word pneuma, which signifies both breath and
spirit, and the Latin word anima, meaning soul. In a still broader sense,
existence itself implies motion, dynamism, rhythmic change.
In the biblical book of Genesis all existence is said to begin with God's
command “Let there be Light.” But this Light is not the Sun's light, as can
be seen from succeeding biblical statements. It is motion, vibration, and
therefore rhythm. The unborn foetus experiences rhythms, but this
experience takes place within a closed environment dominated by the
rhythms of the mother. It is only as the human organism emerges into the
open environment of the universe that he can begin to operate actively and
positively as an “individual person.” To be born as a potential individual
person is to breathe. It is for this reason that the yogi who aspires to merge his individuality with the universal Whole practices pranayama – literally,
death of the breath. He willfully disindividualizes and depersonalizes his
total being, or at least his consciousness.
Breathing is therefore the first act of independent existence within the
open environment of the universe. It is the first assertion of being. The first
house of a birth chart begins with the Ascendant, the symbol of sunrise, of
the beginning of activity on our planet, and in general of all beginnings.
Every experience can be a new beginning. Every individual can be reborn at
any moment. He can relate himself to his universe in a new way, a unique
way – his own way. This way constitutes, or at least manifests existentially,
his identity – which also means the manner in which he is oriented to the
universe.
What I mean here by universe is simply existence as this individual
person is able to see, feel, know, experience it. We can speak of this
universe on three main levels. Man is born within the Earth's biosphere –
first level. He is also born within the solar system – second level. He can
relate himself consciously to and participate in the activity of the galaxy, of
which the solar system is only a small part – third level. Beyond the galaxy
one can picture either a finite Einsteinian universe or infinite Space, and
there is probably some truth to both concepts. For any realistic and
experiential purpose, however, one should stop with the galaxy – and
indeed it is always valid to know where and when to stop in one's
intellectual speculations, lest one loses one's consciousness in an ocean of
pure nondifferentiation and existentially empty abstractions.
These three levels – the Earth's biosphere, the solar system and the
galaxy – are very real, at least potentially. They are capable of being
experienced by us and, therefore, they can be used as symbols of a threelevel process of development of the individual self. This development takes
place theoretically in three phases, when it takes place at all, in terms of
human experience and of the growth of the type of consciousness which can
be formulated and translated into action. This three-level process can also
be referred, at least in an archetypal sense, to the three basic periods of a
human life individually and consciously fulfilled: from birth to age 28; from
28 to 56; from 56 to 84· The 84-year cycle is that of Uranus' revolution
around the Sun and, as Uranus is essentially the symbol of transformation
and metamorphosis, this cycle refers to man operating at the level at which constant transformations are possible. On the other hand, the traditional 70year cycle of existence – three score and ten – refers to a human life
dominated by biological and socio-cultural traditions, and by the 20-year
cycles of the Jupiter-Saturn relationship, and it should be obvious that the
majority of human beings are still operating at that level of existence and
consciousness.
The number 28 has been considered “the number of man.” It relates Júpiter and 7, and thus represents the full concrete workings of the 7-year cycle, Júpiter being the symbol of concreteness. Three 84-year cycles contain twelve 7year periods, and bring this 7-year cycle to potentially full cosmic
manifestation. In a more occult sense this 84-year cycle refers to the
building of the immortal Christ Body, or in Buddhistic terminology the
Diamond Body, the product of the “Marriage of Heaven and Earth.”6
I shall return in a later chapter to these cycles, for what concerns us here
is the fact that the experiences to which each of the twelve houses refer can
be met, at least potentially, and given meaning at three fundamental levels.
An individual can be born and reborn at each of these levels. Likewise, he
can experience and deal with what he owns in terms of several sets of
values – second house – and he can correlate and think out his experiences,
as well as develop his particular approach to his environment – third house
– at three different levels as well. Then, as he seeks to find a base upon
which to build a solid and secure sense of personal activity, he can find such
a base either in the superficial relationships and traditional ways of his
family, or in the deeper levels of his collective, national culture –
symbolized by the taproots of great trees. He can also reach the symbolic
core of the Earth, which means the very center of his “global” being –
fourth house.
Returning now to the first house: A human being is born physically out
of his mother's womb. He can – yet he need not – experience
psychologically a “second birth” as an individualized person gradually
becoming more conscious of his place and function in his community. This
is his birth in individuality, while the first birth was a birth in “organicity.”
Some individuals reach the level of a third birth – a birth in Light or in
spiritual reality. If one considers this three-level birth process as a time sequence of
developments, one can then refer these to the beginnings of the three 28year cycles of conscious individualized existence – theoretically to actual
birth, to the period between ages 27½ and 29, and to that between 56 and
59. But one can also think of these three levels of birth as without time
referents for, potentially at least, the three levels are there all the time; man
can function at each level and all levels if his consciousness somehow can
attune itself to the vibratory rates of these levels and become aware of their
specific horizons. Every man is living at the same time in the biosphere, in
the solar field, and in the galactic universe, but few men are really
conscious of all that this implies.
The first house of a person's birth chart indicates essentially the type of
experience through which he will best discover who he is as a unique
individual. He can make such a discovery at three basic levels of
awareness, which may be called instinctual, mental-cultural, and spiritualcosmic. These levels can be reached in an active, dynamic state of
consciousness or reflectively and passively. Indeed, every astrological
indication can always be interpreted positively or negatively, which here
means reflectively. The first house and its origin or cusp, the Ascendant,
indicates how the reaching can be done more effectively and significantly,
in order best to release an individual's set of potentialities characterizing a
particular person. Later on we shall see how one can interpret the presence
of every zodiacal sign and every planet in the first house.
I spoke in the preceding paragraph of levels of awareness. Every
experience can be seen as a test in self-awareness as well as a test in one's
readiness and willingness to be born again. Most human beings, however –
implicitly if not explicitly – refuse to be born again. A person may close his
mental-spiritual eyes to the potential meaning of an experience – that is, to
what it may bring that would impel him to perform an act of self-delivery.
Hindu philosophy speaks constantly of liberation or deliverance from the
maya of desires rooted in the basic “ignorance” of the human condition. But
what is essential is not liberation so much as the bringing-to-birth of a new
form of consciousness, a new mode of existence at a new level.
Every deeply and totally lived experience can arouse in the individual a
will to rebirth and transformation or transcendence, yet certain types of
experiences are more adequate, significant, and effectual means than others in bringing this about. We must look to the first house and especially the
Ascendant to find what these may be. Natural processes of growth cannot or
rather should not be forced, but awareness does not imply willful action.
One can “watch and wait” – and, some will say, pray – without demanding
from life that the magical experience come, without impatiently yearning
for it.
The unexpected is usually the most revelatory, but one can polarize
one's consciousness to the unexpected. One can create and maintain –
which is harder! – a quality of ready expectancy – again one may speak of
it, in a broad sense, as “prayer” – which avoids the pitfall of demanding a
particular event, outer or inner, from life. What is first and foremost to be
realized, however, is that one cannot breathe a truly deep and vitalizing
breath without first emptying one's lungs and, at other levels of existence,
one's psychic being and one's consciousness.
To be empty, to become filled, to respond to the influx of whatever is
being experienced – these are three essential phases of an almost dialectical
process. But in terms of human existence we should realize that what comes
first is being full – full of unauthentic, unindividualized contents, full of the
karma of homo sapiens, of a particular race, culture, and family and, one
could add, of the unconscious vestigial remains of previous incarnations.
The newborn is filled with mother stuff; the child who comes of age is filled
with socio-cultural stuff. If he is to experience the second birth, he has to
emerge from this collective social-cultural matrix. He has to discover the
individual tone of his being, his own mantram, his celestial Name. And
now that there usually is no Initiator to give him his secret Name he has to
discover it in some deep surge of consciousness. Yet actually this celestial
Name is his birth chart.
The power of that Name, while it individualizes, also isolates. The
greater the intensity, the sharpness, the precision of the characteristics of
that Name – revealer of individual destiny – the stronger the inevitable
sense of isolation which follows the revelation. Jesus asked of his disciples,
“Be ye separatel” The Patanjali yoga aphorisms stress what has been
translated as “isolation.” In olden days the Hindu chelas were forbidden to
touch any other human being; they slept on mattresses filled with their own
breath so they would be insulated even from the soil's magnetism. Today we are operating at a different level. In old India what had to be
overcome was the deep unconscious attachment to tribe and soil, while in
this century, particularly in the United States, it is a poignant feeling of not
belonging anywhere, of non-rootedness and psychic alienation. The focus
of the new way of life is therefore total relatedness, and the ideal is life in a
commune in totally open forms of relationship. In this situation the symbol
of the Descendant – seventh house cusp – may be more validly stressed
than that of the Ascendant. Yet the real “commune” of the days to come
should be one in which individuals consciously and deliberately come
together to reach beyond their socio-cultural egos and to experience the
harmony of holistic interdependence, each being ready and willing to
perform his destiny within the whole.
The word isolation is related etymologically not only to solus, “alone,”
but to sol, “Sun.” Every Sun is isolated in space, the center of a group of
planets upon which it radiates its vitalizing energy; yet a Sun is also a star,
and as a star is one companion among many in a Brotherhood of stars in the
galaxy. This is indeed a most revealing symbol. As suns, individual persons
are, or appear to be and feel, isolated. This is the price one has to pay for
individualization – an often heavy price required for an inherently tragic
process. But to be isolated need not mean to feel lonely, and even less,
alienated.
No Sun radiates life to its planets in empty space; no individual is born
on an alien Earth. Every Sun is essentially a star in the galaxy, and every
individual is born to fulfill a function, to answer a need of mankind and of
the Earth, the one home of mankind. But in times such as ours, in order for
a man significantly to live his dharma he needs to become, at least for
awhile, separate from that section of mankind that mothered him. An old
occult saying is: “When the son leaves the mother, he becomes a father.”
The seed must leave the plant that gave it form and substance before it can
become the source of a new plant, perhaps on a distant soil upon which it
was blown by winds of destiny.
The man who has thus experienced a second birth as an individual
gradually more aware of his destiny must be, in some sense, different from
other men still huddled within the matrix of their society. Yet difference can
easily be a negative word, for many an individual tends to emphasize and to
glorify his difference from the collectivity. The injunction “Be ye separate!” is valid only as a necessary means to an end; but once achieved, this end, as
is so often the case, dismisses the means as valueless. The consciousness
can no longer validly focus its attention upon these means.
A feeling of difference breeds a sense of separativeness, of distance, of
incompatibility and perhaps fanaticism for what one has discovered. The
positive counterpart of “difference” is distinctness. To be distinct is to stand
out in the midst of a group – not because one wants to or one is proud of the
fact, but simply because while the other members of the group may operate
confusedly and in an unauthentic, unformed, uncharacteristic manner, the
distinct individual lives an authentic and formed life which reveals the
unique character of his being and his place of destiny. His life is a series of
“Signatures” with which he marks all he touches with his own genius, in
whatever area of activity he may perform his distinctive deeds.
Such a man is an origin, while the man whose great desire is to be
“original” is mainly concerned with emphasizing, perhaps beyond the limits
of taste and validity, the difference of which he is so ego-proud. The
craving for originality embalms and mummifies differences, but underneath
all differences stands the one ground of man's common humanity7.
The secret of rebirth – rebirth at the core of every experience – is to be
empty of self, yet to maintain silently and in faith a formed receptacle into
which the downpour of spirit may flow, then flow through. A source is a
place through which water, hidden in the vast expanse of the soil, flows.
Every experience can be the source of new and transforming – thus,
creative – life developments. Every experience finds itself revealed at the
Ascendant of the moment at which it happens.
To speak of the Ascendant and the first house as representing the
“personality” conceived as an evanescent and mostly illusory fact of
existence, as many theosophically inclined astrologers have done, and to
glorify the Sun in the birth chart as symbol of the “spiritual Self,” or
Individuality, is to miss the central fact of the spiritual life as it can be lived
today by individualized persons. The Ascendant is indeed the most elusive
and hard-to-know factor in a birth chart, but just because it is the most
fleeting and most individual, it is the point of manifestation of the universal
spirit – or God. God acts only through particulars. Generalities and mere
life power belong to the intermediary realms, to the level of cosmic building and formative agencies. The Divine incarnates only in the individual – He
or It overshadows the group. The supreme responsibility always lies with
the individual. At the exact moment, in the most definite manner Destiny
speaks and acts through the individual.
The first house of a birth chart refers to the area of experience within
which Destiny may speak at definite moments to impel the performance of
specific acts. What is needed in the individual person who could be such a
focusing agent for the Divine is total readiness, total openness to any and all
circumstances and demands of existence. It is perfect availability, but
availability oriented to that aspect of the world's life which, for this
particular individual, has the character of authenticity.
One can often discover what zodiacal sign was rising at birth by
studying a person's features, particularly the structure of his face and his
facial expression. The head symbolizes the essential character of the
individuality of the person as a conscious being. Everything “comes to a
head” in the face, at least in normal circumstances, for the face exteriorizes
the form of the individuality. It has been said that the eyes are the windows
of the soul, but the head is the home that the individuality has built. It
reflects the creative Word in the beginning.
The zodiacal sign on the Ascendant normally tells us much concerning
the dharma of the individual – that is, the central potentiality which the
person should seek consciously to actualize as a vessel or lens through
which the Divine may act. If there are planets in the first house they
indicate the kind or kinds of functions which will be most valuable in the
process of discovery of one's authentic being.
To be, to breathe, to begin and always and forever to begin again, to
meet and reveal the presence of God and the power of creative selfhood in
every experience, to speak with authority in terms of one's dharma: these
are words. Meditating upon these words may lead the perceptive individual
to the very source of his or her own being. THE SECOND HOUSE
Experiences of Ownership
Effective Use of One's Birth Potential
An Individual's Possessions in Relation to the Community Traditionally the second house is associated with possessions and, in
our society, to money – symbol of the capacity to own whatever a person
needs or desires. The concept of possession is, however, very complex; it
has several levels of meaning and most astrologers, unfortunately, tend to
interpret this concept and “second house matters” in a superficial, mainly
social, way. What is really at stake in the type of individual experiences that
can be related to the second house of a birth chart is the problem of
ownership, what is meant whenever an individual uses the words “mine”
and “my own.”
After most babies have learned to use a few words, they discover the
use of the word “mine.” It may happen suddenly, and for a while the very
young child, as he or she touches various objects, proclaims excitedly
“mine!” Actually, conscious existence implies a basic kind of ownership
and a rudimentary sense of possession – that is, the conception of some
material substances as being “mine.” The person who says I am has to have
a larynx and tongue to say it with. The I is but an abstraction without the
am, which implies the existence of a physical body. This body is the first
and fundamental possession of the self. It provides the means for the
gradual actualization of the potentialities inherent in the field of selfhood. It
contains within its cells and atoms an immense reservoir of potential
energy. How is this energy being used? How should it be used so that the newborn may fulfill its function in the Earth's biosphere and in mankind?
These are questions to which the second house of a birth chart ought to be
able to give some valid answers.
As I have already said, the second house is a “succeedent” house, and
the motto of this type of house is to use. The birth process impels a new
human organism into the open environment of the biosphere; whatever is
back of this impulsion has to consider how to use the powers inherent in
that organism. At the strictly biological level, life is the causal factor in the
birth – life operating according to the particular mode of operation of the
species homo sapiens and being focused through the parents. These parents
act merely as carriers of the sperm and ovum. As individual persons their
role is minimal, though it is traditionally believed that it is possible to
affect, before and during pregnancy, the type of spiritual entity which will
embody itself in the womb.
Life operates through what we call the instincts. The new organism is
“programed” to meet existential needs and emergencies in definite ways.
The instincts tell it how to use its many component parts. In animals the
programing is effective and admits of no deviation, and the more advanced
a species is along the evolutionary scale, the greater the possibility of
adjusting to radical changes in the environment, provided they are not too
radical or too sudden. In human beings this possibility is remarkably
developed. The more advanced the process of individualization is – a
process which depends on the stimulation and complexification of the
mental faculties – the greater the potential to transcend instinctual reactions.
As the mind begins to reflect upon itself – that is, to be conscious of being
conscious – the “I am” sense begins to operate in the consciousness of the
organism, polarizing or actualizing what we may think of as a transcendent
factor – a monad or Soul – or as an immanent rhythm of existence – self8.
The moment the child becomes consciously aware of being an entity
distinct from the other entities around him, he inevitably realizes that there
are some things which he can call “mine.” His consciousness soon detaches
itself sufficiently from the various organs and functions of the body to be
able to speak of “my” hands, “my” head or tummy, etc., especially when
pain is localized there. That Peter has a strong body, and Jane has a
beautiful face might be stated by parents and relatives. The child has a name, a body, a particular temperament, special abilities. These characterize
him; they are his possessions at the most personal and intimate level of
existence.
According to some thinking, these possessions are what they are
because of the genetic conditioning and ancestral past of the child. They are
his first and most basic inherited possessions. If one accepts the concept of
reincarnation of a transcendent entity, the soul, the body and all that is latent
in it – faculties, character, tendencies, innate powers of the mind,
psychological predispositions, etc. – constitute what this incarnating soul
has to deal with, what it possesses and can call “its own.” The problem for
this soul is how to use, to manage, to actualize fully, and even to enjoy
these basic possessions.
This constitutes the first level of ownership. A second level deals with
objects of possession, eventually with money, with the capacity to increase
one's possessions in order to satisfy wants, fancies, and moods, and later on
the ability to give a positive value to one's relationship with other persons
and with society as a whole. This is the social level of ownership, using the
term social in its broadest sense, which includes a child's relationship to his
family and his friends or associates. At this level acquisitiveness becomes a
driving force, in exaggerated form becoming the billionaire's greed for the
power which enormous wealth can bestow.
Everything that one comes to possess is in one way or another the result
of the activity of living organisms and social groups in the past. Every
person, in a very real sense, inherits the past of nature and of human society.
His inheritance may be small and inadequate for true self-actualization, or it
may be overwhelming in its potential scope, but it always represents the
past. The belief in reincarnation adds another dimension to this past, that is,
tendencies, faculties, and karma produced from past lives and carried over
into the present. What to do with all this past now constitutes the basic
second house question. The answer rests with the concept of management;
that is, of intelligent, effective, and successful use resulting in the best
possible actualization of one's birth potential, and therefore of one's
individuality.
The proper use of possessions leads to the revelation, exteriorization,
and fulfillment, in relation to other human beings and to one's society, of
one's individuality, that is, of who one is. A person realizes what he is by using what he owns; he demonstrates what he is to himself and to all men,
by the use of what he was given at birth along with what he comes to
acquire later on. Ideally, he should transform these possessions in terms of
his individual purpose and destiny. This, however, can hardly be achieved if
a person does not advance beyond the traditional use of possessions, for
then he acts merely as a servant of the past, as the agent of ghosts, of karma
– whether individual or social. His life, then, is lived by his ancestors, either
in terms of perpetuating the social-cultural privileges inherited from them,
or of being driven by ancient social-religious hatreds and fears.
Animal instincts are conditioned by the past experiences of the species,
and so are the responses of primitive human beings. Even more
individualized persons are programmed by traditional patterns of behavior
impressed upon them by parents and state or religion. Patterns of
possessiveness and demands for exclusive ownership are still basic in our
society. “It is mine; no one else can have it” is the great cry of our modern
individualistic and capitalist society. The great drive is the drive for profit
and wealth, and for the more intangible possessions related to prestige,
social influence, fame, and even “love.” Nearly everyone clings to some
kind of privilege – the negative aspect of ownership. It is negative because
it is based on the past, and usually on insecurity, fear, and pride. The
positive aspect of ownership, on the other hand, is the capacity to bring the
energies of Nature and the values of the past to a new level of efficacy and
fruitfulness – efficacy and fruitfulness not in terms of special privileged
individuals, groups, or social classes, but in terms of the whole of mankind.
Possessions should be used. Unused capacities or wealth – for instance,
land – are impediments to human growth, whether it be individual or
communal growth. But the individual must not identify himself with what
he owns, for then he is used by his possessions – which automatically
demand expansion – instead of his using them. The individual should
impress the rhythm of his individuality upon what he owns; he should give
an individual and not merely a collective social meaning to his possessions.
He should make his ownership significant in terms of his individual
character and destiny. He should dedicate what he has to what he is, for it is
being which alone gives meaning to having. Nothing is more futile and
spiritually empty than having without being, and this is true of all kinds of
possessing. A sound and wholesome society should establish as a basic principle: No ownership without individually significant use. What is or is
not significant must remain a personal issue, yet the community can
demand of the individual that he consciously and deliberately dedicate what
he owns to a purpose which to him is significant. The purpose to which
possessions are put alone gives them value and gives meaning to
ownership.
There is nothing sacred in the mere fact of ownership. Only an essential
unspiritual society, like our western society today and even more perhaps in
the last centuries, can glorify the fact of ownership regardless of the way
possessions are used, or of whether or not they are used. At the third level
of human existence, where spiritual and all-human values are accepted as
standards of living, all possessions are naturally and spontaneously
consecrated to the process of human evolution – which means in a narrower
sense to the welfare of the community to which these possessions are
related, for wealth arises from human cooperation, implicit or explicit as the
case may be.
To amass a fortune from some new invention, or from the discovery of
natural resources on one's land, is actually and spiritually a crime against
social harmony and communal health. A man's possessions are the direct
result of centuries of human efforts and interplay; all possessions are the
outcome of natural and social processes in -the past. The owner inherits all
he owns from the history of the biosphere and of human society. What
alone can give meaning and value to his possessions is the use he makes of
them. What is demanded of him is that this use add new value and new
creative meaning to the vast tide of Earth life and human society.
In the final analysis, the individual who lives according to spiritual
values realizes that he himself, as a living person, is the one ultimate
possession to surrender to mankind on the altar of human evolution. In this
gift, he fulfills himself by freeing himself from the possessiveness of
possessions. By owning nothing he may at last blend his being with the
great rhythms of the universe.
He lets himself be carried on by the universe, and his consciousness can
become a magic mirror on which every event acquires significance and
value. He is possessed by the universe to serve the ultimate purpose of all
existence – the revelation of Meaning.
God is the all-encompassing Meaning of all possibilities of existence. THE THIRD HOUSE
The Childhood Environment
The Development of Intelligence
The Search for Knowledge: Purposes and Limitations
When an astrological textbook speaks of the third house as that of “brothers
and sisters, and near relatives,” it actually means the earliest environment of
the newborn and of the growing child's relationship to it. Everything in this
environment affects the baby and it is in contact with it that he comes to
discover the extent of his powers and to differentiate what he is, as a living
organism endowed with a special kind of consciousness, from an outer
world. This world contains objects and perhaps animals and growing things,
as well as members of his close family. Indeed, astrological references to
members of his family – parents, siblings, relatives – belong to a type of life
which is still closely involved in tribal relationships or kinship. In a society
in which old-time family patterns lose most of their importance, more
fundamental values have to be considered, values which refer to whatever
the environment-as-a-whole presents to the growing consciousness of the
child.
The relationship of the child to his environment is basic in the formation
of his character and of his responses to life. Such a relationship exists
simply because no living organism is born in a void. It is born under the
influence of everything that fills the space around the boundaries of its
inner world, that is, around its “skin” or, we might say, around the field of
forces pervading all its organs and its cellular activities. Any organism must
first conquer its “living space.” In many cases this conquest implies a fight,
even if it is only the fight for attracting and holding the attention of the maternal provider of necessary food – and the mother's love providing a
sense of security and well-being.
Brothers and sisters may be or may appear to present obstacles to
getting this attention, and therefore they may come to be regarded as
competitors. But other people, objects, and the, to the child,
incomprehensible activity of the food-and-love provider, when away from
him, compete as well to deprive him of exclusive attention. It may not even
be the actual mother whose attention the child requires and instinctively
demands. Actual physical kinship may be much less important than is
traditionally believed, and in cases where the baby received his milk from a
wet nurse who also took complete charge of him, this kinship bond did play
a secondary role. Still, there may be a deeply unconscious instinct at work
linking the organism of a child to his close family, though undoubtedly the
importance of this instinct, if it exists, is assuredly magnified and
glamorized by all traditional cultures that give to blood relationship and to
all ideals rooted in a tribal kind of consciousness and social organization a
hallowed significance.
This instinct finds its primary field of manifestation in the fourth house,
but before it can affect the consciousness of the child, he must learn to deal
with his environment, and its impact upon him exists as a challenge. It is on
this challenge that the development of the nervous system is based, for the
nervous system of any living organism is the concrete organic manifestation
of the capacity to come to terms with the environment.
In the child this “coming to terms” is at first entirely unconscious, or at
least it is instinctual and does not demand what we call in a human sense,
consciousness. It operates originally as “sensations” and as spontaneous
muscular responses to them. The first cry of the newborn is a muscular
response to the sensation of air entering the respiratory membranes.
Gradually a definite system of connections between nerve cells is stabilized
which is the foundation for human intelligence. By intelligence I mean the
capacity to come to terms with any environment – first, physical, then also
psychic – and therefore to adjust to its ineluctable demands and eventually
to transform it as far as is possible. At its lowest level, intelligence is the
cunning of animals as well as of primitive men and children. Cunning is the
ability to play one factor in the environment against another – for instance,
when the child plays one of his parents against the other. In a sense this constitutes a “game,” and the game of life becomes
increasingly more complex and subtle as the social environment increases
in complexity – and also as man seeks to survive in environments that are
very different from his native habitat, such as on the moon's surface. Any
game implies rules, and Nature sets the rules in the normal biological game
of life. Man makes his own rules, however, in sophisticated social games,
and even in national or international politics. In order to get along, one has
to know and to understand the rules, meaning – in the biospheric
environment and the solar system – the “laws” of the universe. From the
traditional Hindu point of view the universe is the lila (play or sport) of the
Creator. Man therefore must discover the rules of the universal game set by
God. He asks God for clues by means of invocation and prayer, or by
seeking to attune his intelligence to the mind of God. God in turn kindly
rewards the seeker, and humanity at large, with various kinds of
“revelations.”
The third house, then, refers not only to the nature of the environment
and to the persons who act within it – close relatives,etc. – but to the
development of intelligence and eventually of analytical intellect and
empirical science. What differentiates this house from its opposite, the ninth
house, is that the third house refers to experience involving direct personal
contact with the close environment of the individual, while the ninth house
deals with experiences which can only take place in terms of cooperation
between human beings. Ninth house experiences imply language a cultural
background, and what Korzybski9 called the time-binding faculty in man.
Such experiences postulate a transfer of knowledge from generation to
generation. They are based on a complex and socially stabilized type of
understanding. In the third house “understanding” is still very rudimentary;
it is characteristically empirical; it pieces together personal observations,
classifies them, and fits them into a practical set of rules. These are
however, simply rules and not universal laws. The third house type of mind
generalizes as little as possible.
It is behaviorist, pragmatic, technique-oriented. It simply wants to know
the “how to” of doing things for practical reasons. It can be most inquisitive
and inventive, but also subtle and cunning in developing experiments –
witness the incredibly complex experiments devised by laboratory scientists, whether physicists or psychologists. Yet it is not philosophical
and even less metaphysical or religious. It is the mind of the specialist, not
of the generalist.
Still, in order to control or transform his environment, a man has to
formulate his findings, at least in a primitive and pragmatic-technical
manner. He learns to communicate with other men, yet this communication
refers essentially to practical goals, to how to survive, and eventually to
how to feel happy and personally fulfilled in one's environment.
We should look at the third house as an inevitable follower of the first
and second. In the first house the basic issue to be – that is, to discover what
we are and who we are, and to assert our individuality. In the second house
we discover and experience the kind of material substance – first,
biopsychic, the social-cultural and financial substance – which we own and
therefore is ours to use. In the third house we come to know how best to use
it in the environment in which it has to be used; and this knowledge can
only come to us, at this stage at least, by trying to act out what we are and
using our possessions – meaning first of all, our bodies – up to the point
where we are blocked by the resistance of surrounding objects and people.
Every child from the moment of birth instinctively tries to find out how
far he can go in any direction, physical as well as psychological, before his
gesture or action is stopped by something or someone. He learns that he is
not born in a void. He is surrounded by obstacles and opposing forces and
wills; he has to define his own “living space” and to know what is available
to satisfy his needs and what is permissible within the boundaries of his
activity.
The need for such a knowledge repeats itself at a higher level and the
adult also must learn how far he can safely go in social and intellectual
fields. Often the individual refuses to admit personal limitations or dangers
in the use of what he has come to possess; and neurosis, psychosis, or social
tragedy may be the result. Mankind today is facing such a kind of potential
tragedy because western man refuses to accept the limitations of what he
can do in and to his planetary environment. We have to learn the real extent
of our power as physical and mental human beings, and the real value of
what we possess – our technology and our affluence – and the only way to
learn may be, alas, to find out objectively what the end results of the use we
make of these possessions will be. A megalomanic self-image seeking to project itself by means of enormous powers wrenched from nature
inevitably will most likely elicit a very forceful reaction from our planetary
or cosmic environment.
We should learn fast if we want to avoid a catastrophe. Knowledge at
the level of the ninth house tends to be theoretical and very general, but
third house experiences have a character of immediacy. Survival may be at
stake. The search for knowledge in the third house field of experience is, or
should be, conditioned by the need to know in practical terms how
everything works so that the individual may more effectively demonstrate
what he essentially is. When, however, the person is driven in this search
for knowledge by socially determined goals and pressures, the knowledge
he acquires ceases to have real significance for himself as an individual. His
intellect may become bloated, filled with meaningless data which he cannot
assimilate. If he does not retrace his steps or “drop out” from the
environment which substitutes a false ideal for his true individual selfhood,
then some kind of tragedy may be unavoidable.
The third house is called, quite significantly, a cadent house because it
implies the possibility of a fall away from what is indicated in the angular
house that has come before. A cadent house can mean integration and
synthesis, or it may end in disintegration and collapse, or perversion. A
process of transformation can operate, and the experiences related to all
four cadent houses may be – and should be – preludes to reorganization in a
new realm of existence. But the process can backfire when the experiences
related to the angular houses – first, fourth, seventh, tenth – have not been
sound and wholesome, and/or the powers used in the succeedent houses –
second, fifth, eighth, eleventh – have been abused or misused. This is
particularly obvious where the sixth and twelfth houses are concerned, but
it is no less so in terms of the mental processes related to the third and ninth
houses. Our present society glamorizes knowledge, especially technology
and all “how to” types of information. With computers it has acquired the
capacity to store, correlate, and make available enormous amounts of
information.
This capacity is a third house matter. It can be a blessing or a curse,
depending on the strength and validity of the image man has of himself and
the universe. Alas, the image that western man has made at the official level
of his thinking is essentially crude and megalomanic. Unless it is fundamentally altered, a fall seems inevitable. It may not be too late to alter
it, but the time is short, extremely short. THE FOURTH HOUSE
Land, Home, and the Center of the Globe
The Experience of Depth and Inner Foundations
The Integration of the Personality
With the fourth house we reach one of the most significant, yet generally
one of the least truly understood sections of the modern astrological charts.
The reason for considering the fourth house only in its most superficial
sense – as referring to the home and to all real estate values – is that most of
us are still living on an Earth which, in our basic feeling experience,
remains flat in spite of all that our intellects profess to know to the contrary.
Astrology is still drawing a great deal of its symbolism and meanings from
a Ptolemaic conception of the world; thus it still associates the fourth house
with the idea that below the surface of the Earth there is nothing but solid
substance extending forever in depth and with no other meaning except that
it is solid and that it is a foundation upon which to build houses and from
which to raise crops and extract subsoil wealth.
The fourth house does indeed have such a meaning, but as we come not
only to know with our brains, but to feel with the whole of our personality –
body and psyche – that the Earth is a sphere and that we are living on its
curved surface, the fourth house takes on a new, much deeper meaning. It
takes on a global significance, for it not only comes to represent the
productive soil, the foundation for the home, and the Earth into which to dig
graves – the “end” of all things – but it carries the meaning, above all, of
the center of the globe. In the fourth house the person can and should reach
the experience of center – the center of his own global, total personality as
well as the center of global humanity, of a firmly established and concretely real brotherhood of man. Without such an experience of center, an
individual can never demonstrate in its fullness his human stature. He
remains a creature of the flat layer of productive soil which constitutes the
surface of the Earth, whether he roams upon it like a superior animal or
settles in rigid vegetable rootedness to a particular spot called “my home”
or “my country.”
The fourth house, then, can be said to have two basic meanings
according to the level at which a man's consciousness operates. In a primary
and biological-psychic sense, it refers to the soil in which the “man-plant”
(a term used in ancient esoteric traditions) is rooted. The cusp of the fourth
house is the point of deepest sustainment and most secure foundation for
the building of anything that is to rise above the ground. Thus it refers to
the ancestral tradition and the great images and symbols on which a culture
is built – Spengler's “prime symbols” and Jung's “archetypes of the
collective unconscious” – indeed, to all that a person takes for granted as
evident truths, including the postulates of science and its constants.
In order to emerge successfully from the matrix of his particular culture
and religious-ethical tradition a human being needs a deeper and more
individualized type of sustainment. Symbolically speaking, his taproot
reaches to the center of the globe. Individuality can only be experienced as
centeredness in self, and by self I do not mean a transcendent, all-inclusive
principle, but rather a rhythmic power that resides at the very center of
concrete existence. That power has been represented as residing in the
“heart,” because the heartbeats constitute the most fundamental rhythm of
the living organism. In Rosicrucian symbolism this center is pictured as the
Rose that blooms at the center of the Cross – a cross formed in the human
body by the vertical line of the spine and the horizontal line of the extended
arms.
In such a center, wherever it is exactly located, the Hindu mystic and
yogi felt and saw the presence of atman, the center of all reality. In the
Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna, the incarnate Deity, says: “There dwelleth in the
heart of every creature, the Master, Ishvara, who by his magic power
causeth all filings and creatures to revolve mounted upon the universal
wheel of time. Take sanctuary with him alone, with all thy soul; by his
grace thou shall obtain supreme happiness, the eternal place . . .” (William Sol . Judge's translation). It is indeed in the symbolic Nadir – which is also the Midnight point of
the consciousness – that the “God-experience” can be had. There dwells the
immanent God, the God-in-the-depths who polarizes the splendor of Godin-the-heights, the flamboyant noon-God whose face cannot be seen
without blinding the onlooker. Every truly individualized person “knows”
by an intimate existential and irreductible knowing that there can be no
secure foundation except when he has reached a state of unshakable
centeredness. Until this state is experienced a human being remains bound
to some kind of matrix. It may no longer be the actual mother or substitute
Mother-image; but the cultural tradition, the organized Church, or even the
Party for old-time Communists, can remain an enveloping psychic or
ideological womb. All “solid” foundations may crumble, the tree firmly
rooted may be felled, but the globe forever retains its center. “Global man”
is secure in the centeredness of his individualized selfhood.
One can carry one step further the symbolism of the taproot able to
reach the center of the earth. The vertical line of the birth chart (Zenith-toNadir) points to the Sky as seen at the antipodes. If all men stood erect on
the surface of the Earth, the downward prolonged line of their spinal
columns would meet at the center of the globe and, going farther, reach the
antipodes. By looking exactly above to the Sky every man contacts a
different star. The heads of men are directed to different points of the Sky;
their feet are oriented to the center where all earthly things are one. Unity is
at the center of the Earth, not in the Sky. Man's common humanity is
experienced in the depths; it is the head functions which differentiate and
divide.
This is why what is called depth psychology is so significant today, in
our era of individualization based on the superficial pseudo-center of
consciousness and desire that we call the ego. Depth psychology uses the
concept and the experience of depth to reach the center. When a human
being reaches his own center he also discovers that he is one with all other
human beings, for all things converge at the center. In Masonic tradition this
is referred to symbolically as meditating on the Midnight Sun, for at
midnight the Sun is at the cusp of the fourth house, illumining the
antipodes. The individual realizes what he is by uniting with his opposite,
and philosophers have often spoken, in an abstract sense, of the
reconciliation of opposites. Every value and quality can be defined by reference to what it is not. The concept of good rests on that of evil. The
famous Shakespearean phrase “To be, or not to be: that is the question” is a
typical expression of the tragic duality inherent in western society.
However, being and nonbeing, life and death, yang and yin are inseparable.
A global, holistic consciousness – symbolized by Tao – includes these
opposites but in varying proportions.
Astrological textbooks, inspired by statements made in Theosophical
books, often claim that the first house is the house of “personality.” This, as
I see it, can be most misleading, if by the ambiguous term personality one
means the total person and what it radiates. What the Ascendant and the
first house actually represent is the original impulse of individual being or,
we might say, the self as a particular vibration and rhythm, and the unique
destiny of the individual ever so little different from all other individuals.
This impulse has to acquire substantial material around it in order to exist as
a truly functioning human being. The newborn, with his rudimentary
consciousness, has to learn what he is able to use as body, faculties, and
possessions – second house – then what the limitations are that may be
imposed upon this use by his environment, and the opportunities it also
affords him – third house. Only then can the consciousness, the I, become
fully organized and stable as a “person.”
The fourth house experiences deal with this process of integration and
stabilization. At the primary level of the biological and psychic-cultural
consciousness, integration is theoretically or ideally achieved within a home
and in terms of a definite, stable tradition. The normal successfully
integrated person is a sound specimen of a family type as well as of a
collective ideal of culture and social behavior. As a truly individualized
person he becomes centered in the unique rhythm and power of his
individual selfhood and destiny. At a still higher level this individuality
becomes consciously and totally attuned to the needs of mankind, and the
person becomes a “personage” with some kind of mission as an agent of
Man or God. The astrological character of the fourth house and the planets
which may be located in this section of the chart should help to discover the
best way to reach a state of integration and to acquire a solid, effectual basis
for the personality.
Personality, as the term is used here, is more than merely a biopsychic
organism able to function effectively among other organisms; it can be considered an engine able to release power for work. Indeed, every
organism is actually an engine through which life energy operates. The
functional integration of parts within a living whole generates power. This
power has to be used in some manner, and the experiences related to this
use belong to the field of the fifth house, which therefore is called the area
of personal self-expression.
The vertical axis of an astrological chart refers to power; the horizontal,
to consciousness. The land of power related to the fourth house is private, in
the sense that it is produced by the biopsychic whole that we call an
individual person. It is the power of a particularized manifestation of the
type of life generally characterized by the human species, homo sapiens. It
is the power implied in “being a person.” This person in most cases is
basically conditioned, if not entirely determined, by ancestral family and
socio-cultural patterns. It is an engine mainly mass-produced on the
assembly lines we call tradition, family, school, and environment. Yet, in
some cases, and in vastly increasing numbers today, these culturally massproduced persons leave the factory for special treatment, not only acquiring
individual characteristics – even mass-produced engines do not operate in
exactly the same way – but becoming independent and self-actualizing. A
person then is no longer a mere biosocial specimen, but is truly
individualized, which means that a power operating at another level than
life takes hold, at first perhaps most hesitantly and incompletely, of the
engine of personality. This power can be called Spirit, Soul, Self, or even
God according to the kind of metaphysics one accepts. It operates through
the mind, which in turn affects the biological organism, but it is not mind in
the usual sense of the word. Some philosophers and psychologists speak of
will, but here again one must differentiate between what is most often
called will, and belongs merely to the realm of biological drives and
emotional desires, and the spiritual Will which alone can truly
individualize.
Will is power ready for concrete expression. It is that which actualizes
what has been only a potentiality. The Ascendant refers to the potential of
being. It is symbolically “the Word that was in the beginning,” the logos.
But a word is only an image potently able to mobilize force, of itself it can
do nothing until it arouses a feeling in a concrete, actual organism. Then the
power inherent in that organism is moved by the feeling and an action results. The Ascendant gives the word: the Nadir and the fourth house refer
to the organism and its capacity to be moved by an image, a word, and in
general by the kind of feeling which spontaneously mobilizes and directs
the energies of the human organism, whether at the purely physiological or
the psychological-intellectual level.
The fourth house can be said, therefore, to refer to the basic psychic
function which Carl Jung called feeling. The first house refers to Jung's
intuition, which really means a definite sensitivity to superpersonal
directives or to image-symbols revealing at once the character and meaning
of a whole complex situation. Both intuition and feeling as defined in
astrology are essentially personal, in the sense that they produce intimate
and incontrovertible experiences that concern the individual and reflect his
or her stage of development.
This stage of development is expressed in the second house by the
individual's possessions – possessions at all levels, of course – and in the
third house by the way in which the individual goes about meeting his
environment, reacting to it, and accumulating, then formulating to himself
information. A computer can be fed a multitude of data; in the same way
the family environment, the society, T.V. programs, newspapers, and a few
years at college can feed the growing brain of the child and adolescent a
mass of information – all third house experiences. These experiences are
useless, and indeed often may become psychologically toxic, unless they
are coordinated, integrated, assimilated, and therefore related to the self and
its unique capacity for centralizing consciousness – the Ascendant,
symbolically. Thus there is a time at the end of the period dominated by the
third house – theoretically late adolescence in a normal life – when one
should know to stop ingesting more and more data, and to work instead at
the process of stabilization and self-imposed limitations. In olden days this
was the time for marriage and home-building, that is, for defining precisely
where one elected – or was led – to stand, and for “taking root” in one's
own place of destiny. The concept of home and of building a family has
evidently lost a great deal of its meaning in our technological society of
rootless wanderers and of intellects avid for more and more information and
excitement, but regardless of the association of third and fourth house
experiences with a particular period of life, the fact remains that the passion
for new experiences and the accumulation of information are meaningless unless we, as individual persons, carefully assimilate these things and make
them the building blocks of our own “house of personality.” The Ascendant
may tell us who we are; but the Nadir indicates what we are, at least
potentially, and where we stand.
Third house knowledge should be transformed into fourth house power.
It is possible to stop looking for more knowledge too soon so that personal
integration and power to perform individual acts may be too narrow and
ordinary. It is also possible to keep on acquiring data which cannot be
constructively and significantly integrated into one's system of living and
world view, and this can lead to various types of catastrophes. Our whole
western society is following this latter course and may reach a stage at
which it will suffocate in a mass of unassimilable data and the neurotic
compulsion to have and to know more and more of what it can no longer
integrate within a wholesome and harmonious philosophy of being.
In the sector of the astrological chart which begins with the fourth house
– usually referred to as the North-West sector, because of the twodimensional character of the chart – everything depends upon the
indications related to the fourth house and particularly to its cusp – the
lmum Coeli, or Nadir. Fourth house experiences tell basically what the
human being is as a concrete, actual person. These personal foundations
condition what the individual will be able to express, love or hate, procreate
or create. All these activities will have either a solid character or an
uncertain one, a harmonious or a congested quality of creativity – or no
creativity at all. And this in turn will lead to the reaping of the harvest – or
to no harvest – in the type of experiences to which the sixth house refers. THE FIFTH HOUSE
Creativity as the Expression of Personal Power
Love Affairs, Gambling, Childbearing: A Look Inside Traditional
Meanings
Acting from One's Innermost Nature
In the fifth house what has been assimilated, stabilized, integrated, or built
in the fourth house produces potential energy. Power becomes available for
use. At the biological level this is not only the energy needed for
intercellular exchanges and for adjusting the body to changes of heat,
humidity, or magnetism occurring in the physical environment, but the
nervous and muscular energy required to get food, meet obstacles and
enmity, and satisfy basic physiological needs, for instance, the need of the
species to reproduce itself through mating. In a mentally and emotionally
developed individual, personal power is available to a lesser or greater
extent for self-expression in terms of social or cultural values.
Creativity is referred to the fifth house because to create, in a human
sense, is to impress upon one's community some characteristics of one's
own personality. It is to make one's own mark upon one's society, or upon
mankind in general. This obviously can be done in various ways. Giving
birth to a child and raising him to become a person of social-cultural
importance is the biological way. Producing a work of art or of literature,
founding a cultural institution, imagining and developing a great invention
which affects men's way of life, leading one's nation to a notable
achievement – all these activities exteriorize and put to use the power of the
creator, inventor, or leader. In some cases, however, the exteriorized power and the projected vision
originate in a realm that is actually superpersonal. The person becomes the
agent for some great collective or planetary and evolutionary purpose; he is
like a translucent and perfectly shaped lens through which light is
condensed and brought into focus. At this focal point power can operate and
work can be performed. This work – the creative act and its products – is
undoubtedly conditioned by the nature and temperament of the person, yet
even more basically it is determined by factors which transcend personal
idiosyncrasies and even perhaps personal desires or attempts to control the
creative process or direct it toward a consciously defined end.
We should realize, however, that when a person performs a work of
social significance in terms of his profession and under the pressure of a
collective need, and when this work has, as it were, the conscious or
unconscious backing of a social institution, a business firm, or of the whole
community, such a performance – creative though it may appear – refers
just as much or more to the eleventh house as to the fifth. In the fifth house
theoretically the person acts as strictly as possible as an individual. He is
not concerned with collective social results or, if he is, then it is mainly to
the extent that these results will bring him fame, prestige, and egosatisfaction. In the fifth house a person seeks to enhance his own nature. He
is more concerned with being “original” than with orginating. Whether or
not it is consciously acknowledged, the question “What can I get out of it?
How can this act make me feel better, more fulfilled, happier, greater?”
always lies behind his acts. This applies to nations as well as to individual
persons, as exemplified by our American approach to -international affairs.
If the fifth house traditionally is considered to be the section of a birth
chart referring to love affairs, while the seventh house refers to marriage, it
is because, at least in the old-time society, a love affair was supposed to be
merely a release of emotional-sexual tensions and/or personal frustrations
and unhappiness, or often a mere play or pastime, or a contact determined
by personal ambition. On the other hand a marriage or a steady business
partnership implied the permanent union of persons who conceived this
association as a means to produce biological, social, or cultural results –
results that were considered functional in terms of the whole community.
Marriage until quite recently did not mean the freely sought union of two
independent persons seeking in this union a way of greater personal fulfillment in love, for a marriage was most often arranged according to
class and financial status for the purpose of preserving the human race and
the values of a particular culture and religion through the procreation of
children properly educated to perform this role – a point which today is
very often misunderstood or conveniently forgotten.
The fifth house is the area of experiences which are essentially the
outcome of emotions, and we should be careful to distinguish emotions
from feelings. Feelings are experienced in the fourth house because they
constitute the spontaneous reactions of a whole organism to a life situation,
whether at the purely biological and instinctual, or at the psychological and
individualized level. It may be an inner situation – as when a person feels
pain in some part of his body because an organ has been injured – or an
outer situation caused by an encounter with another person. Feeling is a
holistic process involving an organic state of consciousness, or at least
semi-consciousness. This state then seeks exteriorization, and the
exteriorizing process is both an e-motion – a “moving out” – at the
psychological level, and at the physical level some kind of muscular or
chemical reaction. The lie detector and related instruments have shown
conclusively that all emotions – whether fear, love, depression, happiness,
or anger – are synchronized with organic changes and muscular
movements, however slight and unconscious these may be.
It is such responses to confrontation or to inner happenings – making
definite mental images in meditation can be one of these – which should be
considered fifth house experiences. The fifth house has been associated
with “gambling” in any form, from gambling for love to taking risks in
promoting artistic or financial enterprises. Such an association is valid
whenever the gambler strictly follows his hunches or imagination, or
succumbs to the pressure of an inner frustration or complex. But when the
risk-taking is discussed with a partner and based on an intellectual
evaluation of social and business processes, then it should be referred to the
eighth, or in some cases to the eleventh, house.
It is also traditional to speak of the fifth house as referring to
childbearing and education, at least in its earlier stage. The reason for this is
that most parents tend to consider their children projections and extensions
of their own personalities; they often expect their children to be what they
have failed to be. They may seek to give them opportunities they did not have in their own youth, or project upon them their own longings and
ambitions, perhaps so they can vicariously enjoy their achievements and
even their loves. Parents may also feel that it is their duty more or less
forcibly to impart to their children the culture and the manners which they
themselves received from their own parents.
Education thus becomes a process of impressing upon the supposedly
virgin mind and feeling-nature of a child a collective set of socio-cultural
rules and patterns of response. If understood in this way the educational
process takes only minimal cognizance of the child's individuality and
uniqueness of being and destiny. This, more than anything else, is what has
produced today's youth rebellion. This rebellion is partly the result of the
fact that many parents are no longer convinced that their cultural and
religious-ethical tradition is worth being passed on, or that changing
circumstances of life in our technological age makes this impossible. It is
also the result of the great increase in the many kinds of external
stimulations – T.V. dramas and news, parental scenes at home, constant
change of environment, etc. – which generate premature sensorial and
intellectual development, while leaving the feeling nature without rootsustainment and examples of integrated and solid group living.
At the biological level the fifth house can still refer to one's progeny
even in our chaotic society. Today, however, it has come to deal
increasingly with the attempts at emotional self-expression and creativity of
men and women who need to “let off steam” while engaged in dull and
automatic activities, and who must find some kind of outlet for their
frustrations and neurotic compulsions. This house nevertheless is also the
field of experiences which refer to the truly creative activities of great
artists and the glamorous performances of musicians, actors, and movie
stars.
Every house of the birth chart refers to some great test, because every
class of basic experience compels the developing individual to face himself
in a new way and to deal with a particular category problems10. The sign on
the cusp of a house and the character of the planets which may be found in
this house should give the student of astrology clues as to the best way in
which he or she can solve these problems. No planet can be considered to
give indications which are in themselves negative, for they all refer to a type of energy which is essentially valuable, even if man at his present stage
of evolution tends in many instances to use it imperfectly or so as to
produce cathartic and perhaps disintegrative effects.
We may define the test involved in first house experiences as that of
isolation, that is, emergence from the mass as a unique individual. In the
second house the test is of ownership. In the third house The test is of
thought, that is, how to take a conscious and intelligent approach to the
challenges of one's environment. In the fourth house the test is of stability.
In the fifth house the great test involves the ability to act out one's
innermost nature in terms of purity of motive and using in a “pure” manner
the means available for the release of one's energies.
The words pure and purity have been sadly abused. To be pure is to be
exclusively what one is as a unique individual in terms of one's own
destiny. Pure water is water that contains no sediment or foreign chemical
substance; it is purely H2O. A pure action is one which exteriorizes the
essential character or nature of the actor. To be pure is to perfectly and
exclusively perform one's dharma – the Bhagavad-Gita adds “with no
personal concern for the fruits of the action,” for such a concern indicates
ego-involvement in what the act will do to the actor.
Every action implies a release and a conscious or unconscious use of
power. Energy flows out of the actor. A pure act is one which uses energy
according to the intrinsic character and rhythm of that energy. For instance,
at the strictly biological level, the nature and function of sexual energy is
essentially the procreation of children which will perpetuate the human
race. The result of procreation – the child and his needs – eventually
demands a vast expenditure of energy and work on the part of his parents.
The male and female organisms in copulation act as carriers of the sperm
and the ovum – this is their natural sexual function. They act then as
servants of life, and life responds to their dedication, unconscious though it
may be, by exalting in them their vital rhythms, which is the meaning of
the orgasm. The moment of exaltation “feels” wonderful, and human beings
therefore want to repeat it. But to repeat it under conditions which preclude
the procreative purpose is, at the biological level, cheating life; therefore
religious institutions, like the Roman Catholic Church, which consider
biological factors essential foundations for basic rites and, in general, human values – whether or not they would admit this fact – oppose
contraceptive practices.
Man, however, does not function only at the biological level where he
serves the human species; neither does he operate only at the social-cultural
level at which he is a carrier of values and traditions. Man can become truly
individualized, at which time his immediate goal becomes fulfillment as a
whole person. Sex at this level acquires an entirely different meaning, for it
refers mainly to the possibility for two persons to find in each other what
they need – that is, what they individually lack – for personal fulfillment
and creative happiness. The interpenetration of their biopsychic energies
can powerfully help to bring about in each partner a more wholesome
approach to existence and to social contacts or problems. This then is the
psychological and, secondarily, social value of sex. Such a value is denied if
the sexual act comes to mean no more than self-gratification, a mere release
of glandular energies, or the fulfillment of some egocentric personal or
social purpose. The act then loses its purity. It becomes adulterated.
For the person to whom occult energies or subtle biopsychic forces are
real and significant factors in his potential development, purity in relation to
sexual acts may have a still different meaning. He may see in the sexual act
a process of attunement, and perhaps identification with the great polarities
of cosmic existence – the Yin and Yang of Chinese philosophy, the Shiva
and Shakti of the Hindu Tantras. If this occult or mystical approach is
earnestly followed, then any personal or ego-conditioned feeling and
thought during the ritualistic act would constitute an impurity. In this
approach, the personal characteristics of the partners lose all significance:
what counts is the ability of the partners to avoid bringing personal cravings
or unconscious compulsions into the act. It is very rare for a western man or
woman to be able to conceive of and experience sex in this manner, but it
may be that some young persons today awkwardly and intuitively are trying
to reach such a level of sexual experience.
Everything I have said in the above paragraphs about the sexual
experience can be applied equally well to the performance of any action.
The Medieval Christian ideal of doing every act, even the most routine, as if
in the presence of God, is another way of staring the same thing. Any action
can be performed out of mere biological or social necessity, or it can be
performed in terms of the demands, the passions, the frustrations, or the moods of the personal ego. At a higher level, the performance can be totally
dedicated to God, or – what is essentially the same thing – it can be so open
and attuned to the great rhythms of the universe that the performer truly
experiences himself as an agent of cosmic powers, a single thread in the
sublime tapestry of the universe. THE SIXTH HOUSE
Experiences of Crisis and Personal Readjustment
Discipleship as a Means of Self-Transformation
The Test of Suffering and the Capacity to Serve
The sixth house is a cadent house it is the last of the three houses which
have their symbolic origin in the Nadir, that is, in the lowest end of the
vertical axis of a birth chart, the meridian line. The cadent houses are the
third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth, but there is a basic difference between the
sixth and twelfth houses which end respectively in the Descendant and the
Ascendant – the western and eastern points of the natal horizon – and the
third and ninth houses which end respectively with the Nadir and Zenith.
The horizon is an unmistakable fact of experience. It separates what is
above from what is below the Earth's surface. No division can be more
concrete. The vertical line of the meridian, however, is not so easily
perceptible. The eastern and western halves of the sky and of the whole
chart are not separated by any obvious partition. One moves easily from the
third house to the fourth, but the transition from the sixth to the seventh,
and from the twelfth to the first houses is sharp. It indeed implies a crisis of
perception, a “revolution in consciousness.” The sixth house refers to a
period of personal readjustment; the twelfth to a period of social and
existential repolarization. Yet the sixth house type of experience leads
naturally to the seventh, and as a man experiences in the twelfth house the
closing phase of a cycle of experience he is also sowing, whether he knows
it or not, the seeds which will produce and condition the beginning of a new
cycle in the first house. Why should there be experiences of sixth house readjustment and what
does such a readjustment imply? This question can he answered by
considering the fact that the sixth house follows the fifth house of selfexpression and emotional or creative activity. A time comes in every man's
life when he is forced to realize that what he does, feels, or thinks does not
come up to the ideal of behavior, personal achievement, and success which
he has set for himself. Even the most self-satisfied individual is aware of
some lack; his self-satisfaction is very often a screen behind which he hides
an unacknowledged sense of inferiority, uncertainty, or dread of failure. If
there were such a thing as a completely self-satisfied person, life would
someday prove to him that his body or his mind, his emotions or his nerves
were not able to meet some emergency or challenge. Illness, pain, inner
doubts, and conflicts are characteristic proofs of at least relative defeat or
inadequacy.
But who can succeed completely in the exteriorization and actualization
of the potentialities inherent in his personality? Once the creative work is
completed, the composer, writer, or artist is often painfully aware that he
could have produced a greater work. The lover comes to the point when
love ebbs away or brusquely terminates, and the poignant feeling may arise:
“Why was I not able to keep this love relationship radiant, fulfilling? What
did I do or say that disturbed or killed the feeling of communion?” And the
parent or educator who encounters the rebelliousness and perhaps scorn or
enmity of the child he had wanted to educate cannot help but wonder that
he did wrong, or if the ideal he projected upon the child was really of any
value. Thus, an experience of failure arises as self-expression and creative
efforts meet reversals and the mind and soul feel empty and defeated by life
– indeed, to some degree at least, self-defeated.
The real problem in such circumstances is what the individual does with
his experience of failure and the results of at least relative defeat. How does
he respond to the realization that he lacks strength, endurance, adaptability,
technical skill or wisdom, refinement, and the ability genuinely to love?
How does he meet the realization of the necessity for self-improvement?
How should he meet it so as to ensure the best possible results?
A man's true inner worth is often revealed when he has to face
experiences of inadequacy, lack, frustration, or defeat. When he is equal to
the ordinary needs of the day and able to meet with fair poise what life and society – or his family – demand of him, we see only his abilities at work.
When these fail or are not equal to their task, when his body falls ill or his
mind loses its normal stability, then we see the person himself. But we
actually come to know this person's real self not so much by what he
achieves as by the way he approaches the emergency, by the quality of his
response to lack and defeat.
If a person with great reserves of vitality falls ill and makes a
spectacular recovery, if a nation confronted with war or disaster throws
itself successfully into a program of enormous production, this does not
necessarily reveal the greatness of the individual's inner self or of the soul
of the people. What counts spiritually is the quality of the effort and what
this effort creates in the person or the nation. It is the aftermath of victory
that tests the spiritual quality of the victory. It is what victory does to the
mind and soul of the victorious.
Crises are opportunities for growth as well as challenges, but there is
growth and growth! A man can grow bigger and fatter, more wealthy and
more self-important. Does that make him better able to meet the next crisis?
Does it make him come closer to fulfillment of his true and essential
purpose in life? If it does not, then it is only a false kind of growth. To grow
is to become, actually and effectively, what you are potentially, as a spiritual
being, at the threshold of your birth. It is to achieve the essential purpose of
your life as a whole – God's purpose for you, as the religiously inclined
person would Say.
The essential question, then, is: How can I best orient myself to an
oncoming crisis? If it comes unannounced (such as sudden illness, an
accident or death), what is the most basic power, function, or drive that I
should call into play to meet the emergency – and, what is more, to meet it
so that I grow spiritually from the effort?
Most people, obviously, do not stop to ask these questions or to find the
answers; it is well that they do not, at least at first, because it is good for a
young person to test himself, to know his limitations by actual failure. This
builds character and a realization of “self.” But when they grow older and
realize that there is something quite wrong about the way they have
approached their crises and dealt with their illnesses or sense of inferiority,
then the time has come for finding out more about themselves and their
innate ability to meet these crises. Reorientation has proven to be necessary. New techniques, perhaps, must be learned and, what is more fundamental, a
new approach to the use of the skills one already possesses.
This is where the idea of discipleship comes in. One may learn the
tricks of the trade from written instructions or from an impersonal
statement. One may memorize a set of responses to a critical situation – for
instance, what to do in a traffic jam when driving a car. This is technical
knowledge; today in America we worship this kind of knowledge. But a
technically skillful driver may – through impatience, emotional
recklessness, or over-fatigue and nervous tension – still cause a serious
accident. The technique may be there, adequate to meet the impending
crisis, but the personal, emotional, or physiological approach to the
possibility of crisis may defeat the ability to use that technique. In some
cases, the presence of a subconscious wish for failure or death may make
defeat almost compulsive.
Discipleship, when properly understood, does not mean simply learning
a skill. It is being subjected to the contagion of example from an individual
who not only has the skill, but is able to use it to the fullest in times of
crisis. A student acquires knowledge from a teacher; a disciple receives
from his master the power to transform his personal attitude to life, to
himself, and to God, so that he can use whatever knowledge he has – or
whatever inspiration comes to him – effectively and creatively.
This power that the disciple receives, however, does not come to him
unless he qualifies for it. He must discover the manner in which he can
best qualify, and this implies always some kind of preliminary reorientation.
Before the disciple can actually receive the power to experience, with the
help of the master, a true inner metamorphosis, he must desire to change
and to grow. He must be ready to serve and to obey, for true and eagerly
accepted service is the only cure for egocentricity or selfishness. The
capacity to obey and to take directions is necessary if the disciple is to pass
successfully through crises that imply a challenge to the very existence of
his ego.
Because the sixth house represents fundamentally everything that deals
with personal crises and the way to meet them, it shows, more than any
other factor in the whole of the astrological field, how an individual can
grow and become transformed. It indicates, by its contents, the basic type or
types of challenges to be expected whenever opportunities for growth are presented. These opportunities may be presented by life itself, or by the
presence of the master and spiritual guide, whose task it is to make the
opportunities more definite and, thus, the crises more focalized and acute.
In traditional astrology textbooks, the sixth house is said to refer to
employment – either to servants one employs or to one's employer – to
everyday work, to all forms of training, to matters concerning health and
hygiene – and in specific cases to military service. As usual, such
traditional meanings by themselves are superficial, limiting, and fail to
reveal the basic significance of this most important house.
The basic significance is that of personal growth. Growth means
transformation or change of condition. This change requires taking a new
step forward, or, if the motion is negative, backward. In every new step a
person takes, there is a moment during which he is off balance, having left a
previous state of equilibrium (or stability) and not yet having reached the
state ahead. This off-balance state indicates a crisis. All crises are
transitions between two states or conditions of existence or consciousness.
Most transitions are difficult or painful; hardly any man will pass through
them deliberately and consciously unless he is made to desire the risk by a
sharp or poignant realization that he lacks some skill, that he has, at least
partly, failed or been defeated.
Illness may be the direct result of some defeat of the vital energies
unable to cope with a challenge to grow stronger, or an attempt by the soul
to impress upon the consciousness the need for a revision of attitude, or the
normal sign of bodily disintegration in old age. It may also be imposed
upon the body, or the mind, by the violent impact of some over-all social
crisis, war, or revolution. In this case, however, the twelfth house is the
main field of disturbance; the sixth house, its polar opposite, primarily
shows the response of the individual to a social situation.
One should not forget, however, that for the individual to respond to a
social or national need is the normal way to grow; this normal way does not
inevitably require that he pass through acute crises or experience illness.
What is demanded is that he contribute to the productivity and growth of his
community, and this contribution usually takes the form of employment or
service. Such a contribution may include a multitude of small crises or
determined efforts to adjust to social conditions – even if it is only daily
commuting in crowded subways, or the effort to overcome fatigue every morning as the alarm clock – the modem slave driver! – whips one out of
slumber.
If the relation of an individual to his community is negative,
employment means slavery, crude or attenuated; if one's society is torn by
war or revolution, the field of sixth house experiences means compulsory
military service of some sort. Crises become sharper then, even if they are
small and repeated. Yet these crises still can mean growth for the individual
– the slave can demonstrate far greater spiritual growth than his ruthless
master! What counts is the attitude taken and the degree to which the spirit
within, the inner self, has been aroused and has been able to induce
transformations in the total personality. This should include, at least to some
extent, the transformation of the body's responses and instinctual urges and
desires.
At the limit, the alternative to transformation is death. Death can be a
very slow and gradual process to which the individual soul assents or even
induces out of weariness or despair. Growth always means some type of
transformation. The message of the sixth house is: Be ye transformed! No
person with an emphasized natal sixth house should seek to escape or refuse
to heed this call for transformation.
To conform is to accept a static condition; it is to accept the inevitability
of crystallization, the degradation of the living into the inanimate, the stone.
All dynamic living implies transformation – the transformation of one's
personality and creative contribution to the transformation of society and
civilization. To be creative is to be an agent of transformation; it is to use
crises to the fullest so they come to mean effective and successful
metamorphoses.
Birth, catharsis, and metamorphosis most often imply suffering. The
great sixth house test is the test of suffering – and also of patience and
endurance. The ability to endure with such vibrant and steady faith that the
crisis will lead to a new type of experience and thus to a kind of rebirth or
reintegration is the assurance of success. Still, faith does not make the pain
or psychic pressures and anxiety any less real; it may, however, give them
constructive meaning, and man can endure almost anything that he realizes
to be meaningful, unless the vital powers of his body can no longer activate
worn-out organs. In a well-known Gnostic hymn of the early Christian centuries Jesus is
made to say: “If you had known how to suffer, you would have had the
power not to suffer.” Suffering is the path to repolarization or rebirth. The
Resurrection implies the preceding Crucifixion. One must learn to face
failure with courage and clear thinking – whether it be your own failure or
that of persons close to you or of your society as a whole. One must
confront the causes of failure or frustration objectively and dispassionately,
as if from a distance, yet with compassion and without guilt feeling. This is
detachment and also what is really meant by severance. Severance does not
deny empathy; it creates distance, and distance is essential in the evaluation
of what has happened.
It is said that time heals all wounds, but this is only because the many
subtle bonds of feelings and memories which linked the doer with the deed
one by one break and vanish from the consciousness as other experiences
come crowding upon the mind moment after moment, year after year. The
doer disinvolves himself from the deed, and the suffering is forgotten –
until the day, perhaps, when a new test of one's capacity to transform
oneself and to reassess and reorient the release of the personality is met. It
must be met at the very place within the field of consciousness at which a
similar one once was experienced. All depends then on the quality of the
healing process that had taken place. Complete healing strengthens the
disturbed function; incomplete, it may leave the organism weakened and
vulnerable.
The sixth house refers to all experiences of healing, and to the fear of
illness” or failure. If the roots of the personality are not deep or extensive,
the individual seeking self-expression and emotional fulfillment in fifth
house activities is more likely to fail in his attempts if he uses selfexpression to mask his longing for help. Failure then leads to self-pity. The
hurt consciousness cries out: “Why did this happen to me?” It happened
because the individual had not yet realized his full power and his essential
destiny.
Such a realization often comes through dedication to a work. It may
come in service, for it is only by serving that one can gain mastery. The
deepest worth of an individual is revealed in his capacity and readiness to
serve – which may mean his ability to recognize greatness in others and to
feel humble. The great person is humble because he knows, deep inside himself, how much greater he might have been. True greatness precludes
self-satisfaction. Only the great man can see beyond himself; and the vision
of that beyond must pass through the “shadow” attached to any
achievement. In the sixth house the individual may meet his shadow – not
the final “Guardian of the Threshold” who belongs more to the twelfth
house, but the shadow of one's desire to be great, noble, powerful. This may
come through humiliation, illness, or uncontrollable fear when the
challenge of destiny comes. It may be a strongly cathartic experience; it can
also be an exalting and transforming Visitation. The quality of the response
of the total being to this Visitation determines the quality of the truly
productive relationships into which the individual can enter with others.
The presence of a planet in the sixth house of a birth chart does not
imply that this planet is in a disadvantageous position. There is nothing
intrinsically negative or “bad” about this natal house. When a planet is
located in it this means that the basic function represented by this planet
should be used in order most successfully to meet the experiences related to
work, service, illness, self-transformation, retraining, and the repolarization
of one's energies and of the ego that has used them to some extent
ineffectually. These experiences are necessary to the total process of
individual growth. They occur at two or three levels, from that of material
work and health care to that of true discipleship to a “master of works.”
These experiences should not be shunned just because they usually involve
strain and stress, pain and suffering. As I have written elsewhere: “Pain is
the custodian of our undiscovered treasures . . . Men are not quite yet 'Man.'
They are moving toward the Mastery, the right use of 'human power' . . .
Suffering is the footstool of our divinity. We may stumble over it and fall
back into the womb of time to renew once more our tragic attempt at
metamorphosis. Or we may step upon it, raise our countenance by damming
the very stream of our tears, and use suffering to reach the extended hands
of Him Who is our resurrected Self. Suffering can only cease with the
Resurrection, in any man who is truly human. For to be man is to be
ceaselessly more what one is. Until humanity merges into divinity. Until the
individual becomes Man. Until all victorious men, having learned to use
rightly in its fullness the power that is theirs in God, no longer need
suffering11.” THE SEVENTH HOUSE
The Development of Cooperation and Sharing
Relationship as Participation in a Greater Whole
Fulfilling Individual Destiny through Partnership
As the seventh house is reached we are dealing with experiences that result
from a type of activity based no longer primarily upon the individual self
but instead upon sustained modes of relationship to other selves, modes of
relationship which imply a fundamental sense of cooperation and sharing
with other persons. But mere cooperation does not tell the whole story, for
of itself it may have but an impermanent and superficial value. The
cooperators should feel that their “operation in common” serves a purpose
within a larger unit of existence, normally within a particular social
community, or at most within mankind considered as a planetary organism.
It should be a functional participation. One should find implied in the
relationship between two partners an at least dim realization of what the
relationship is for, what is its purpose; and in this purpose each partner
should then be able to discover his or her own individual purpose. A life
without purpose – or, as the American Indian would say, without a “vision”
– is hardly worth living; it is not greatly different from the life of an animal.
But obviously human beings can live, act, and cooperate, consciously or
instinctually, in terms of a variety of purposes.
This matter of purpose is very important astrologically – as well as
psychologically and socially – or it alone can clarify the basic relationship
between the first, the fourth, the seventh, and the tenth houses. In the first
house a man can realize intuitively – and at first in an instinctual sense
below the threshold of what we call consciousness – that he is an individual “I.” This realization, in terms of actual and effectual existence, leads in the
fourth house to a conscious and more or less stabilized feeling of being a
particular person with a particular character and certain basic beliefs and
values, on the basis of which the person acts, expresses himself, succeeds or
fails, learns and suffers on the path of self-transformation. This selftransformation implies a change of polarity. The individual comes to realize
that, willy-nilly, he or she is a component part of a larger whole. This is
often a confusing realization which leaves one quite insecure, faced, as it
were, with a great question mark on the horizon of consciousness. What am
I supposed to do? Will I be able to do it well?
The child very likely does not ask himself these questions, at least not in
a basic sense, because he normally takes for granted his belonging to a
family and an environment. He tries to express himself in it, is hurt, learns,
etc. It is normally at puberty, with the rise of sexual energies, that the
feeling that some power far greater than his limited consciousness arises.
The human species claims the child – he or she has to perform a special
function, he or she has a biological, personality-transcending purpose. The
adolescent is also increasingly claimed by his society as he goes to high
school and college. He finds himself operating in a field of activity in which
he is not sure what is demanded of him, or whether he likes and can fit in
with these demands. He may be emotionally lost, he may rebel blindly, he
might escape into intense religious fervor and dedicate himself to the God
of devotees – the sublime Thou, Who is conveniently always there to listen
and comfort, provided He is exclusively worshipped.
In horary astrology it is said that the seventh house of a chart cast at a
certain time to answer an inquirer's question shows “the result of the
matter” inquired into. The function of an organism is the result of his
identity – first house. Everything is born to fulfill a particular function. That
function can be known only, however, if the new entity is related to the
other entities with which it has to cooperate. “Life” produces males and
females, but they are of no value to the human species unless they function
together. Each person learns what he or she is, not only biologically but in
terms of the socio-cultural community, only as he functions together with
other human beings. This functional cooperation eventually produces
something of value to the human race, to the particular society, or to both. If a primitive man in New Guinea found an old airplane propeller lying
in a field, he could describe its shape in detail and even build some kind of
sculptural decoration around it; it has “form” and is made of substances
which can be determined. It is an entity; but the New Guinea tribesman
does not know what it is for. He could only know this, if he could be taught
how it operates in relation to other objects, all of which are functional parts
of an organized system with a definite purpose: that is, flying. If a man who
never left city slums is sent to a forest and becomes attracted to the shape of
an acorn lying on the ground, he may play with it, even dissect it, but he
will not be able to see in it the potentiality of a great oak. He cannot know
its function, its place in the cycle of vegetation, unless he can somehow
relate it to the tree. It is only in relation to other entities that any single
entity has significance in terms of living processes or of the organized
activities of a communal or national whole.
The same is true, with some important yet perhaps not so essential
differences, of a human being. We may know what he is made of
structurally and biologically, but such a knowledge is necessarily
incomplete until we see him function in relation to other individuals and
within a collective social-cultural field of activity.
Function suggests purpose, and both are inherent and potential in what a
man is, but they are revealed only as he operates within the larger whole
within which he is a participating unit. Theoretically, the purpose of an
individual existence is fulfilled in the tenth house, but this fulfillment –
positive or negative, partial or complete – results from what was established
or realized consciously at the level of the seventh house. The quality of a
person's relationship to others at the functional level is the foundation upon
which he will achieve or fail to achieve whatever has been the inherent
purpose of his existence since he was born, whether or not he has been at all
aware of that purpose.
Individual experiences related to the seventh house should all refer to
activities which, at least potentially, have a functional character. The
ultimate keynote of these experiences is participation; yet the experiencer
may not be aware at first that he is participating in a greater whole – a
community, or the human species. He may be enthralled by his partner and
the excitement of the partnership, or he may be confused by it. The
glamorous feeling of coming to know and experience fully another human being in and through whom one may reach self-fulfillment powerfully
affects the honey-moon period of the relationship. It is, however, often as
the partners settle down to the everyday work involved in the relationship
that its functional meaning becomes clear. The value of a public and
ritualistic marriage ceremony is that, at the very beginning of the conjugal
relationship, its social significance – how it is to be a part of family and
group processes – is definitely asserted and solemnized. The expected
presence of some result to come from the conjugal relationship – children,
or at least some form of cooperative achievement – is made to overshadow
the purely emotional tension and the ecstasy inherent in the relationship. It
is for the same reason that a man entering an important public office is
made to go through a public ceremony of inauguration or coronation. He is
entering into a relationship which has a definite public function –
relationship with new associates with whom he is to cooperate in the
fulfillment of his task. He is wedded to a social purpose.
This act of being wedded to a purpose is inherent in all seventh house
types of relationship, even – I repeat – if the individuals being related are
barely aware of the basis of their association. But it is only in the eighth
house that the responsibility which such an association entails becomes
apparent to the partners, perhaps vividly and emotionally. As it may mean
the “death” of some illusions, and the regeneration of the partners' egos, the
eighth house has been called the house of death and regeneration.
Today the concept of marriage has changed so much that it seems as if
the relationship of a man and a woman has no function other than that of
bringing personal happiness, security, and emotional fulfillment to the
partners, with no significant reference to either progeny – service to the race
– or social-cultural achievement-service to the community. This, in a sense,
is the result of the over- individualistic and analytical character of our
civilization and its piecemeal consciousness which considers parts as if
there were no whole in which they were meant to operate. These parts
nevertheless are also wholes, which themselves are constituted by many
interrelated and interdependent parts.
Today the answer to this, often taken for granted, is that a human being
is a very special kind of whole which does not belong functionally to any
larger unit. From the point of view of the philosopher believing in
“Personalism,” every person is an end in himself, a kind of absolute. He relates to other persons, but this relationship is essentially personalistic; that
is, it is not a part of any cosmic operation, it is not “functional.” Society,
mankind, the planet Earth do not constitute “organisms” of which human
individuals can symbolically be called component cells. Essentially, each
individual stands alone and self-sufficient, as a monad. Contacts made with
other individuals have a purely existential character; they have value and
meaning only in terms of what they bring to each individual separately.
All this may seem quite metaphysical and of little consequence to the
astrologer, but actually the preceding paragraphs present the basic
opposition between the two most important approaches to the relationship
between two or more individual persons, and between these persons and
both the organized social community in which they live and the human race
as a whole. Whether one takes one approach or the other will fundamentally
affect what human relationship, marriage, and partnership will actually
mean in everyday life. The sad thing is that people today more or less
unconsciously try to live partly in terms of one of these approaches, and
partly in terms of the other. Thus a basic confusion reigns in all matters of
human relationship–all seventh house matters.
The old-time religious approach to conjugal relationship and to any at
least relatively permanent partnership in work having a social or cultural
character was basically functional. Today this functional foundation is
lacking in a great many instances. Individual meets individual just for the
sake of development of their respective personalities. This, of course, can
be very valid and constructive, but the relationship becomes an end in itself,
or rather a means to assist the fourth house development of the essentially
separate personalities, or the release of fifth house energies. When this is
the case, then it is almost inevitable that sooner or later some eighth house
type of experiences will spell death – or if all goes well, transforming
rebirth – to the relationship.
To sum up: experiences related to the seventh house – that is, to
marriage and all forms of more or less stable partnerships – can merely
mean the cooperation of individuals, or they can mean participation in a
larger whole to which the related persons are deeply conscious of
belonging in terms of a common destiny or a definite social-cultural
purpose. The main issue in these relationships is not whether there is great
love, or the deeply felt common interest of business partners, but what is the quality of this love or this common interest. The marriage may mean what
the French call l'egoisme a deux – a difficult phrase to translate, but
meaning the union of two persons solely for their own mutual satisfaction
and personal growth12; the business partnership may be entered into solely
for the profit of the two partners with no concern for social consequences.
On the other hand, the relationship may be consecrated to a more-thanpersonal purpose at whatever level it may be.
No astrologer can positively tell which of the two approaches a person
will follow in his or her close and stable relationships, but the zodiacal sign
on the cusp of the house, the place and aspects to the ruler of that sign, and
the nature of the planets which may be located in the seventh house can tell
a great deal that can help a sincere person eager to participate in a greater
field of existence to determine what are the best conditions for such a
participation, and perhaps also alert him to some of the dangers or tests
involved in it. This may not make the relationship easier; it could make it
more significant and more fruitful.
The most important point, astrologically speaking, implied in all the
above discussion is that one should never consider the seventh house – or
indeed any house – alone when interpreting a matter referring to
experiences or problems dealing with this area of human existence and
activity. The principle of relatedness. Descendant, and the principle of
selfhood. Ascendant, constitute two independent polarities. What one is as
an individual self will be demonstrated in the way one relates to other
persons and to the world in general; likewise the results of relationships
provide feedback which affects what psychologists today call one's “self
image.”
The pattern of individual selfhood – which at the biological level
manifests itself in the genetic code within all the cells' nuclei – is a
permanent factor in the cycle of an individual's existence. Change in the
personality comes through all types of relationships. Relationship is the
creative – and in some cases, destructive – answer to the existential fact of
relatedness. The seventh house is thus potentially the most dynamic of all
houses. It is in this field of human experience that the person can be most
basically transformed. It is also here that man experiences his greatest
freedom–unless certain planets are very close to the descendant, planets which symbolize compelling pressures of destiny which alone can build
through the magic of relationship the type of foundations required for the
fulfillment of a powerful purpose inherent in the individual self. In such a.
case, the individual may find himself driven by this purpose to enter into a
certain type of relationship, or into a relationship with a certain type of
person, which might provide experiences that can serve best to dynamize
the purpose of destiny, even if if be through stress and strain, or even
tragedy.
Marriage, and other kinds of partnership as well, can be a field of
unresolvable tensions. The experiences derived from these tensions can also
serve the purpose of personal growth and lead to the fulfillment of the
individual's destiny. The planet near the Descendant is normally a strong
indication of how best to meet such experiences. They will be met at
different levels according to an individual's stage of development and, one
might add, according to the phase in the evolution of the “Soul” which this
particular life embodies. A dialectical process can be seen at work here, as
indeed everywhere, revealing three basic levels of relatedness.
At the basic biological and tribal level all relationships are subservient
to the compulsive dictates of life and to the welfare of the communal group.
Relationships are definitely purposeful and regulated socially by strong
taboos, essentially formulated in view of what is naturally valuable and
constructive for the tribal whole, though in time other preoccupations may
pervert the original purpose.
When man reaches the stage where the individualization process begins
to operate strongly, relationships take on a more personal character, but the
basic relationship of marriage is still subject to the biological imperative
and to the need to preserve and transmit cultural and religious values. It is
only since the Industrial Revolution began to break down traditional
patterns of relationship – actually not before the beginning of this century –
that an intensified kind of individualism and the revolt of women against
patriarchal rules have utterly transformed the institution of marriage.
Marriage has lost most of its social and institutional-religious character. It
has ceased to be in most cases an affair determined by parents, social class,
and financial values. It is now mainly a matter of two individuals coming
together of their free will in order to enjoy a richer life in common. Thus
the factors of selfhood and relatedness have received nearly all the attention and those referring to the tenth and even the fourth houses have lost their
main importance – this, because the majority of marriages, at least in the
United States, are without a sense of destiny and social or transcendent
purpose (tenth house) and practically without very vital and solid roots,
social as well as geographical.
A third level should now be reached, at which perhaps whatever is left
of the marriage pattern will be even more transformed. At that level the
relationship once more will be dominated by a common purpose – social
and supersocial, spiritual or planetary. Truly autonomous and authentic
individuals will be joining their energies, perhaps in a ritualistic manner, so
as to work for a truly common and deliberately shared purpose – a
functional purpose envisioned in terms of participation in the total evolution
of mankind and of the Earth.
It seems evident that this third level of close and creative relationship –
which can be, yet need not be, also procreative – is still inacceptable and
perhaps unthinkable for the immense majority of humanity. But great
changes may be imminent, and the emerging nonwhite countries may find
in their ancient cultures features which will make it easier for all people to
accept a new type of fruitful and super-personal togetherness. THE EIGHTH HOUSE
Death and Regeneration: Identifying with the Seed Process
Ritual as a Way of Strengthening Social Bonds
Trust and Responsibility in Business Relationships
The life of an individual is like an ellipse which has two foci, as opposed to
the circle which has but one center. These two focal points, principles or
tendencies around which gravitate the life and the consciousness of a
human being, are, as we saw, selfhood and relatedness, represented
respectively by the Ascendant and the Descendant. Because astrology refers
all of its symbols and interpretations to the beginning of cycles – the first
point of individualized existence, the first breath which relates the newborn
organism to an open environment – the houses of the birth chart are
numbered starting from the Ascendant, one through twelve. Cycles of
existence, however, are not closed circles; the two forces derived from the
principles of selfhood and relatedness dominate one half of the cycle each.
The below-the-horizon hemicycle is dominated by the drive to actualize as
fully as possible the potentialities inherent in the individual at birth; the
above-the-horizon hemicycle, while still deeply affected by this process of
self-actualization and the drive toward self-fulfillment, is powerfully
conditioned by the character and the results of the relationships the
individual must enter into if there is to be complete personal fulfillment.
For these reasons, while it is perfectly logical to number the houses
from one to twelve, one should also take into consideration the fact that at
the Descendant a new set of factors begins to occupy the person's attention
– factors related to change-producing and, at least at some level, purposeful
relationships. Thus the Descendant is also, in this sense, the starting point of a series of experiences which require productive relationships –
relationships which also inevitably transform the individual's outlook and
consciousness in a basic way. The house numbered eight, if one begins with
the Ascendant, should also be interpreted as a second house when one starts
from the Descendant. Every one of the six houses above the horizon can
therefore be said to have two fundamental meanings, one related to the
Ascendant – principle of selfhood – and the other to the Descendant –
principle of relatedness. The individual unfolds and actualizes his powers
through the first six houses, and the relationships encountered in these six
areas of existence are experienced and valued primarily in terms of the
individual self.
In the same way, what becomes actualized and productive in the six
houses which begin with the Descendant is primarily whatever the
individual encounters in terms of relationships which have an increasingly
dominant momentum and power – and this is so whether one considers
conjugal or strictly social relationships. The individual henceforth focuses
his attention less on his own self than on what relationships bring to his life.
Eventually, of course, what these relationships bring will be fed back to his
sense of self, and a new cycle will begin at a more conscious and mature –
or, negatively, at a deteriorating – level of personal existence.
This does not mean that at any moment of his life a person has
experiences only in the area of a single house. All houses are potentially
involved in every moment of life – just as summer is implied in winter, and
the icy polar wastes in tropical jungles. What the astrologer does when he
gives definite meanings to a house field in terms of a cyclic process of
personality-unfolding is to establish basic categories of experiences, and
above all the relationship between these different categories, that is, the
way in which they fit in with each other and one type depends upon and
conditions the others. Every type of experience is potentially implied in
every other, and each important experience can be related to a basic
archetype. It is the relationship of the experience to this archetype which
gives it its essential meaning in terms of the whole life of the individual.
Such is at least what a holistic approach to existence asserts. A truly full
experience may be lived in the Now, but if there is a character of true
plenitude in the experience, every field of activity – every house – will be
involved to some extent. Nevertheless, one field will be accentuated, and it is this accentuation, this focus of conscious attention, which will deeply
influence the meaning of the experience and condition its results.
When the traditional astrologer speaks of the eighth house as the house
of death and regeneration, his interpretation is based mainly on the
correspondence so often – and in my opinion, unduly – stressed between
zodiacal signs and houses; that is, the first house corresponds to Aries, the
second to Taurus, and the eighth to Scorpio. There is some validity in
making such correspondences, but usually it is just confusing. Zodiacal
signs and houses represent two fundamentally different sets of values. They
refer to different factors, even if the two sets of values are related in various
ways – particularly from the numerological point of view. In the case of the
eighth house nothing is to be gained from such a correspondence because
Scorpio is one of the less understood signs of the zodiac and the most
unintelligently maligned.
In the seasonal cycle of the solar year, Scorpio refers to mid-autumn. In
temperate climates at that time the yearly vegetation is indeed normally
experiencing “death.” But within the process of disintegration and in the
midst of the decaying leaves there are also seeds which do not die. To
identify one's consciousness with the seed process is for the individual to
rise above cyclic death, and perhaps to experience if not a transforming
mutation or fundamental repolarization, at least to participate in the
eventual rebirth of vegetation 'in springtime. Numerologically, and
according to the Gnostic-Christian tradition, eight repeated at three levels is
the symbolic number of the Christ (thus 888). The Christ mythos being
centered around the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, this number 8 fits
well the house of death and regeneration.
But the cyclic sequence of houses has another important meaning. It
refers to twelve basic phases in the unfolding of the consciousness of an
individual. Consciousness, in the western sense of the word, implies two
opposite poles: selfhood and relationship. As no individual is born alone or
without a past, the results of past relationships – karma – condition the new
self, which in turn proves himself to himself and to the world by the way he
meets and experiences new relationships. These relationships later on
condition a new self.
Thus, astrologically speaking, the Descendant should be seen to begin a
new process of which the seventh house is the first phase and the eighth house the second. The eighth house also refers to possessions, but – except
perhaps in horary in which every symbolic concept is personalized and
interpreted in terms of separate events – the traditional interpretation of this
eighth house type of possessions as “the partners possessions” is inaccurate.
What is indicated are the possessions of the relationship; that is to say, the
eighth house refers to the whole existential situation which the relationship
has to face in order to actualize its potentialities. It also reveals what is
available to the relationship on order to become an operative factor in
society.
Obviously what the relationship “owns” is what the partners bring to it.
But it is only the sum of the two contributions, for the moment there is a
seventh house type of partnership the stabilized and goal-oriented
interactions between the two partners adds a plus value to these
contributions considered separately. The quality of the partner's relationship
becomes an active and productive – or inhibiting and perhaps destructive –
factor. This is a very important point. For instance, if there is a planet in a
person's seventh house it will affect not only this person's capacity for
relationship, but also the fruitfulness of the problems affecting the eighth
house.
Moreover, just as no person is born in a void, so no relationship occurs
in empty space. The space is both the biosphere as a whole, and the
particular society to which the partners belong or in which their relationship
starts and will develop. The biosphere provides the partners – according to
climate, land, and season – with their basic physical needs; the society has
established ways in which any partnership is to be conducted. The conjugal
relationship has to meet social and religious-ethical taboos just as a business
partnership has to be incorporated, to follow a set of regulations, to pay
taxes, etc. The relationship has to conform to precedents valid in its
environment. Society provides it with a great many opportunities, but with
many restrictions as well. All of this refers to the eighth house.
The house, its cusp, and the planets located in it indicate how a person
can best and most realistically approach both the opportunities and the
restrictions involved in bringing the relationship he enters to a fruitful state.
Fruitfulness may mean money, growth, influence, or it may signify that,
through this relationship, the individual will experience a valuable self- transformation and be able to reach depths of awareness and experience
which he could never have attained alone.
Relationship should not be thought of only as involving two partners in
an exclusivistic kind of conjugal or business association. Several partners,
and indeed a group, can come together on a relatively stable and solid basis
– certainly as solid as most marriages are today. Such a group can have a
business meaning, but its purpose may be religious, political, or “occult.”
The group relationship usually operates through some kind of ritual:
modem business is a long series of rituals, from the office and factory to
Wall Street and its stock exchange; Army life is almost nothing but a
painful sequence of rituals, ending on the battlefield. A whole city, if it
were observed from above during a whole day, would present a motion
picture of traffic rituals, congestion and decongestion, light and darkness.
Religious organizations have their rituals. The purpose of all these rituals,
and of all collective festivals, including concerts, operas, and baseball
games, is to strengthen collective psychic bonds between the members of a
particular society or group. In other words, the ritual is meant to generate
the special plus factor that is produced when the group is psychically and
emotionally integrated. There is even a physical or electromagnetic
integration which takes place when human bodies touch and move together
according to shared rhythms.
The rituals that various occult or mystical groups follow in their
meetings, especially in the dangerous form of “ceremonial magic,” have the
same purpose as any social or religious rituals, except that they have, or
should have if they are effectual, a still more conscious, deliberate, and
often powerful purpose. Mantras, incantations, traditional gestures, and the
use of symbolical objects may bring to a sharp focus their will-force as well
as the emotions of the participants in the group. The rituals of the American
Indians are quite typical of a certain level of this group operation, those of
Free Masonry another. Indeed, society as a whole is founded on rituals.
It is only when individualism is intensely emphasized that the ritualistic
patterns of social institutions may break down. But soon enough the
rebellious individuals establish a new kind of rituals. The business of living
alters its group formations, its standardized procedures, and its fashions, but
the eighth house type of experiences are always there to be faced. Sexual
rituals, too, remain although fashions and moralities may change. The basic problem is whether these daily rituals are to be given a
positive, exalting, or emotionally enhancing meaning, or if they are to be
experienced as a boring routine and drudgery. It is when facing such a
problem that the ideal of the Practice of the Presence of God at every
moment of the day acquires its beautiful and healing significance. Every
ritual could evoke the Divine in its participants. It can achieve this
realization only when the quality of the relationship between the
participants makes the evocations possible – and thus their rebirth at a
higher level of inclusiveness and egoless love.
In a society in which almost everything is affected by “business” it is
indeed strange that this word is not mentioned in the traditional list of
matters to which the houses refer. To think of the second house of a birth
chart as the house of business is to miss what the word business, essentially
implies. The second house refers to what an individual privately owns and
what he can use to actualize his birth potential – whether the possessions
are tangible assets or psychological and spiritual capacities. The eighth
house deals with business proper because any type of business implies some
kind of contract or agreement involving at least two persons and being more
of less legally guaranteed by society as a whole. Marriage is or was a
contract theoretically valid “until death do us part,” and guaranteed by legal
and religious sanctions. Installment buying, mortgages, and all varieties of
exchange, whether or not they involve money, are based on interpersonal
and social relationships, and this basically means on trust.
Three basic factors are implied in all matters which really deal with the
eighth house field of experience: trust – which itself implies honesty –
management, and responsibility. And back of them stands the broad seventh
house activity of love – love as the capacity to give a constructive meaning
to interpersonal, and thus social, relationships; thus, as the substantiation of
the experienceable and concretized meaning and value of togetherness.
To participate in a ritual activity when one does not trust the participants
can be very dangerous, even though this is what one does constantly when
living in our modern society, particularly in modern cities; and this is why
our society gives to the eighth house a mainly negative meaning. Politics is
the negation of trust; and until the very concept of politics no longer finds
place in social and interpersonal relationships, social togetherness must
have its bitter fruits in the eighth house, as well as some instances of bountiful harvest. Politics must be superseded by management in the social
and business sense of the term. That is to say, the outcome of a relationship
or a business contract – and the plus value generated by human cooperation
– should be managed, not only for the sake of the participants, but for the
sake of the relationship itself and of what it brings to society and to
mankind and the Earth, the vast planetary organism in which mankind
should perform a definite function, just as the vegetable and the animal
kingdoms, the winds and the sea, do perform.
If a seventh house relationship is truly functional and purposeful, it is in
the field of experiences related to the eighth house that this functional
purpose finds itself substantiated. As it is substantiated and takes on a very
concrete character, the partners must face up to the responsibility of
whatever it is that the relationship brings to other persons, and especially to
the whole community and to the Earth.
The cooperative activity of a couple or of a group produces various
results, releases new energies, or creates new wealth. How are the fruits of
this activity to be used? This is the basic eighth house question because this
house is a succeedent house and all such houses – second, fifth, eighth, and
eleventh – deal with the use of the power made available by what occurred
in the angular houses – first, fourth, seventh, and tenth. In the second house
an individual uses what he owns, and a certain kind of personal
management is implied. But in the field of business, proper management
takes on a superpersonal meaning, that is, the manager uses the fruits of
group activity not for himself, but for the relationship between the group
participants – thus for the firm, the government, the nation as a whole.
Responsibility means the ability to respond. Respond to what? To the
conjugal or social situation created by the concrete results of a cooperative
relationship. This means the ability to control, handle, and put to
constructive social purposes the fruits of this relationship.
This responsibility applies to all levels of seventh house activity – to
sexual activity as well as to business profits, or losses! Power is released. It
may be substantiated as the conception of a baby, or as both monetary gains
and the pollution of air and water by an industrial enterprise. Every release
of power can be both positive and negative – most often it is a little of both.
Is the business profitable? What legacy does it leave for the future? And
this means, above all, the future of the participants, for any relationship entered into and any signed contractual agreement will bring a legacy to the
participants. It could mean death to the past followed by rebirth, or the kind
of dying which surrounds the future with karmic ghosts and unresolved
frustrations.
The eighth house is a very important house, but one that is hard to
interpret in an individual's chart. It is in terms of eighth house types of
experience that a person has to make perhaps his or her deepest and most
vital choices. These choices will affect not only the individual, but society
as a whole. In that sense, the Existentialist philosophers are right in saying
that every man is responsible for the whole of mankind. THE NINTH HOUSE
Exploring Possibilities for Expansion
The Development of Understanding and the Use of Symbols
The Dangers of Over-expansion in Individuals and Society
Experiences related to the ninth house are essentially those encountered by
an individual in the course of his search for the meaning of things. This
House, being a “cadent” House, also refers specifically to matters which
enable partnerships and all kinds of group activity to operate most
successfully and to expand within the framework of a particular society and
culture. This requires a knowledge of the over-all conditions, procedures,
and laws which structure a particular society's way of life and the
possibilities this way of life presents for success and expansion. The ninth
house is traditionally the house of philosophy and religion, but it also deals
with all legal matters. It refers in general to whatever expands a person's
field of activity or the scope of his mind – long journeys, close contacts
with other cultures and with foreigners in general, and those “great dreams”
which reveal to the open consciousness facing life-changes the meaning of
past, present, and expectable events as well as the trends of individual and
collective destiny. Experiences with seers, prophets, fortunetellers, futureoriented statisticians, extrapolators, etc., also come within this ninth house
field.
The ninth house opposes and complements the third house. While the
third house refers to the need of an individual to come to terms with, and
thus to know and understand, his close and personal environment, the ninth
house is an area in which he seeks to discover the significance of larger
fields of social existence which he may not experience directly but which his mind may explore through the use of analogy, generalization, and
abstraction. These two houses symbolize the two polarities of the human
mind, the concrete and the abstract. Any fully developed mind operates in
terms of a combination of both types of thinking, but nearly everyone will
tend to favor one over the other. In our analytical and empirical age, the
man with a scientific bent will naturally focus his attention on third house
experiences; Louis Pasteur typifies this trend, as his birth chart reveals a
complex aggregation of planets in the third house.
On the other hand, the metaphysician or the philosopher whose function
is to synthesize data and to discover general principles could be expected to
have a full natal ninth house. Such an expectation, however, is not too often
justified, because planets in a house do not necessarily indicate that the
individual will have outstanding experiences or produce great things in
terms of what the house represents. A planet in a house indicates that the
function signified by this planet should be used to its best advantage in
dealing with the experiences to which the house refers; it should be used
because problems will arise in that field of experience which can best be
solved in this way. Where, however, there is no great problem in that field
because the person is spontaneously able to handle what he finds there, the
house may well be empty. One must look for another kind of indication in
the zodiacal sign at the cusp of the house or in its ruler. The presence of the
Moon's nodes may be significant and, as always, the whole chart has to be
considered, for sometimes what seems to be an outstanding feature in a
person is actually the secondary result of some more basic trait or faculty.
An apparently great thinker may actually be a medium or channel through
whom the collective mind, or even the mind of a partner whose influence
may or may not be consciously acknowledged, operates.
In Albert Einstein's birth chart, Jupiter at Aquarius 27° is in the ninth
house in opposition to Uranus in the third, and Pluto squares Jupiter. This
can be considered remarkably symbolic as well as prophetic. Einstein's
famous formula made possible the atomic bomb, a bomb which uses
uranium and plutonium, the latter element unknown when Einstein was
born and even when he established his Theory of Relativity. But while
Jupiter in the ninth house obviously expanded his capacity for abstract
thinking, and Uranus in the third house made his analytical intellect sharp
and impatient with old concepts, these planets refer just as much to the type of problems he had to face and how he solved them. These problems, of
course, had a great deal to do with social factors – Jupiter – and with his
natal environment, which he had to leave. Jupiter being the ruler of a very
full Piscean tenth house dynamized by the Sun's presence would normally
suggest that he would gain maximum professional and public influence in a
foreign country.
In matters concerning the mind of an individual, one should always
differentiate between “knowledge” and “understanding.” The act of
knowing belongs to the third house because it implies merely the direct
contact of a person with something in his environment. Knowledge can be
derived directly from sensations or, in a psychological and mystical sense,
from an equally direct and as incontrovertible inner perception or
realization. Understanding is a far more complex process because it
involves the synthesis of many factors and known data. It is the result of a
holistic process which actually implies as a background the experience of a
people and their culture. One does not, strictly speaking, “know” the
meaning of anything; the experience of meaning comes from
understanding.
A synonym for understanding is comprehension. To comprehend
something is to apprehend a togetherness of factors on which that thing
depends for its existence and its behavior. In the deepest sense, to
understand something or someone is to take into consideration the
relationship of this thing or this person to the whole universe. You may
“know” that a person committed a crime, but you can “understand” this
action only by seeing it in its personal, social, and even cosmic – thus
astrological – frame of reference. Newton “knew” that ripe apples fell down
from the apple tree, but he”understood” this only when he could relate it to
a universal law, gravitation. The most difficult form of understanding, of
course, is one which refers to an action or a person in which the knower is
personally involved.
The complex nature of the process of understanding and of the search
for meaning leads in most cases to the use of symbols. The ninth house is
the house of symbols. All words are symbols. Most gestures are symbols
being consciously or unconsciously enacted. The mating dances of birds are
symbols, and so are the human acts and body attitudes in courtship. All arts
are symbolic, even if the artist refuses to admit this in his preoccupation with what he calls “objectivity” or random elements. This preoccupation in
some modern artists and musicians is in itself a symbolic expression of a
particular phase in a culture, and the artistic results symbolize such a phase.
The clairvoyant who is asked to solve a client's problem usually visualizes a
symbolic object or scene, or hears within his or her brain words which are
also symbols.
Symbols have to be interpreted. Each individual interprets them in terms
of what he is, what he knows, or what he feels – and/or has personally felt
in the past – against the background of his culture and family tradition. A
birth chart is a symbol as well. It symbolizes the complex relationship
existing between a newborn organism and the universe. Likewise all
religious concepts and mystical visions are symbolic of such a man-touniverse relationship. To speak of a “God experience” – a typical ninth
house experience – is an awkward way of symbolizing in a word, God, the
“feel” of the so-called “unitive” experience in which the whole universe is
reduced to a unity upon which the person projects the answer to all his
conceivable needs.
This does not mean that God does not exist! The very fact that we know
we are surrounded by a multiplicity of objects, motions, energies makes it
necessary for us, or at least for some human beings, to conceive or to feel
the existence of an opposite factor, unity. The metaphysician may
understand this fact, and its inevitable consequences, in terms of mental
concepts, and he may formulate a cosmology or theology. The devotee and
the mystic, in probably two different ways, feel it, and experience it as a
consciousness-transforming intuition so realistic that it takes shape as some
kind of Presence. But the word, unity, and the embodied Presence are
nevertheless symbols. The whole universe, as we perceive it, is a symbol of
our human and individual stage of evolution. This is why the Hindu
philosopher called it maya, a word usually but not adequately translated as
“illusion.” Symbols are not illusions! They are projections of what we are,
generically, collectively, and individually. But we need them in order to
operate as human beings. They are the expressions of the quality of human
togetherness at any particular time and place.
What we call “the law” is also such a symbolic expression. The laws of
a society reveal the basic character of the togetherness of its members – and
often the ideal rather than the actual quality of a particular way of life. Social reality often gives the lie to the ideals embodied in laws. Yet from
the point of view of a business operation, or even of a conjugal relationship,
these laws must be “known” – the ninth house is a third house starting from
the Descendant, principle of relationship–even if they are to be
circumvented. The ninth house represents the environment of the
relationship, just as the third house represents the environment of the self.
Knowledge of conditions in any environment enables one to function as
successfully as possible.
In this sense knowledge is power, or rather knowledge is the way to
achieve power. And while power at the personal level is represented by the
fourth house, at the social level it is a tenth house matter.
The danger one faces in terms of ninth house experiences is overexpansion caused by ambition and greed for power or the symbol of social
power, money. Ambition is the negative aspect of understanding, for it
implies a compulsive egocentric approach to human relationships. The
ambitious egocentric person uses relationships to increase his power and/or
prestige; he makes a relationship his servant, and those to whom he relates
slaves to his purpose. Thus the relationship is perverted and eventually
becomes at least potentially destructive of the harmonious and wholesome
life of the greater whole – the society or the planet itself.
I stated above that selfhood and relatedness are the two principles basic
to all existence; harmonious and sound living demand their interplay. One
waxes in strength at certain times while the other wanes, and vice versa. But
each should retain its true nature. When one of them succeeds in
adulterating the character or the essential purpose of the other, human life
takes on a discordant, tense and inherently destructive quality. The
disharmonic process begins in most cases in terms of third house
experiences, that is, because of destructive environmental pressures or
shocks to the sensibility, the nervous system, or the personal mind. It may
be focused further in the fourth and fifth houses, as the personality of the
growing individual becomes frozen in fear, distrust, or resentment and he
experiences repeated frustration in his efforts toward self-expression. Then,
he learns through sixth house experiences that the basic choice left to him is
between being a master or being a slave. As a result, he can no longer
experience love, sharing, trust; so he begins to act within groups and with
his partners in terms of greed; he seeks to hoard the power generated by society and by group relationship. This may mean amassing a large amount
of capital as a means to reach the top level in society, and it implies twisting
the laws – natural as well as political – so they become tools for his rise.
In such cases there is no question of harmonic understanding, only of
the kind of knowledge which serves ego ambition. It is knowledge that can
be used against the harmonious fulfillment of relationship, against love. It
is the knowledge of a perverted mind, or it may even be the knowledge
gained by researchers who seek knowledge merely for its own sake and in
the process add to their personal fame. It is knowledge in which wisdom is
absent, knowledge which does not consider the end results of what is
known and formulated for general and nondiscriminating social-political
use. Indeed, it is the kind of knowledge that our society holds in high
esteem because ours is a society imbued with the competitive and ambitious
spirit, worshipping success and power with no concern for the means used
or for what these means have done to the quality of the relationships which
made possible the rise to power of the ego-centered individual.
In such a society the mind all too readily becomes an instrument which
tells how to use the energy released by group relationship and cooperation –
often compulsive cooperation – to achieve success. This is the mind of the
politician, and of the black magician as well, for magic was the original
way in which human energies could be used for a group purpose. The
purpose may be one of healing or of providing the group with whatever is
vital to its existence or spiritual growth. In such a case one speaks of “white
magic.” When, however, the motivation for the use of group power comes
from group ambition or from the greed of the leader, when it is based on
hate, or rooted in fear, then it is “black magic.”
The eighth house field of experience witnesses the release of collective
group power, whether physical or psychic – occult. In the ninth house one
learns the laws and the techniques which make such a release truly
effective. In the tenth house the power itself is experienced in a focused
state; it has become a social force, for better or for worse. THE TENTH HOUSE
Social Position, Prestige and Achievement
The Use and Misuse of Social Power
The Myth of Individual Success
In the fourth house having acquired an at least instinctive realization of
what life and his ancestry have made available for him to use – second
house – as well as a knowledge of what his environment allows and gives
him opportunities to do – third house – the individual learns to stabilize and
organize his energies in terms of what he experiences to be basic factors in
his personality. He finds out where he belongs in the narrow field of his
family, an what stand, instinctively or consciously, he has to take as a
person. His character takes on definite form; out of the depth of his being
and as a result of the interplay of all his organic functions, he experiences
power, or – if he has been conditioned by weaknesses or frightening or
chaotic environment – powerlessness.
In the tenth house the individual meets experiences which result from
the fact he has succeeded, or failed, in gaining a social position – that is, a
place in the complex ritual of social, public, or professional activities. He is
integrated, or fails to become integrated, into the greater whole in which he
has learned, or failed to learn, to participate cooperatively. He has a place, a
definite function, a public status in his community. Because of this status he
has some degree of social power, which in our society primarily implies
money but in other societies might mean other factors also related to social
or communal power and prestige. In the broadest sense the term office
implies a function or role which an individual performs together with other
individuals. He is an “officiant” in a vast collective ritual. It is this “office” which defines his stand in the community as well as what he has been able
to achieve as an individual.
The tenth house is the house of achievement. A series of gradual
developments, in which seventh house relationships are particularly
important, comes to a head (”head” is in Latin caput, from which the word,
achievement, is derived). These developments were potentialities within the
original impulse, or logos – “word” – which the Ascendant symbolizes.
First house potential theoretically becomes actualized fully in the tenth
house, if all has gone well during the process of actualization which is full
of pitfalls, obstacles, and possibilities of losing one's way.
The individual and the social position he comes to fill are, in a sense,
polar opposites, as are the fourth and tenth houses. They should
complement each other, as all opposites are meant to do. The combination
of the right person with the office most meaningful to him constitutes the
consummation of human existence, at all levels of activity. Such a
consummation is rather rarely attained in our present-day anarchic society,
which may explain the often visible contrast between the qualitative value
of the person and the character of the office he fills. A man may find what
he calls his “vocation” – a tenth house realization – but this does not
guarantee that he will have passed satisfactorily through the testing process
which allows him, and others involved in the process, to see whether or not
he is actually ready for an effectual discharge of the duties of the office to
which such a vocation points. In the tenth house an individual is judged by
the only test that is existentially significant: the proof of works.
Can the individual, who believes he has a vocation, perform? To perform is to act through and in terms of a definite form. A pianist performs a
composition according to what the musical score demands, not only in
terms of muscular virtuosity but of psychological maturity and
understanding – ninth house characteristics. Is the would-be officiant truly
able to fill significantly the office to which his vocation has drawn him?
Can he be trusted with the power inherent in the office?
Any social office – any job or professional activity which has an organic
and integral function in a community – provides the officiant with social
power. The tragedy inherent in our individualistic and supposedly
democratic social system is that the performance of a social function
releases its power largely, and often exclusively, in the form of money, and money is an abstract form of social power which can be hidden,
manipulated, used for any purpose, and thus inorganically used. Sexual and
emotional power which builds up in the fourth house may also be used
inorganically and for abstract and unrealistic ego purposes, but this
egocentric and nerve-stimulating or glamorous use usually leads to satiety
and boredom, or illness. The use of money has practically no limits,
because it comes to mean the use of power – most of all power over people.
And the thirst for power can very rarely be slaked. This is the curse of
money and the meaning it has acquired in capitalist society.
A man in charge of a social office, especially if this office is
indispensable to the welfare of the community, may be confronted with
crucial experiences. Especially if he assumed this function without having
been truly tested, not only for his intellectual and technical skill, but for the
quality of his psychological responses to the type of decision he will have
to make, the individual may lack the love and cooperative will – seventh
house – the sense of responsibility – eighth house – and the understanding
– ninth house – necessary to the performance of his tasks. The results of
such a situation are often tragically demonstrated by the behavior of
policemen and Army men as well as of many Congressmen, senators, and
presidents.
In a truly “organic” democracy, the misuse of the power given to a
person by virtue of his office should be considered more criminal than the
misuse of purely personal energies, especially under emotional stress or
physical deprivation, for instance, hunger. Thus if a policeman lacking selfcontrol brutalizes people in a public demonstration, or takes advantage of
his position – and of the fact his testimony will hardly be challenged in a
law court – to blackmail someone whose favors he desires, or to extract
money for “protection,” such a behavior should lead, not to mere dismissal,
but to criminal prosecution. This is a social crime, and as such it is more
destructive of communal health and harmony than a personal crime such as
stealing, or injuring some other person for purely personal reasons. In the
same way, a general who sends his troops off to a useless death or who
shows a clear incapacity for handling a military situation should not only be
demoted, but criminally prosecuted. There can be no excuse for repeated
inefficiency and emotional or stupid inefficiency in the performance of a public function, even if in many cases it is the whole social system and its
procedures for promotion which are largely to be blamed.
No social position should ever be held permanently by any individual,
regardless of his character, or the value and efficiency of his performance;
the security this involves, the protection from dismissal or even prosecution
for irresponsible use of power or authority, is what causes bureaucracies to
become cancerous growths in the body politic. Any public performer would
very soon lose his or her popularity if his or her performance suddenly
revealed deterioration, save possibly in the case of an aging public idol who
has become a kind of historical figure that people long to see before he or
she disappears. Yet a bad artistic performance does not necessarily hurt the
community; the conduct of a war or the over-forceful police reaction to a
peaceful public protest does.
The glorification of the individual as an independent and unique fact of
existence obviously has a valid purpose, especially during certain historical
periods. But no person actually stands alone or can achieve the full
actualization of his powers without the cooperation of society. Individual
success is a myth. What succeeds is the society – and ultimately mankind –
through an individual who has developed powers of mind or skills which
are actually the result of the endeavors and struggles of countless preceding
generations. In many instances, of course) a man reaches power and success
only by crushing or despoiling many other human beings.
An individual who has reached a certain degree of efficiency in his
social or official performance very often may experience frustration and
enmity because the system – the Establishment – refuses to be transformed
in spite of glaring inefficiencies and obsolescence. Social structures and
institutions have a tremendous amount of inertia, that is, of resistance to
change, and conflicts inevitably arise between them and individuals who
have come to feel, love, think, and understand in terms of a new and more
adequate level of relationship. These conflicts then lead to eleventh house
type of experiences.
When in the above paragraphs I have spoken of a society and social
values, I was not referring to any particular social system, institution, or
cultural standards. It is not “the system” in itself or any particular kind of
performance which was discussed, but the relationship between an
individual or a small group and society as a whole. The particular kind of social system in which a man lives may be dehumanizing or archaic, or a
perversion of a beautiful original ideal; then the individual person may seek
with valid reasons to transform or overthrow it. No individual, however, can
significantly improve, reform, or transform what he is not personally and
effectively involved in. In the tenth house field of activities he becomes
involved, and he experiences the results of his involvement. And he has to
be involved, whether or not he consciously accepts the reality of it. Even
the yogi meditating in a mountain cave is involved, often very consciously
and powerfully, but sometimes in a negative way. Northern Buddhism
scorned the Pratyeka Buddhas who sought to reach Nirvana alone, with no
concern whatever for the fate of the rest of mankind. What can be reached
in this way is only an illusory Nirvana; in a new cycle the deserter will be
forced to meet the karma of his “spiritual selfishness.” There can be no
realistic achievement that is not achievement within humanity, and
essentially in terms of human evolution as a whole.
The cusps of the tenth house – the Mid-heaven – is one of the four
angles of the birth chart. As we saw in Part One of this book, Mid-heaven
of the usual astrological chart is not the real Zenith; that is a point in the
Sky just above the head of a man standing erect on the surface of our globe.
It is rather the point at which the meridian – a great circle which passes
through the actual Zenith and Nadir – cuts the ecliptic, that is, the plane of
the apparent annual motion of the Sun in the Sky from one vernal equinox
to the next. The Mid-heaven is therefore a “solar” factor. It refers to
vitalistic processes. It represents the consummation of organic and
communal functions. It is significant mostly where a society operates in
terms of biological values and of strictly natural rhythms, typically an
agricultural society.
When a man reaches a state of true individualization and is able to
operate as an autonomous and authentic self, his consciousness should be
able not only to function or participate in a life-oriented community and in
biospheric activities, but to contact a transcendent field of experience and a
superphysical type of energies. According to the new level of astrological
symbolism, this field is that of the stars – that is, of galactic space. As a
man stands erect, his spinal column becomes a section of a line which
through him links the center of the Earth and one particular star exactly above his head. This star is potentially a great symbol; it represents that
man's spiritual identity, his “place” in the vast galaxy.
Today in astronomical practice it is not possible to identify such a star,
and perhaps it is best that this should be the case, considering man's present
stage of evolution. Moreover, should we be able to determine this star we
would not know what symbolic meaning or character to give to it. Yet
potentially the star exists. If we see the galaxy as “the Womb of Souls,” as
the ancients did, then there is in this vast cosmic matrix one star that
represents our unrealized and unembodied “Soul.” Its “ray” passes through
us when we stand in the tallness of our innermost selfhood. It is the symbol
of our cosmic office, and that of the Mastery which each individual
someday may come to realize and to allow to incarnate in his transformed
total person.
The Mastery seeks the one who will embody its qualities and its power
in consciousness and in transpersonal deeds. The great office seeks the
officiant who would both fulfill his natal potentialities in the required
performance, and at the same time become a totally self-consecrated agent
and servant of its purpose. Two movements are present in the true
consummation of an individualized person: the man aspires to, works
toward, dedicates himself consciously and irrevocably to the purpose of a
social – and eventually a planetary and cosmic – function. At the same time
a complementary and synchronous “descent” of the archetype – or divine
Idea – which this function expresses takes place to meet the individual
person's “ascent.” The Mastery meets the Master-to-be, and in this meeting
Heaven unites with Earth, God with a man who thereby becomes an
immortal aspect of Man.
This is the Transfiguration process, on the Mount where the Son of God
and the Son of Man become one. The star above blends its rays with the
tone of the self within the human heart. THE ELEVENTH HOUSE
The Release of Collective Power through the Individual's Participation
in Groups
The Creative Uses of Success and Failure
Rebellion and the Process of Social Change
Just as the fifth house refers to the release of powers which were tapped in
the fourth house, so the eleventh house deals with the forms which the
powers manifesting in the tenth house phase may take as they are released.
The energies and faculties concentrated in the fourth house find their
expression through mechanisms developed in the fifth house: procreative or
creative activities, emotional outpourings of self, risk-taking and all kinds
of daring, dramatic gestures in which the individual functions in solitary
splendor or as a master of men and conditions. The fifth house is the house
of the cosmic autocrat, the Sun, who pours him self into space in effulgent
glory, and rigidly controls the motion) of his planets.
In the eleventh house the power of society, of the collectivity or the
group, is released through the individual. More exactly this power is
released through the activities the individual performs within the social unit
– nation, class, church, club, professional group – to which he belongs. As
he succeeds in establishing himself as a participant in society, the individual
is able subsequently to operate creatively or pleasurably in the social
environment his work or his prestige opens up to him. The experience he
has gained in the tenth house makes it possible for him to set new social
objectives or new professional goals for himself, or to relax in the company
of his fellow workers and friends. If this tenth house experience is vital and
he meets it with real power and in real openness to the needs of the situation which confronts him, he develops a new vision, new ideals, and concrete
plans for social or professional improvement. If his participation in the life
of society has been superficial, passive, or based purely on the enjoyment of
privilege, he is likely to seek one type or another of social escape, from tea
parties to night-club follies, in the company of like-minded friends.
We saw in preceding chapters that the meridian can be considered the
axis of power, while the horizon represents the axis of consciousness. In the
fourth house, power is drawn by the individual unconsciously, or in purely
subjective consciousness, out of the matrix of race, family, tradition, or
environment. It is thereafter worked upon and personalized by the
individual. It is power that wells up from the roots, from the soil, and
ultimately from the center of our globe, which is the sustaining foundation
of all humanity. Tenth house power results from the shared participation
which has taken form in the seventh house, become productive in the
eighth, and reached in the ninth the preliminary depth of understanding
required to insure a valid framework for the building of civilization.
Tenth house activities provide this framework or blueprint. In the tenth
house, the Indian caste system, the economic and mercantile patterns of the
Roman Empire, the guilds of the Free Cities of the late Middle Ages, the
“planned society” of many a tomorrow, are established on the foundations
of the laws discovered in the ninth house. But a pattern or framework must
be filled with substance and vitality. The power of the human personality,
alone or in groups must be released in and through these plans. Law and
ritual alone do not make a civilization. The interaction of many individuals
keeps the workshop of civilization running. But just as a home without
progeny – be it biological or spiritual – is but a structure, a society without
the creative vision and the means to release the power of creative
individuals is a spiritless structure which must in time disintegrate.
But what is the substance of that creative vision, and how does it grow
in the minds and souls of individuals?
In discussing the meaning of the meridian, and of the Zenith, I said that
the meridian is also to be considered as the line formed by a man's spine
when he is standing straight. This erect spine is the “I” made concrete and
operative. It is the signature of man's ego power and his individual strength
and responsibility. One of the poles of the meridian is the center of the
globe – and beyond it lie all the unconscious forces of the inner life. The other is the star which shines at the Zenith of the individual's life. Rooted in
center, a star on his forehead, the individualized and conscious human being
becomes an agent for the release of the creative power of the vertical axis of
all life, root and seed.
In the fifth house, root forces are active. In the eleventh house the new
seed is being formed. And this new seed, in the human kingdom, is more
than a mere duplicate of the seed of yesteryear. It is a new seed because
man has the power to add constantly to his vision and to his creation. All
yesteryears can be combined by creative man into a new tomorrow which
need not repeat today.
In the words of Count Korzybski, the human kingdom has developed
the power to bind time. Man can add to himself constantly because he can
remember. Remembering, he can record his experiences and his deductions;
recording, he can transfer what he has gained to new generations, which in
their turn will do the same. Thus there is a constant process of accumulation
and synthesis at work in humanity, and this is what is meant by civilization.
There may be periodic Dark Ages, but even in these relatively “dark” eras
civilization is retained in seed. Records are kept – in caves, in monasteries,
through word of mouth. The flame of civilization does not die. No
generation need start from nothing. Revolutions destroy the upper crust of
society, but here and there a few remember and pass on their knowledge to
avidly seeking minds. And lo! Russia, whose aristocracy and intelligentsia
had been wiped out, arose in less than two decades to astonish the world
with its initiatives in war and in peace.
What does this mean? It means symbolically that the stars at the Zenith
continue to shine and to invest in creative individuals, who have learned in
the seventh house the secret of “shared participation,” the power of the
celestial Company of the Seed. Humanity is an organic Whole. Humanity
lives in its total essence as a firmament, as a galaxy. The “dead” as much as
the “living” – and in a sense perhaps also the “unborn” – constitute a
creative Host. Man is that Host. It operates through and fecundates with
vision those individuals who are clear and strong enough, dedicated and
powerful enough, to carry the burning torch of civilization.
In the eleventh house every individual's star of destiny, which shines at
the Zenith of his living, becomes a vibrant source of power in actual
operation. The realizations that fill the tenth house phase of experience are largely conditioned by what occurred during the seventh, eighth, and ninth
house phases. When the Zenith is reached, however, some new power
fecundates the sum total of these last mentioned phases. This new power is
the power of the greater collectivity, of human society, of the nation, of the
universal Whole. It is the power of the stars, symbolically speaking. And
that power descends from above and crowns the individual who is fulfilling
to the best of his ability his function in the work of the world. It is the
“tongue of fire” which descended upon every apostle at Pentecost. It is the
Holy Ghost. It is celestial power – the power of the community, the power
of the Church, the power of God, when God is conceived as the soul and
wholeness of the universal Whole.
This power that descends from above operates in the eleventh house as
creative vision. Here, the substance of every creative tomorrow is gathered
and vivified by the power of the constellation at the Zenith. Here, creative
destiny is fashioned by brave hands and farseeing minds. Here at work is
the elan vital which forever generates universes, the powerful and
unpredictable surge of creative evolution which spots forth tomorrows in
spiritual and creative freedom.
Astrologers have often identified all creative processes with the fifth
house. But in the fifth house it is the individual who creates, strictly as an
individual or as the head of a home, and his creation is essentially based on
biological factors. In the eleventh house it is the Whole-that creates through
the individual, fulfilling its function in the economy of the Whole. It is
creation, not of the individual, but through the individual. Christ – the
universal Spirit – acts then through the transfigured humanity of Jesus. This
action, then, releases the power of the Christ, the power of the Whole – the
power which, if there is not to be stagnation and crystallization, must
periodically renew the substance and form of the organism. It is action
without personal concern for the fruits of this action. It is the only truly
creative and free kind of action. The individual becomes a clear lens
focusing Light and projecting upon all virgin soils the image of the Sun, or
the celestial harmony of the Brotherhood of the stars.
Traditional astrology speaks feebly of the eleventh house as the house
of “hopes and wishes.” How weak a conception for one of the most vibrant
of all the houses! It is a Medieval concept for in a society completely ruled
by biological and feudal patterns what else could the submerged individual, the “sinner,” do but “hope and wish” for a better future? The only way open
for a more creative action was to become a member of a Brotherhood, and
thus to participate in secret in the creative impulses of humanity. It meant
banding together with friends, with companions fired by a similar yearning
for vision and creative social or religious change.
It still means today the communion of the few who together constitute
the seed of a new day. In this communion there is power, and this power
alone is a guarantee of immortality, or the ability to become always
different while remaining the same. In the twelfth house the seed will
perform the ultimate sacrifice in order to make possible a new world. In the
eleventh house it gathers power around itself. It brings to a focus within its
walls the universal and creative power of life. Life always wins in the end.
Yet many are the seeds that perish and become manure for the future. To
dream and to fashion ideals is not enough. The eleventh house is a house of
activated and concretized power.
If now we look at eleventh house matters from a more psychological
point of view we find that the type of experiences normally to be met in
terms of this house have much to do with an individual's attitude toward
achievement and social success, or the lack of them. Let us say that a man
has struggled eagerly and persistently to achieve something, and he has
obtained his goal. He has fulfilled his ambition and is rewarded for his
efforts by a social position, and perhaps prestige or even fame. What will he
do with his success? Or if he has failed to reach the desired goal, what will
he be able to make out of his failure?
The eleventh house is a succeedent house and, as we saw, the keynote of
these houses is the word use. Failure can be used creatively as well as
success, and often more easily. Success as well as failure must be used
wisely, significantly, and creatively. It is the use a person makes of either
achievement or failure which establishes his worth. If a person proves in the
tenth house that he can fulfill satisfactorily a public function, in the eleventh
house he has to show – to himself as well as to his friends – what this
success has brought to his total being, to the way he lives, feels, and acts in
his social circle. Or he must be able to show whether he has the courage and
stamina to learn from and rise above his failure.
Success or failure can be used imaginatively and creatively only if one
has not become entirely identified with the struggle for achievement. The average “man of action” unfortunately identifies closely with his activity. If
he succeeds, he becomes a prisoner of the social pattern that defines what is
expected of him; his efforts to reach the top usually have conditioned him to
identify with the established character of his social or professional role and
with the interests and way of life of all those who belong to his class or
group. He has obtained what he wished; he has found friends in terms of his
social-professional achievements. Perhaps he has joined a certain club, has
learned to enjoy certain types of cultural activities, belongs to a political
party or fraternal organization which is open to him because of his success,
but he must always be on his toes, for this party or organization must be
courted in order to achieve more, to produce more, to grow bigger and
bigger.
If, on the other hand, a man has been frustrated in his endeavors or
defeated by a system which he comes to despise or loathe, he finds friends
among men and women who share his attitude of discontent and
resentment. He then becomes a rebel, perhaps an activist and revolutionary.
Or he may simply be a man fired with a zeal for reform, the kind of liberal
reform he hopes to accomplish within the framework of his profession, or
of the legal possibilities provided by some sort of implicit if not explicit
“Constitution.”
The type of ideals for which an individual works as a reformer or a
revolutionary may have been built through various kinds of experiences – in
his early environment, at home, with his loved ones, in a national military
service, with partners and co-workers, through contacts with alien cultures
or inspired religious men, and while performing his social-professional
duties. Indeed, every area of activity – every house of his birth chart – can
be involved. But the eleventh house type of experiences deal specifically
with the exteriorization of a man's ideals in relation to people who share
these ideals. These people become his companions; they are “friends”
operating within a social-professional setup, or fighting against it. This is,
strictly speaking, what friends are, for friendship – in this eleventh house
sense at least – is not based as much on purely personal attachments – fifth
or seventh house types of relationship – as it is on a shared and effectively
used orientation which means either the enjoyment of collective patterns or
a revolt against them. A rebellious attitude or a deep discontent with the status quo results
from a basic problem inherent in all tenth house conditions. Essentially this
is the difficulty of reconciling or satisfactorily adjusting two opposite
factors in any social situation which has become stabilized or even
crystallized, giving rise to formalism, bureaucratic routine, and privileges.
On the one hand there is the value of individual freedom and personal
initiative or imagination and on the other the established requirements of
the office itself and the drive to perfection in any public performance. The
problem may be solved in a negative manner when society seeks to enslave
the individual to his office – making of him a depersonalized cog in a
machine – or when the individual comes to consider the power and
authority of his office as his own, to be used as he wishes. The results of
these negative solutions to tenth house problems condition eleventh house
experiences. They may produce rebelliousness or abuses of power and
wealth which in turn lead to the revolt of the less favored and resentful
underdogs.
As I have said, all social institutions develop a powerful resistance to
change. Yet change they must, when their negative products have become
unbearable. These products may be physically, psychologically, or
spiritually unbearable. In any case, a universal process – the change of any
overly dominant trend into its opposite – cannot be arrested. Men and
women arise who embody such a process of radical repolarization of social
values and, in most cases, of destruction of institutions and privileged
groups or classes. These men and women are the Promethean spirits who
incarnate the Uranian power of relentless metamorphosis – a power assisted
by Neptunian compassion and the devastation of Plutonian catharses which
leave nothing untouched, no idol left standing. They are the iconoclasts, but
they are also the great dreamers of often premature transformations. They
are usually persecuted; they may experience martyrdom, and perhaps
rebirth.
The eleventh house is followed by the twelfth, and once more by a new
banning in a first house experience of creation. The absolutely full must be
emptied before there can be room for new growth, new contents. Yet the
eternal question remains: How much can be saved of the old? What was the
now crystallized and rigid pattern worth when it was fresh and vital? How
can one save the seed, the spiritual harvest of experiences of the past? To answer this question, a sharp, penetrating, intense, yet objective inquiry into
the fundamental value of much that a society has so long taken for granted
is necessary. The historian endowed with a holistic vision and a sense of
structural developments has to cooperate with the emotional and passionate
muckraker. Both operate in terms of eleventh house activity, but in different
ways. Both are needed at the close of a cycle.
There are men and women whose task it is to dramatize discontent and
protest; some of them no doubt enjoy tragedy and seek revolution as a way
of life; poets and novelists find fame in baring the sordid and decadent,
even within themselves. This way too is necessary, for the inertia of the
average person is truly appalling and somehow has to be “earth-quaked.”
But the deeper process is always, symbolically speaking, that of
transforming a circle into a spiral – that is, of making it impossible for
history to repeat itself. A point moving in a circular way will return exactly
to its initial position, but if it follows a spiral pattern the return takes place
at a higher level or in terms of a broader – and hopefully more harmonious
– inclusiveness. Greater inclusiveness is a disturbing challenge to privilege
and exclusive possession; thus the struggle goes on. And the great key to
victory and progress is the conquest of fear. The greatest fear may be that of
losing one's precious identity as an individual ego. In all “succeedent”
houses the negative aspect of life as a relatively isolated being has to be
surrendered.
The “pure breath” of potential individuality, related to the Ascendant,
clings to its isolated status and to its proud craving for originality. It must
surrender at least some of its claim when it has to use materials which a
long line of ancestors have built or refined – second house – materials
which, as a spiritual factor, it felt to be inferior and merely to be used as it
wished. In the fifth house, the experience of emotional desire or passion and
of caring for a progeny can mean a surrender of ego pride, the giving up of
security, home, rootedness – fourth house matters. In the eighth house type
of experience the bliss of the honeymoon – seventh house – fades out, as its
exclusivism and glamour are rudely challenged by cooperative
requirements and the pressures of the marketplace.
Finally in the eleventh house, the show of success, the special power
and privilege of position – tenth house – when they feed pride and pomp,
must be surrendered if the individual is to face reality and to accept the possibility of rebirth. He can maintain his position for a long or a short
time, but everything based on exclusive possession, pride, and selfglorification through the selfish use of social power faces inevitable decay
and death – a death which, when the time comes, will direct a heavy karmic
host toward the new birth. The moment of choice is known through
experiences which belong to the eleventh house, but that choice has been
conditioned by crucial experiences related to the second, the fifth, and the
eighth houses. The cadent houses, then, witness the outcome of these
choices. In the twelfth house we find the final result, the seed of all future
Karma. THE TWELFTH HOUSE
Closing a Cycle of Human Experience
Preparation for a Rebirth
Finding the Courage to Let Go of the Past
The twelfth house closes the cycle of human experience. It is the last stage
in a process which may be repeated during the lifetime of an individual, or
terminated by what we call death. In the twelfth house the individual either
consolidates his successes into the seed of a new cycle of growth, or he
meets the accumulated results of his failures. Indeed, there is practically no
man who has not achieved some kind of success and experienced personal
or social defeats. In the last house of the cycle, man is unavoidably
confronted by his successes and failures. His memories of the past,
conscious or unconscious, crowd over the threshold in front of the new
cycle. They are Angels of Light beckoning to the beyond, or they are dark
Guardians of the Threshold, whose features are shaped by his frustrations,
his denials of life, his fears, his sins of omission as well as commission. The
individual must face this compound entity which he himself has created. He
must go through it, whatever the cost – if there is to be for him a new cycle.
Nevertheless, there must always be a new cycle, even if it is one that
follows the loss of the physical body. Thus there is no real escape from the
confrontation. Still, the conscious ego that is bent upon beginning, or is
fated to begin a new cycle of life in the same body, usually comes to believe
that he can escape the ghostly shapes crowding at the gates of rebirth. He
struggles frantically in the dark, unable to accept or to bless, to redeem or to
overcome. Tormented with pain at the memory of his failures, or oppressed
by fears of what the new cycle will bring, he cries for help and light. And help does come – but often unnoticed, for he may be blinded by the
darkness and haunted by the ticking of the clock of time, which seems
always to run too slow or too fast.
Yet this darkness can be borne if man realizes that only by letting go of
the lesser is it possible to be born into the greater. There is light, too, at the
core of the seed which waits for the promise of renewal inherent in spring,
but this light is a strange and disconcerting glow which makes all things
take unexpected shapes and all events become mysteriously symbolic. It is
such a strange light because it seeps through the fog of the accumulated past
from a far-away reality. The Universal flashes its signals to the particular
man; the Whole bathes the part in a sea of new life-giving blood. Under this
light our limited concepts shine with an all-inclusive vision of life, like dark
rocks transfigured by ultraviolet rays into fantasies of color.
The twelfth house should be understood, above all, as the last phase of
the semi-cycle which began in the seventh house. In the twelfth house the
realm of the Sky ends. It is in this above-the-horizon realm that man's
experiences find themselves centered around the feeling of participation in
society, or in a universe of all-encompassing Spirit. Participation in the
social or universal Whole has become definitely and concretely established
in the tenth house, at the Zenith. The energy produced by such a
participation has been released, in the eleventh house. The power of the
group has flowed through the individual, as this individual performed his
social or professional work. If the tenth house experiences have been vital
and squarely met, the individual may enjoy the pleasures of culture and
friendship, or he may seek to picture new social ideals, new hopes for a
better future. He may enjoy his present, and he may create new tomorrows
for himself and for all men. The source of such a creative act is the vision
that was born in his communion with the Star shining at the Zenith of his
being, a communion which had to be made real and concrete through
constant work.
While discussing the meaning of the eleventh house I said that in it the
Whole works through the individual so he can fulfill his function in the
economy of this Whole; it is creation, not of the individual – as in the fifth
house – but through him. What, then, of the results of this creation? They
may appear strange to our minds, which are so strongly hypnotized by our
separative idea of what individual selfhood means. If in the eleventh house we have acted as creative agencies through
which the power of society – or of our particular social group – could be
released in the traditional manner as determined by collective ideals,
culture, and religion, then it is only natural that we should have been
influenced, or molded, by the character of these ideals. If we live in a
materialistic, decadent society, and if we have let it act through us without
questioning its validity, can we hope to escape the inevitable fate of such a
society? If we sing and dance in irresponsible pleasure while the world goes
to its doom, must we not feel within our subconscious, if not consciously,
the impact of this doom?
To the individual, the impact of collective destiny is fate. What he must
remember, however, is that in the twelfth house he must face the ultimate,
logical effects of tenth house causes – and, more distantly, of causal factors
going all the way back to the preceding angular houses – first, fourth, and
seventh. In the tenth house we met the needs of society; that is, we chose, or
we were led to a profession, or a social position of some sort. We met these
social needs under the distant – in rare cases the close – guidance of our
Star at the Zenith. We establish our place in the larger pattern of filings.
From here on, the power of this larger social or universal pattern has to be
the dominant influence in our lives. It is dominant whether we accept it
passively, or rebel against it; whether we play the game with our fellow
citizens, or act as reformers, revolutionaries, or criminals.
In the twelfth house we meet the results of our passive conformism, or
our spiritual rebellion. We face the karma of society in a subconscious and
blind manner, or we face our karma as individuals who fought society, for
the sake of our own selfish interests or for the sake of a better world. Either
we go to sleep spiritually, accepting traditions and precedents with comfort,
or we bear the burden and the consequences of our ideals and our efforts to
incorporate our vision among men. In many lives, both these possibilities
are encountered simultaneously in varying proportions.
Just as the fourth, fifth, and sixth houses can be said to represent three
different types of ego expression, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth houses
represent several types of collective expression. And just as the sixth house
denotes a crisis in experience and a transition between the below-thehorizon and above-the-horizon realms, so the twelfth house also denotes a
critical state between two worlds. The individual who has been dominated by social and collective needs is struggling to emerge from the set of
conditions which have bound him to a social or spiritual pattern, and to be
reborn as a new individual. This, too, means repolarization and
reorientation, but not in the same way as in the sixth house, where the
individual has to work through personal conditions and the need for selfdiscipline. In the twelfth house, what is to be met has its source in collective
issues, in national or social fate, in the pressures of society upon the
individual, and of the collective unconscious upon the conscious ego. In
both houses much pain may be experienced, but the pain that comes from
the metamorphosis experienced in the twelfth house has a poignancy and a
quality of inevitability which may make it harder to bear. One has no
recourse against the universe, save to be reborn out of the universe.
The twelfth house contains the seed of that rebirth. This is shown
symbolically in the fact that the horizon – which is the line of demarcation
between the twelfth house and the first house – is curved. However slight it
may be, there is significance in this curvature which bends the cusp of the
first house downward, from the point of view of the twelfth house. We
might say symbolically that the whole weight of the Sky presses upon the
horizon. The Sky imprints upon the soil the seed pattern of the new destiny
and the seed of the future cycle is released from the past. According to the
ancient tradition of Indian philosophy, the last thought held in death
determines the pattern of the future incarnation.
We may think of this merely as a symbolic statement, but its basic truth
can hardly be challenged. Every birth is a new Act of God; but the soil into
which the seed is sown and the very substance of that seed are products of
the past. What is new is neither soil nor seed substance, but the Godbestowed power in the new entity to shape to new ends these conditions
inherited from the past. It is this power which the Ascendant represents,
and which the symbol of the rising degree of the zodiac helps us to
interpret. This power is the real Identity of the individual, if he succeeds in
reaching the state of truly individualized selfhood. It is the mystic Name of
the newborn.
This individual Identity may operate or it may not. The collective power
of the memories accumulated in the twelfth house – what is called karma –
may be so great that it stifles the individual Identity of the newborn, or
drowns out the Tone of the new cycle of the man facing the possibility of rebirth. If this is the case, then the new cycle tends to become no more than
repetition of the old, under only slightly changed conditions, and the power
of the Collective will constantly challenge and perhaps entirely overwhelm
the individual spirit struggling for identity. But if the confrontations
experienced in the twelfth house have been met successfully and the
individual has absorbed and assimilated the darkness represented by the
“Guardian of the Threshold” – the memories and complexes of the personal
and collective Unconscious – then, the Tone of the new cycle can ring out
clearly. The individual, conscious of his true Identity, is able to use for his
purpose of destiny whatever conditions have been inherited from his past
and the past of his race, from his parents and from humanity.
The past must be used if an individual is to tread the path of creative
accomplishment. The creative life is a constant synthesis of past and future
in a radiant present – a synthesis of memories and of goals through a
creative act. It is a life of plenitude and consecration. Individual Identity,
Personality, Love, and Participation in the organic life of the Whole – these
are the cornerstones of the temple of fulfilled manhood and womanhood.
They are the four angles of the birth chart, the glorious cross of human
living.
One of the stranger characteristics of our western civilization has been
its refusal to think and feel in terms of cyclic processes. Such a refusal can
be traced to a decision of the Council of Constantinople in the fifth century
A.D., which prohibited belief in reincarnation and in all similar cyclic
processes; but it is probably inherent in the particular emphasis which
singles out western society and its essential function in the historical
development of mankind, that is, an emphasis upon a definite break from all
traditions of the then ending “vitalistic Ages.” Our civilization has always
emphasized, often with tragic results, man's capacity for transcending his
natural biopsychic state – the state which dominates all instinctual and tribal
forms of social organization, especially those related to agricultural and
cattle-raising occupations – and to effect such a transcending through the
use of intellectual analyses and mental abstractions. This requires
separation of the mind and its organizer, the ego, from natural instincts and,
in a sense, from all natural processes. It impels the ego mind to glorify itself
in opposition to biological demands and to imagine itself supreme ruler of
life functions and their cyclic rhythms. But the mind alone can barely resist these natural drives and biological compulsions, often glamorized as “the
great passion” or under other mythical images; so the Christian religion had
to become its ally in the effort to transcend those life functions dominated
by natural rhythms. This alliance gave rise to an implicit belief in the
availability of only one life in which to achieve the goal of spiritual
transcendence.
Only one short life available for such an achievement! This means that
every moment in life should be strained toward the difficult goal; no time
could be “lost,” no effort spared. In order to succeed, one has to relentlessly
control the energies of one's inner nature as well as of nature in general. All
this inevitably led to considering death as the great tragedy against which
there was no recourse. Dying and living are both parts of the natural cyclic
process, but if man's mind and ambitions or desperate will could to a large
extent control living processes, he seemed helpless to overcome the last and
insurmountable enemy, death. Death had to be postponed at all cost – even
at the cost of other people dying. Here we have the ultimate purpose of
“black magic,” and also of the kind of wars we wage now, not only against
men of other nations or races, but against nature and its ecological balance,
which, in preserving itself, takes no account of what must die and is not
particularly concerned with natural dying.
In India and Tibet some men also have been driven by the will to
transcend nature. But the natural forces they undertook to control and
transcend were instincts and desires within individual persons. The kind of
mind that was being used in this process of transcendence and in all ascetic
practices was not analytical or intellectual, but mainly a holistic,
imaginative, and integrating power within the single individual. It did not
involve social functions and the organization of the communal life, but the
at least relative and mostly inner isolation of the individual from society; in
this isolation he found happiness and peace in being attuned to the cyclic
rhythms of nature. As a result death was not feared, because it was seen to
be no more than a phase of the all-inclusive process of existence. The yogi
sought consciously to experience death in such a manner that dying would
lead, either at once or after a phase of spiritual assimilation, to rebirth – as it
does in nature. This gave rise to the general belief in “reincarnation” which
was personalized for popular consumption but whose universalistic and
personality-transcending meaning Was retained by the wise. If death is not feared and the belief in the availability of “many lives”
for the gradually evolving “soul” or monad is accepted, then a definite
process of conscious preparation for death could be devised. This process
was to be entered into quietly during the last phase of a person's life. Living
and dying were polar opposites, very much like yang and yin, and when the
life polarity had waned to a certain degree, the death polarity would gain
the upper hand. This was the time to prepare for a significant, peaceful, and
noble death.
This, in astrology, is the most positive and beautiful meaning of the
twelfth house. It can refer to experiences which consciously and peacefully
are related to the task of bringing a process of activity to a significant and
not unduly – and especially not unnaturally – prolonged end. This can be,
arid indeed is, a difficult task, not only when related to dying, but whenever
a person tries to bring to a meaningful and convincing conclusion whatever
activity he has undertaken.
Any person who has had to improvise a speech after a dinner party
knows how difficult it is to bring his talk to a convincing and significant
end. When coming to the close of their speech many speakers fumble,
repeat themselves, go from climax to anticlimax, and perhaps at long last let
their words die out wearily and inconclusively. Their listeners by that time
have become tired and their minds promptly dismiss or forget whatever
might have impressed them at some point of the speech. The composer of
music, the dramatist, and the novelist often find the same difficulty when
confronted by the obvious necessity of bringing their works to a conclusion.
It is relatively easy to start something; the natural impulse of life within the
individual, the emotional eagerness to express himself can do the starting –
and the people's attention is not yet well focused or critical at the beginning.
They are warmed up only gradually and will forget how the thing began.
But nature in man will not produce a significant conclusion, worthy of
remembrance. The natural end of everything is exhaustion – one gets
exhausted and so do the people around you. The speech, or the individual
himself, dies rather meaninglessly of old age. Unless the self, the spiritual
being, takes control and, binding up all the loose strings of the great lifelong
effort, gathers the most essential elements into an impressive and revealing
conclusion, there is danger that the great moment will become obscured by
the setting dust of the struggle. Everything that came before may be largely forgotten, but such a
significant end will be unforgettable. It impresses itself upon the mind and
soul of the people who are witnesses to it. Like a seed, it is the last produce,
the consummation of the annual plant's life. The plant dies and the seed
falls to the ground, but it contains within it the power of ever-renewed life.
“Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if
it die, it bringeth forth much fruit” (John 12:24).
Symbolically speaking, every great and significant conclusion to a
prolonged human effort can be a “seed.” Every cycle of experience, as well
as every human life, can end with the release of such a seed. If it does not,
then what remains is only a fleeting memory. The beauty of the flower of
the cycle may be remembered, the leaves may have given shelter and food
to some living creatures who lived more happily because of them; but if
there is no seed, the essence and substance of the cycle of experience, of the
speech, of the life are lost.
The body dies, but the value of the life may remain. It remains in a
social form, in the memory of friends or foes, if the individual has been able
to make a valuable contribution to his community. The value of an Edison
shines forth in every electrical lamp; it has its undertones in any
phonograph recording. But this element of value is not only a social factor.
It is a personal and spiritual factor as well. By living, man adds value to his
soul, for the soul is the granary in which the harvest of all cycles of
experience is stored; this harvest is the very substance of man's eventual
immortality in a spiritual body. When the granary is full, then man reaches
individual immortality. He has overcome death, not by denying it – a futile
gesture – but by learning how to die significantly: to die the death of the
plant which is rich with fertile, life-renewing seed. The only tragic death is
the one that comes in complete meaninglessness and utter weariness or
boredom – that is, in spiritual defeat.
The art of bringing every experience to a creative end is the greatest of
all arts – and perhaps the least practiced in our western world. What this art
demands first of all is the courage to repudiate the “ghosts” of the past. It is
this repudiation that is also called severance. There can be no real freedom
in rebirth without conscious severance from the past, without either the
ability to bring the whole past to a significant and harmonious conclusion,
or the courage to say “finished,” and to dismiss the memory of what one must leave unfinished, unassimilated, unsolved if one is to enter the new
life, the new cycle of experience.
Ghosts linger on, alas, with subtle tenacity in the unconscious – ghosts
of things undone, of words unsaid, of small or big gestures which the heart
and hands could not be made to perform. The speaker who sees from the
clock on the wall that his time is over, that he must bring his speech to an
end, may suddenly remember everything he had meant to say but did not.
Will he try to crowd it all into a jumble of last-minute statements which
would leave his hearers completely confused? Speakers often try this, and
defeat themselves. One must have the courage to dismiss the things unsaid,
the gestures unlived, the love unexperienced, and to make a compelling end
on the basis of what has been done. This takes skill, of course, but even
more it takes courage. It is a peculiar kind of courage, a psychological kind,
but it is courage of the purest type and often far more difficult to summon
than the strength to die well in the excitement of battle. The nature of this
courage is usually neither recognized nor well understood. It is not an
emotional or physical kind of courage. It is partly mental, but mostly it is an
act of spiritual will. One takes one's loss and one goes on anew, knowing
full well that some day, in some place, the ghosts dismissed will be met
again. But if, in the meantime, one has grown enough and established
oneself at a higher level of consciousness and power, one will know better
how to deal with the unfinished business.
Astrological textbooks repeat that the twelfth house is the house of
karma and of bondage. But it is also potentially the field of fulfillment and
the symbol of the perfect end which is the prelude for a more glorious
future. What the natal twelfth house indicates is how one can reach perfect
fulfillment, if one can reach it at all. It does not say whether or not one will
reach it. It does not say whether or not one will leave many waste products
and much unfinished business at the close of one's life cycle or of any
smaller cycles. It does not say whether or not one will be able to dismiss
one's ghosts – dismiss them with a blessing and courageously renew one's
mind and one's life. But it tells something concerning the nature and
insistency of the ghosts one has to deal with; and it gives a general picture
of the subconscious – the realm of ghosts and of the remains of problems
unsolved or experiences unlived. It suggests the best way to deal with one's
ghosts and with the disintegrating products of the subconscious. The twelfth house gives as positive indications as any other house.
There are indeed no bad houses. But there are fields of experience in which
crises do occur, and must occur for the sake of a greater future. In the sixth
house, one meets crises that involve preparation for the life of relationships
– the field of the seventh house. One must meet these crises successfully if
one is to experience true partnership and the deep, vibrant sense of sharing
steady companionship. In the twelfth house, crises result from the way one
has worked out one's relationships to the community, or to the culture and
its values. In the twelfth house a man meets the results of his social and
professional failures or frustrations, but also those of his successes and his
gains. Above all, he meets the less obvious results of the methods he has
used in order to reach fame and power, or of the laziness and inertia which
have brought him inner or outer defeat. Many achievements indeed produce
a shadow as dark as the attainments were spectacular. Success often
engenders resentment or enmity, or might inflict misery or even death upon
others. One should be aware of these negative results and also of the fears,
the sense of guilt, the remorse, the nightmares repeating past tragic scenes
one cannot stop – the shadows which our own actions have produced,
directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly.
The only way to deal with a shadow is to illuminate it by use of lights
focused upon it from different directions. One must not become frightened
or frozen up. Ghosts and shadows will vanish when subjected to the light of
understanding and compassion.
Astrological tradition assigns to the fourth house the meaning of “the
end of things,” so the reader may wonder how this fits in with what has
been stated in the foregoing paragraphs about the twelfth house. This
apparent contradiction can be resolved if one realizes that the end of which
the old astrologers spoke was a total end, an end that did not imply a new
beginning. In the twelfth house, the individual faces an end which can and
does become a beginning – a transition between two cycles. He stands on
the threshold between two conditions.
But let us suppose that he stumbles over that threshold and collapses;
that as he meets his ghosts, they overcome him. Then the new cycle is not a
rebirth, but a descent into the abyss of final and total disintegration: He has
missed the crucial moment of transformation, and he descends progressively through the first, second, and third houses to reach bottom,
the ultimate end, in the fourth house.
In everyday life, many things do die without any conceivable return, at
least insofar as our personal consciousness will ever be able to know. In
horary astrology, when a person inquires about a particular concrete matter,
the fourth house of the horary chart refers indeed to the end of the matter.
Yet what seems very dead may leave ghosts; in this case, the remains of the
matter one thought ended will come back to obsess the individual in the
subconscious.
Nothing should be allowed to die a final death; everything should be
transformed and transfigured – transformed in the eleventh house and
transfigured in the twelfth. Every cycle of activity, as it comes to its
eleventh and twelfth house stages, should theoretically become transfigured
into a new beginning of activity at a higher level. Nothing comes to a dead
end unless at some crucial time of crisis and opportunity it has failed to
become transfigured or translated into something new and greater. The
symbolic place where it can become so translated is the twelfth house. It is
only when this translation has failed that the ultimate fourth house end
comes inevitably by progressive stages – in the first, second, and third
houses considered in a purely negative sense as phases of disintegration.
The twelfth house is, therefore, a most profoundly important field of
experience, with a meaning that extends far beyond the superficial one
attributed to it by classical astrology. It is indeed a house of mystery, for all
transitional stages are filled with mysterious and unknowable or irrational
elements. These too must be met, in whatever form they may take. They
should be met armed with a clear understanding of the entire sequence of
past experiences, with courage and with faith, as well as with compassion.
Such meetings are promises of immortality. THE THREE-LEVEL CYCLE OF INDIVIDUAL
EXPERIENCES
In this book I have defined the natal houses as sections of the space
surrounding the new human organism as it takes its first breath, thus
establishing its primary and basic relationship with an open environment,
the universe. As I went on interpreting the meaning of houses as fields of
experiences, however, it should have become clear that what was pictured is
actually a cyclic series of twelve phases in a process of individual
unfolding; and any process, of course, implies the factor of time. Thus there
is some degree of ambiguity in my approach. This ambiguity nevertheless
simply refers to the most basic fact of existence – the fact that it takes time
to become conscious of all the implications of existence in surrounding
space.
We may put it differently by saying that time is the measure of an
individual consciousness' inability, at whatever level this consciousness
operates, to experience at once all that it is possible to experience. An
individual consciousness operates in terms of the capability of a structured
mind and of its instrumentalities – the brain and the whole nervous system –
to perceive, relate, integrate, and interpret stimuli of various types. This
capability is limited; the mind can absorb and process only so much at a
time. It is the limits of this capability which determine the relation of space
to time; the more limited the mental ability, the more time is necessary to
scan and react to the whole of the surrounding space.
All possibilities of experiences open to us as human beings, born at a
particular point in space, are correlated, and they interact. Thus, as I have
said, an individual theoretically can respond to life at any moment in terms
of all the houses. If he rushes out into a fifth house love affair or procreates
a child, the seventh house quality of his relationship to another human
being, his professional achievements, his friendships, and his dreams may
be involved in the background; as, of course, are his self-image – first
house – and his possessions – second house. Nevertheless, his focus of attention will be on the love affair; his ego-consciousness will be centered
in this type of experience. It could not be centered in this manner if he were
only three years old, simply because the glandular and brain functions
required for such a focus of attention and the subsequent arousal of
specialized body energies would not then be sufficiently actualized, even
though they exist in a latent condition.
We are therefore dealing with a gradual process of self-actualization,
that is, with a growing person. This growth takes place, or can take place, at
three specific levels – though here again the distinction between these levels
should not be made too sharply. A “higher” level may be already partially
reflected upon and illumining a lower one.
In my book The Astrology of Personality (first edition, 1936, page 229
and following)13 I described in some detail “the Unfolding of the Individual
Self,” and the reader is referred to what is said there. The matter was also
discussed from a somewhat different point of view in New Mansions for
New Men (1938, Part One: Prelude, pages 3 to 11). What was stated in
these works can be summed up in a few paragraphs as follows:
The experiences of a person having achieved a consistent state of
individualization can take place at three basic levels, and the natural process
of growth in personality – in the broadest sense of the term – is cyclic; as I
already said, each cycle theoretically lasts 28 years. The number 28 can be
shown to be “the measure of Man,” especially of Man in an individually
conscious and self-actualizing condition of existence – man as we ideally
imagine him today, “archetypal” man.
During each 28-year cycle a human being normally focuses his attention
successively upon, and symbolically passes through, each of the twelve
fields of experience represented by his natal house. Step by step he takes as
full cognizance as is possible of the possibilities of experience inherent in
each house-field from the first house to the twelfth. Then the process is
repeated at a “higher” level from age 28 to age 56 and, potentially at least,
at a still more inclusive and spiritual level from 56 to 84. The 84-year cycle
is that of Uranus, and in astrological symbolism the power of selftransformation is characteristic of the Uranus function. A truly
individualized person with a relatively well-developed mind has in him the
possibility to transform his state of awareness so that he can move from one level of consciousness to another, and thus keep repolarizing his inner
being. Man at a more primitive and tribal state of evolution was not able to
individualize or transform his consciousness in this way – though in special
cases another type of process was presumably at work, but the results were
basically different.
One can therefore speak of three “births” which represent a sort of
dialectical sequence – that is, thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.
Astrologically speaking, a man is born in the physical biosphere of this
planet at his first breath – thesis. He is reborn in the psychomental
noosphere at age 28. And, potentially, he can be born again in the spiritual
realm – pneumosphere – at age 56, provided his consciousness has been
truly developed in terms of individual values during his mature period, 28
to 56. If there has been no such development, or this development has
ceased, then the period lasting through the sixties until death can hardly
mark anything but a slow disintegration or atrophy of the personality.
The first birth in matter is also birth in the field of a particular racial,
cultural, and social type of consciousness. There the roots of the personality
are established according to a collective tradition as well as a genetic
pattern. These are the foundations of the temple of the individual,
foundations in the dark, collective unconscious. The young person brings
the past to a state of fulfillment in the present, theoretically as he graduates
from studies which have enabled him to assimilate the past of his culture
and, deeper still, of mankind; but he may also rebel against what he
considers to be obsolete, binding, and perverting.
The second birth is “birth in individuality.” The still young person,
around the age of 28, can realize what or who he is as an individual. He
may realize this in terms of a definite vocation within an accepted social
system to which he may bring new elements, or he may “find himself”
through a long struggle against his tradition. But, before that age, what the
adolescent and/or student may believe to be his own is most likely only a
form of protest motivated by his dissatisfaction with old patterns. Protest
binds as effectively as subservience; one is bound by hate as much as by
love. The true birth-in-individuality comes only when through, yet beyond
the discontent and the protest the maturing person becomes aware of the
tone of his or her true self and destiny. Negative revolt should then give
way to positive self-assertion. The third “birth,” if it occurs at all and not merely takes the form of an
imprecise feeling or yearning for spiritual values, should transcend both the
collective past of the society and the achievements of the individual. But in
this very process of transcending, both the collective and the individual
factors find fulfillment. The individual comes clearly to realize his function
in his community, or in human evolution as a whole; and his society comes
to realize the value of his contribution. Even if his contribution is a
catharsis-inducing and revolutionary one, during this last 28-year period of
the person's life there should be some experience of recognition and
acceptance by at least a “seed group” composed of future-oriented
individuals. The contribution tends then to take the form of “symbols”
which, being transferable to other men, insure at least for a brief period the
relative immortality of the individual who through them actualized the
spiritual harvest of his experiences. Symbols in this case can be specific
deeds which remain in the memory of those who witnessed them, as well as
works of art, books, or teachings.
Astrologically, and in terms of astronomical facts as well, when one
thinks of a process of self-actualizing through twelve basic fields Of
characteristic experiences, one visualizes a cyclic motion of the point
representing the essential individuality of a person, namely, the Ascendant.
It should be clear that actually the horizon – of which the Ascendant is the
eastern end in a two-dimensional birth chart – does move after physical
birth. This motion is due to the rotation of the Earth in a counterclockwise
direction around its axis – that is, from the first house to the second, third,
etc. Yet, as I have already stated, while what is seen in the sky at the
horizon may change, the fact that a person experiences a horizon does not
change. Everywhere the individual carries with him a horizon and a
meridian; they constitute the structuring factors of his individuality and his
consciousness. If he were to float in interstellar space, he would not have an
experience of horizon.
Most astrologers still think of the series of houses as an expression of
the daily rotation of our globe around its axis. From a planetary point of
view this is indeed the case, and when I wrote The Astrology of Personality
I followed mainly this approach, though I already felt dissatisfied with
some of its applications. In subsequent years I came to realize that if one
thought of a birth chart as the chart of an individual and not as that of the whole planet at a particular moment, it was necessary to assign an essential
place to the space factor. In any so-called person-centered approach to
astrology, it must be accepted as a basic fact that man lives at the surface of
the globe, not at its center. What the birth chart represents is the individual's
relation to the universe at the moment of birth; it is his orientation in space.
The individual person is his spatial relationship to the universe and to all
that there is in it at that moment. This is the permanent pattern of his
individual selfhood – or, one might say, the blue- print of the temple of his
selfhood; and blueprints are space factors.
Yet this blueprint constitutes only an archetype, an ideal and potential
structure. The ideal must become the real, the blueprint must become an
actual building, and this implies a process of gradual actualization. This is
what the astrologer means when he speaks of progressions and transits. But
these deal primarily, if not always exclusively, with the movements of the
planets. Astrologers have also used the motion of the natal meridian – thus
the speed of the globe's rotation – as a basis for time measurements and
predictions, for instance in the so-called primary directions.
These, however, refer to the actual motions of the celestial bodies and to
their influence on the Earth; thus to changes in the environment of the
individual. When I refer to the 28-year periods, I mean subjective changes
in a person's conscious self-image – that is, the attitude a person has toward
himself as he meets the challenge of everyday experiences. This self-image
evolves as changes occur in the rhythm and intensity of the body's energies.
To a large extent the change follows the age factor. The self-image normally
has a very different character in a child, a 40-year-old person or a retired
man. These are generic changes, but they are deeply modified by personal
characteristics and events.
These changes can be symbolized to a large extent if one uses the
following approach. Imagine that the Ascendant, or point of Self, moves
around the whole chart counterclockwise every 28 years; every seven years
it touches one of the angles of the natal chart. Thus at the 7th birthday the
natal Nadir point will be reached; at 14, the Descendant; at 21, the Zenith or
Mid-heaven; a new cycle begins at 28, and again at 56.
This is a picture of the well-known 7-year cycle so often mentioned in
esoteric writings, and I have dealt with the meaning of these ages–7, 14, 21,
28, 35, 42, 40, 56, etc. – in The Astrology of Personality and in various articles. This cycle, I repeat, affects every human being more or less deeply,
and brings more or less characteristic and crucial events or changes in
consciousness to him. But the individual character of what occurs in terms
of this cycle can also be suggested – I shall not say ascertained – by the
contacts that the Point of Self makes with the natal planets as it sweeps
around the life-clock which the house-circle represents. These contacts in a
great many instances seem to catalyze changes in the consciousness of the
individual, but often not in an obvious way. These changes may depend
upon or refer to external events, but they need not always do so.
A problem arises concerning the best way to measure the progress of
the Point of Self around the chart. One can divide the number of degrees of
the zodiac between the horizon and the meridian by seven, and thus
calculate how many degrees the Point covers in one year. But as the EastNorth and the North-West quadrants of a birth chart in most cases do not
contain the same numbers of degrees – and the same applies to the WestSouth and the South-East quadrants – this means that the Point of Self
moves at varying speeds. But, according to the concept formulated in this
book, what is essential is the spatial character of the houses – which fits
the Campanus system of house division – and not the time factor, that is,
the time it takes for a zodiacal degree and for the planets to rise from the
horizon to the meridian – Placidus system. Therefore it seems to me logical
to divide the space surrounding the newborn at the surface of the globe into
equal sections. Each house represents 30 degrees of person-centered space
and the Point of Self moves through that space at an even speed from house
cusp to house cusp, at the rate of 28 months per house – that is, 28 years
divided by 12.
This means that in order to ascertain when the Point of Self exactly
crosses a planet, one has to calculate its position in terms of house space.
This is a more complex calculation, but exactness is not too significant in
such a technique, for we are more concerned with subjective changes in
consciousness and psychological attitude than with events located precisely
in time. The Point of Self reaches the second house cusp of a birth chart 28
months – two years and four months – after birth, the third house cusp 56
months – four years and 8 months – after birth, and the fourth house cusp or
Nadir 84 months, that is, 7 years after birth. If a planet is located at the
exact midpoint between the cusp of the third and die fourth houses then the Point of Self will first cross this planet at age 5 years and 10 months, and in
its second circuit 33 years and 10 months after birth. If we divide the
number of zodiacal degrees within a house by 28, the result will determine
in terms of zodiacal degrees the space which the Point of Self travels in one
month while in that house.
For instance, in my own birth chart the Moon is on the 25th degree of
Aquarius in the second house which extends from Aquarius 1° to Pisces 16°
– Campanus house system. The house therefore contains 45 degrees. The
number 45 divided by 28 gives 1.6, a little over one and a half months per
degree of the zodiac. The Moon is 23 degrees ahead of the zodiacal
longitude of the second house cusp, which means that it is just past the midpoint of the second house. The cusp of the second house corresponds to age
30 plus Júpiter months and therefore the Point of Self crossed my natal Moon
when I was 30 years and Júpiter months plus one year and a little over two
months, or at the age of 31 and a half. During that month I experienced one
of the very rare orchestral performances of a symphonic work of mine, The
Surge of Fire, and it was a notable success. The Point of Self touched my
natal Mercury at 41/2 Pisces when I was 33 years and about Mercúrio months, and
at the time my book The Rebirth of Hindu Music was published in India
and a book of poems in Carmel, California. But more important still, during
that period I had begun to lecture a great deal and to define my philosophy
more strictly.
Exactly at the age of 35 – the Point of Self entering the fourth house –
the decision was taken which led, two months later, to my first marriage.
The Point of Self had passed over my natal Sun – third degree of Aries –
when a death and subsequent events set the stage for this marriage. It led
indirectly to devoting most of my attention to astrology, and to a great deal
of writing.
At the time when the Point of Self had passed a triple conjunction of
Pluto, Mars, and Neptune at the end of my sixth house, I had been gravely
ill – age 13 to 14 – and twenty-eight years later a much less serious yet
difficult situation developed involving a kind of psychological crisis.
Significant contacts and changes in my sense of relationship occurred when
the Point of Self crossed Jupiter in my seventh house for the first and
second time. When it crossed it for the third time in 1966 I experienced a
wide spread of public interest in my works and my approach to life. The third crossing of my natal sixth house was manifested as a vast increase in
work, in consequence of which I had to struggle against constant fatigue
and to give medical attention to the aging processes of the body.
Such an example does not mean much in itself. There are cases which
reveal very significant correlations between the planetary contacts of the
moving Point of Self and changes in consciousness; in others these
correlations are not clear. Obviously much depends on how a person
responds to the possibility of inner transformation. One can say
nevertheless that, in general, the contacts between the Point of. Self and the
planets tend to indicate the times in a person's life when the functions
represented by these planets tend to affect in an especially noticeable way
the self-image of the growing person, and they should draw his attention.
Contacts of the Point of Self with the positions of planets “progressed”
according to the secondary progression technique may also be significant.
In some cases they have been found to correspond more closely to the
actual events which catalyzed the change in consciousness. The puzzling
thing is that one often does not find any correspondence for changes or
crises which one considers very basic. It may be that these crises are
actually the inevitable outcome of previous turning points and individual
decisions which at the time did not appear important. Here we face the most
serious of all astrological problems, the determination of when anything
really begins. PART THREE THE FOUR ANGLES & THEIR ZODIACAL POLARITIES
In the proceeding chapters I discussed the meanings of the twelve houses as
related and sequential fields of experiences. The individual must pass
through and absorb the contents of these twelve basic types of experiences
in order to actualize, in concrete terms and under the conditions prevailing
in the Earth environment in which he lives, the potentialities inherent in his
moment of birth. Defining the seventh house as the field referring to
experiences of partnership tells nothing about the character of these
experiences in the life of a particular person, nor does it tell us how he will
tend to approach and respond to his closest associates. The astrologer tries
to understand these factors, and the nature of the individual's actions and
reactions, by considering (1) the zodiacal sign and degree at the cusp of the
house; also the number of degrees in the house and whether or not it
includes an “intercepted sign,” (2) the planetary ruler of the sign on the
cusp, and (3) whether a planet or several planets are located in the natal
house.
Astrological textbooks usually tell, often with a very unfortunate kind of
definiteness, what can be inferred from the presence of every sign of the
zodiac at the cusp of every house. I stress the word “inferred” because this
is merely an inference, a possibility, at best an expectable trend.
“Textbooks” present quite inevitably an analytical picture of what
everything may mean; and often the meanings listed under each heading in
the textbook refer to very different matters which at first glance can hardly
be related to one another. If the descriptions and listing are sound there is
nevertheless a basic relationship between the traits of character or the type
of events listed. Yet a house, for instance, on whose cusp we find the
“expansive” sign, Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter may also contain Saturn, a
planet whose nature is limiting, constrictive, and often frustrating. The basic
problem one has to meet in interpreting an entire birth chart is how to
synthesize these opposite meanings. Another problem is what is best to tell
the person whose chart one is interpreting, considering his age, his or her present circumstances, and the probable ability he or she may have to
respond constructively to what is being said. But these are matters which
cannot be discussed here, and the reader is referred in particular to my
series of booklets on Humanistic astrology.
In these booklets I have explained the difference between a holistic and
a strictly analytical approach to astrology, between “person-centered” and
“event-oriented” types of interpretation. If I mention these matters here it is
because in this chapter and the next I shall attempt to clarify some points
which refer to the usual text-book type of analytical interpretation. To do
this seemed necessary in order to bring a degree of definiteness and
practicality to the general principles formulated in the preceding chapters.
Even if the astrologer has to focus his attention analytically on one
single factor in a chart, there are nevertheless certain basic facts he should
always hold in mind. The most important of these are that everything in a
chart has its polar opposite, and that any factor can have a negative as well
as a positive significance, regardless of whether it is usually classified as
good or bad, fortunate or unfortunate. This principle of polarity is the
cornerstone of any sound astrological interpretation, and it is particularly in
evidence when we deal with axes in a chart. The horizon and meridian are
axes; the Ascendant and Descendant, the Zenith and Nadir are the
theoretical ends of these axes as they cross the ecliptic. Likewise the North
and South Nodes of the Moon, and of all planets, are the two ends of axes.
To define the meaning of one end without including in the definition the
meaning of the other end simply does not make any sense, at least if one
wants to present a complete picture of a situation or a personality. Yet this is
what is commonly done.
What I mean, for instance, is that if one wishes to describe the
characteristic qualities of a Leo Ascendant – that is, how the person's selfimage has a Leo character – one should take into consideration the
inevitable fact that his approach to partnership – Descendant – will have an
Aquarius character; and vice versa. One cannot separate the way one sees
oneself – which means also the best way to experience one's essential
individuality and unique destiny – from the manner in which one meets
people and enters into various types of partnership. These two factors in the
personality – selfhood and relationship – are constantly interacting because
they are two interdependent aspects of one fundamental drive, the drive to full individualized consciousness. You cannot be conscious alone, in a
vacuum; the types of relationship implied in the seventh house must involve
some degree of conscious awareness of the self and of the other person or
persons.
Thus if an astrology text lists the characteristics to be attributed to Aries
at the Ascendant the list should include traits which can also be referred to
Libra as the sign at the Descendant. This is often done, but without making
clear how the characteristics come to be included in the description of the
Ascendant, and this can be confusing. In most cases, however, the
astrologer does not think at all of the Libra Descendant when he is telling a
client about his Aries Ascendant, and in such a case the interpretation must
necessarily remain essentially incomplete. I shall therefore indicate
sketchily how one can approach a bipolar interpretation of the natal horizon
as a whole, which includes both the Ascendant and the Descendant. Such an
interpretation will be in terms of the zodiacal signs found at both the eastern
and the western ends of the horizontal line in our present-day twodimensional charts. Then I shall do the same with the vertical meridian axis,
which links Zenith and Nadir – or, in terms of the zodiac. Mid-heaven and
lmum Coeli.
I shall now simply restate that the horizon refers essentially to
consciousness; the meridian, to power. The Ascendant – eastern section of
the horizon – represents the inherent and intuitive awareness of self, or of
individuality. Here a human being discovers his uniqueness, his spiritual
identity, which also means the keynote of his destiny. Here also a person
realizes his difference from other persons. On the other hand, the
Descendant – western section of the horizon – symbolizes the individual's
special way of approaching the problems and opportunities derived from
interpersonal relationships, and in general from all relationships in which he
is willing to enter on a basis of equality and mutuality. Here the individual's
difference has to become adjusted to other people's differences; this
becomes possible through cooperation and in a spirit of love and sharing –
or, negatively, of enmity and conflict.
The meridian refers to the power that comes from the integration of
many elements within an organized and structured existential whole. In the
fourth house what is involved is the integration of the personality and the
stability of its operations and basic approach to life, whether this approach is determined by family or national traditions, or by the person's own
rhythm of being. The tenth house indicates the most natural and best way in
which the individual can become integrated in a collective organism, that is,
a community, a profession, a national state.
Keeping these principles in mind we can then proceed with a brief
characterization of the different types of natal horizons and meridians14.
The Aries/Libra Coupling
These two signs are equinoctial signs of the zodiac. Throughout the annual
solar cycle two forces interact which I have called the Day-force and the
Night-force, and which correspond to the Chinese polarities Yang and Yin.
At the spring equinox the Day- force and the Night-force are of equal
strength; that is, days and nights are of the same length. But the Day-force
is in ascendancy, filled with dynamic intensity as it overcomes the Nightforce. At the fall equinox the two forces are again equal in strength, but
now the Day-force is waning, retreating, and the Night-force is eagerly
increasing its power and its control of the situation.
Aries represents a straightforward movement of life toward a concrete,
tangible, and personalized state of existence, because it is the nature of the
Day-force to seek manifestation through differentiation and personalization
at any level. Thus, if Aries is the sign rising at the eastern horizon when the
first act of at least relative independence is performed – the first breath –
the child's latent consciousness is stamped with a rather impulsive and
impetuous eagerness to assert his uniqueness of destiny – his dharma – and
to attempt to define more clearly who he is by taking a lead in life
situations.
Aries is a sign closely linked with the spirit of adolescence. At this time
the Day-force is just beginning to display its strength; it is still insecure. But
being insecure, it compensates by appearing aggressive. The person with an
Aries Ascendant may tend to romanticize his selfhood. He may be full of
yearnings and desires for anything that mirrors to himself his essential and
unique self. The objects of his desires and the mirrors of his true self will
tend to have Libra characteristics, for Libra will be the sign at his western horizon, the Descendant, thus the symbol of the way he will – or should –
approach interpersonal relationships.
Libra represents movement toward the development of a social-cultural
consciousness, the eagerness for an “I” to interact with a “Thou,” so that
through this interplay a greater life may be experienced. Because the Aries
Ascendant stimulates the typical adolescent yearning for self-expression
and the assertion of uniqueness, it requires as a balancing force a sense of
social values. One has to have something to assert oneself in or for, but at
the Aries level this should not be too much of a challenge; it is better that it
should take the form of a group, a collective set of values, a noble ideal, or
perhaps faith in something that would allow the Aries drive for selfactualization to take form in the release of impersonal or transcendent
spiritual energies.
When the reverse situation presents itself, that is, when Libra rises and
Aries sets at birth, the individual tends to be a field of operation for
collective urges and group ideals, for it is in terms of group activity, or at
least in terms of a strong and idealized partnership, that the individual will
learn what and who he is. This does not at all mean that the person will be
“balanced” – the Libran symbol of “the Balance” is not really understood
by astrologers15 – but rather that he will be much concerned by his social or
cultural role, by the value of his acts of self-expression. It will not be easy
for him to find himself in aloneness, and he may experience insecurity and
inner confusion until he has found his place in some land of group or
society which he intuitively feels to be where he really belongs.
This person will need an individualistic, self-actualizing, emotional
partner to help him find himself through their relationship. This may mean
at times forcing one's way into a partnership in a rather adolescent manner,
or rushing into a devotional commitment to a person – or a personalized
cause – in relationship to whom the individual with the Libra Ascendant
can display his capacity for group organization and social, cultural, or
religious enjoyment. Any group experience requires the catalytic presence
of an individualized vision or release of energy.
The meaning to be attributed to the presence of Aries and Libra at the
two ends of the chart's vertical line follows the principles stated above,
except that now we are dealing with the capacity for organization and integration at both the private-personal – fourth house – and the publicprofessional – tenth house – levels. We should be thinking therefore of the
best kind of power to be sought and experienced in this process of personal
and social alteration.
Aries at the cusp of the fourth house stresses the need for sharply
focused activity and enthusiasm, or faith, in the search for personal
foundations and inner security. Security is not too likely to be found in
passive subservience to a tradition or family pattern. As an English
philosopher wrote during the early nineteen thirties: “The only security is
no-security”; or, one might say: The best defense is to take the offensive.
The problem is: Where does one want to go?
The zodiacal sign at the Mid-heaven should provide the answer to this
question, and this sign is invariably Libra. Thus the goal should be to
participate in a definite social activity and perhaps in the establishment of
new social values. This sense of participation in a communal enterprise can
be so overwhelming as to imply the sacrifice of the values attached to a
strictly personal life – especially in a case where Sagittarius is at the
Ascendant. Such a total devotion to a social-cultural process, perhaps a
deeply transforming or even revolutionary process, may hide a deep sense
of personal insecurity, which in turn may mean a quasi-adolescent and
unstabilized approach to home situations, perhaps a revolt against the
mother and all binding forms of possessive love. A solution for personal
problems of integration should be sought in those tradition- transcending
values which participation in a large, future-oriented or spiritual- religious
community might – hopefully! – reveal to the soul operating at a critical
state between two psychological and mental stages of human evolution.
There should be some discussion here of an important factor so far
merely hinted at in my analysis of the Aries-Libra coupling – that is, the
position of the planets that rule the zodiacal signs, Aries and Libra, and the
Aspects these planets make to the other planets. It is impossible, however,
within the confines of this book to discuss this factor and all the problems
to which it gives rise. Today the concept of “planetary rulership” is rather
ambiguous. It made very much sense in the old geocentric Ptolemaic
system, as it was formulated in terms of the Sun-Moon polarity and the five
levels of planetary activity, each ruled by a planet. But since planets beyond
Saturn are now being used, the symmetrical picture presented under the old system is destroyed, and rulership should probably be understood in a
different way according to our modem concept of the solar system.
Still, even in this awkward and transitional situation, a study of the
planets which traditionally rule the four angles of the birth chart can be very
significant, especially in terms of the house in which the rulers of the
zodiacal signs at the four angles are located. For instance, if Mars – ruler of
Aries in the old system – is placed in a person's seventh house, the Martian
function he should most effectively use in discovering his identity and his
destiny is definitely involved in marriage or partnership. The key to the
discovery of the self lies in the type of relationships the individual will
assume. If Mars were in the fifth house, the individual would most likely
come to discover who he is in the mirror his creations or his children – or
any dynamic attempts at projecting outward what is active within him –
will present to his intuitive perceptions. In the sixth house, the planet ruling
the Ascendant would suggest that the key to self-discovery lies in devoted
work, service, or discipleship.
The same type of reasoning could be used with regard to the other
angles of the natal chart, and possibly – but far less effectively – it could
apply to the planets ruling the zodiacal signs on the cusps of the succeedent
and cadent houses. A person with the ruler of the sign on the Descendant
located in the second house may see his intimate relationships closely
involved in financial matters and requiring a close management of his
innate resources and abilities; in the eighth house, it might refer to the need
for regeneration through experiences of ego surrender if the marriage is to
actualize its transforming potentialities, or to a careful consideration of the
financial outcome of a partnership if the latter is to prove significant and
valuable.
The possibilities offered by such a technique are numerous; they may be
used particularly in vocational guidance with respect to the tenth house and
the planetary ruler of the sign culminating at the Mid-heaven. If this ruler is
in the fifth house, self-expression is necessary for success in communal
activities, or in one's profession. If Libra were then at the Mid-heaven –
Venus being then the ruler of this tenth house – the possibility of success in
some creative occupation, or of giving birth to a gifted child, would be
evident. But if that planet is in disharmonious and tense relationships to
other planets, the realization of these possibilities would require great effort and determination. An opposition between Venus and Saturn would tend to
delay success, or to require a great depth of inquiry and perhaps a struggle
against set patterns of social operation or conventional friends, who
nevertheless in the end could be won over.
From all of this it should be clear how important it is that the house
pattern of a birth chart be exactly established and that the angles be
calculated for the precise moment of the first breath. It is also clear how
incomplete any system of “equal houses” must be which does not take into
consideration the two axes determined by the time and place of birth – or
any system which fails to consider the houses.
The Taurus/Scorpio Coupling
These two signs represent the reaction which follows actions begun during
the equinoctial periods. They refer to a process of coalescence and
stabilization dominated by a definite organic purpose. In Taurus the process
operates mainly at the biological and instinctual level; in Scorpio what is
implied is identification with forces which aim at the interpenetration of
individual units for the purpose of building a larger social or “occult”
organism – an interpenetration which, in order to be effective, must reach
the very roots of the being (thus the connection of Scorpio with sex). Yet it
is Taurus which symbolizes the operations of the natural and biologically
compulsive sexual function, while in Scorpio sexual activity has a
personalized character. In Scorpio, it meets human needs and answers
individual yearnings. Its compulsions are psychological, rather than
glandular and instinctual; thus it is possessive in a personal sense and
subject to all kinds of perversions, but also to transmutation. In Taurus, on
the other hand, it is simply a procreative instinct aiming at producing a
progeny, or a strictly natural release of biopsychic energies.
With Taurus at the Ascendant a person normally discovers his true
nature through productivity, at one level or another. He or she produces and
tends to cling to the products. There may be a thorough identification with
both the process of production and the person or group whose needs this
process will satisfy. There may be not only a fixity of purpose, but pride in accomplishments, biological or social, and as a result a good deal of selfcenteredness and a somewhat narrow horizon. Still, within the particular
field of production in which it is the dharma of the individual to operate,
great results can be obtained. Spiritually or even psychologically speaking
the problem is not to become too personally attached to the results of one's
activity, and to allow nature or life to act through one's person.
A Taurus Ascendant implies inevitably a Scorpio Descendant. The
individual will have to surrender at least partially his ego attachment to his
own products by relating to persons who have a more social vision or who
need to experience the spontaneous and natural release of organic energies.
Such relationships strengthen the part of his nature that seeks broader
horizons and in many cases a more conscious and controlled approach to
productivity – also a more responsible approach in terms of group purpose.
The individual may seek partners through whom he may become more fully
aware of larger social, moral, or political issues.
In the reverse situation the person with a Scorpio Ascendant will often
seek to fulfill his role in society by drawing power from persons very close
to him. Numerous political leaders have been born with Scorpio as their
rising sign – Disraeli, Gandhi, Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini. These people enjoy
the use of social power and identification with the need of their people to
achieve some sort of organic integration at the national level; but, as they
relate to their partners, they draw vital forces from them and they demand
concrete results along fixed lines of activity.
The fixity of purpose and natural organic productivity of the sign Taurus
when related to the fourth house stresses the importance to the individual of
deep roots in a particular land and tradition, and of a solid home foundation.
But, as in every other case, the character of this foundation depends a great
deal on what zodiacal sign is on the Ascendant, for the Ascendant is at the
source of all that characterizes the essential function of the individual as an
individual, that is, his identity as a unique person. In temperate regions of
the northern hemisphere if Taurus is at the Nadir point of the chart one can
expect Capricorn, Aquarius, or even Sagittarius at the Ascendant. The
“Earth” character of Taurus would be strengthened by a Capricorn
Ascendant, and the Cancer Descendant would add to the concentration on
productivity within the radius of the home or of a well-defined field of
activity. I need hardly repeat here that any astrological indication must be related to many others – indeed to the whole chart – before one can grasp its
meaning in terms of a person's character and destiny. The individual
personality is a chord of dynamic factors, and no one factor can be
understood if taken out of the context of the whole chart – which is why
such analytical characterization as suggested here can be tentative and only
partially valid; they deal only with general principles.
Taurus symbolizes in the cycle of the year the evolutionary ascent of life
toward the Sun, the ascent of the sap which nourishes the plant and
culminates in the blossom. The Scorpio Mid-heaven, which polarizes this
ascent if Taurus is at the cusp of the fourth house, represents the flowering
of the life energy in the at least relatively full-grown organism of
personality – thus the glamour of youthful bodies enamored with one
another and, through sexual embraces, seeking to reach the experience of
power which expresses itself through the union of life polarities. A cycle of
experience later, around age fifty, this fulfillment of vital energies may be
replaced by the exaltation of social-professional achievements. These also
imply a union with a superpersonal reality – a group, a nation, mankind –
which releases social power. This may result in the assumption of political
leadership, especially if the sign Leo is rising – as was the case in
Bismarck's chart, and in that of J. Plutão . Morgan the Elder, the international
banker who had much to do in bringing the United States into World War I.
Here again we see polarity at work in the opposed ends of the natal
meridian. Nadir and Zenith. In the fourth house the product of Taurean
fertility is oneself as a person; in the tenth house, the product of Scorpio's
urge to commune in depth with other persons should result in a significant
and productive “office.” The office-holder and the office depend upon each
other. Results are generated by their interaction.
The Gemini/Sagittarius Coupling
The sign Gemini is characterized by a vivid eagerness to extend the scope
of one's personal experiences through many kinds of human contacts, and
the absorption of a variety of information which is found to be readily
available. Gemini is the most typical symbol of intellectual curiosity and of the mind which neatly and analytically classifies knowledge for practical
and personal use. The opposite sign, Sagittarius, refers to a more abstract
and mature type of knowledge, concerned with the integration of distantly
related factors, with philosophy, religion, and any form which the quest for
basic values and understanding or wisdom may take. Gemini deals with
easily accessible encounters and the concrete mind; Sagittarius with all that
expands the horizon, takes one away from routine existence, and incites one
to dream great dreams. Gemini represents the type of mental faculty which
is concerned with control of the environment for greater personal
convenience and the feeding of the ego; Sagittarius is haunted by ever
larger horizons, by the thirst for great adventures beyond the familiar.
A Gemini Ascendant often indicates an avidity for knowledge and the
deep-rooted expectation that it is through knowledge and a multiplicity of
sensations and contacts that one will discover one's own individual identity.
Indeed, the use of thought processes will be very important, but the danger
is that one may be caught in a web of small concerns, logical statements,
experiments, and lost in a maze of information which, while well ordered,
may be empty of larger meaning and unconcerned with social
consequences. The Sagittarius Descendant suggests that relationships
should be based on a larger scheme of values. Sagittarius provides Gemini
with its abstract frames of reference, its logical concepts, its dissatisfaction
with the near-at-hand and the temporarily fashionable. It makes possible an
expansion of consciousness through relationship. The personally
assimilated information, even the mental awareness of one's essential
nature, should be put to use in terms of human fellowship and a sharing of
values with greater minds.
When Sagittarius is the rising sign, the individual may be fond of
outdoor life and travel – or so says the tradition! – but far more significantly
he is a person who will come to realize what and who he is through
involvement in a great cause, a social or religious belief, a search for truth.
This sought-after Truth may be so capitalized that the individual seeks to
promote or propagandize it with an often fanatic zeal, or at least with great
dedication. He may find his own truth and dharma through teaching others
what has fired his enthusiasm; but he needs the polarizing influence of the
more precise, more empirical and analytical Gemini mind. He should,
theoretically at least, seek partners who will cooperate with him along practical lines, perhaps along several lines of endeavor so that his
generalizations and his expansionism may be fed with a variety of relevant
data and multilevel relationships.
Gemini at the cusp of the fourth house tends to provide changing
situations while the process of personality integration takes place. The tree
of personality may be like a palm tree or a sequoia with a very wide and
extensive network of roots not far below the surface, instead of a deepreaching taproot. Concentration on very basic feelings may be somewhat
difficult. The individual may have antennae feeling for multiple impacts
and stimuli for growth, rather than a solid and secure realization of what he
actually is and stands for as a person. The danger is for a strong and clever
ego to develop as the efficient and perhaps proud organizer of complex life
experiences.
Much depends in such a case on the sign at the Ascendant. In most
instances it will be either Aquarius or Pisces; only in the far north could it
be Capricorn, a steadying influence. An Aquarius Ascendant may stress
idealism and/or social discontent; a Pisces Ascendant would tend to give a
touch of transcendence and perhaps psychic instability to the Gemini
foundation of the personality. And the positions of planets in the fourth
house could considerably modify and polarize the typical Gemini
characteristics, either adding restlessness or stabilizing the intellectual
structures upon which the person depends for inner security.
When the situation is reversed and Sagittarius is at the cusp of the fourth
house, philosophical, religious, or ancestral concepts should be sought as
roots for the stabilization and strengthening of the personality. A personal
ambition to leave a strong imprint upon society may be a significant factor.
The early home may be open to many influences and visitors. The mother
may have intense religious convictions and impress them upon the growing
child and adolescent. There may be early travels in childhood. Later on, in
times of crisis, the individual will tend to renew his inner strength by strong
acts of faith in his destiny, and by seeking philosophical or moral
justification for his feelings and perhaps his social ambition.
With Gemini at the Mid-heaven, intellectual capabilities should be used
to the utmost. The assistance of intellectuals, specialists, researchers will be
important in the pursuit of a social or professional goal. A quick mind can
be most valuable in adjusting to the demands of whatever public situation one has to deal with. This power of social adaptation and the ability to
handle information should balance the determination and perhaps selfrighteousness and proselytism of Sagittarius at the chart's Nadir. Franklin D.
Roosevelt's chart is an example of such a situation, but planets in his tenth
house and a massive group in the sign Taurus were even more important in
determining his personality and destiny.
The Cancer/Capricorn Coupling
These two signs have their origin in the solstices, the moments at which the
two polarities of the solar life power are found in a condition of maximum
disequilibrium. In Cancer the Day-force is at the acme of its power, even
though the Night-force is by no means annihilated, and from then on it will
slowly wax in strength. In Capricorn the Night-force is as dominant as it
ever can be. Thus the characteristic features of one of these two forces are
exaggerated and overemphasized in these zodiacal signs. This emphasis
serves a basic purpose in the over-all pattern of the zodiacal cycle: one of
the two polarities is revealed in all its implications and limitations.
In Cancer the Sun which had been moving northward in declination –
that is, the sunsets had occurred for three months to the north of exact
West–”stands still,” which is what the word solstice etymologically means,
sol being the Latin for Sun. This symbolizes an abrupt reversal of the
process which had been going on for half a year. The Gemini eagerness for
conquering more life space and increasing knowledge through all kinds of
experiments stops. Symbolically speaking, the young man who had been
scattering his energies experimenting with a multitude of things gets a job,
marries and settles down to become the head of a family. In this sense,
Cancer represents the stabilizing power of a home. Life energies are being
focused; and a home can be a narrow and exclusivistic focus of attention,
setting a well-defined stage for the birth and education of the child.
This focusing of energy can operate at several levels. Albert Einstein
had a Cancer Ascendant. His ideas led to the concept of a finite spheroidal
universe and he was concerned with the formulation of one basic principle
encompassing all known manifestations of energy. Because the Cancer type strives for the concrete realization of Unity at the root of all modes of
experience, it may be led to mystical realizations of a sort. The sign Cancer
is often associated with psychic gifts, but the validity of this belief depends
a great deal on what one means by psychic. Clairvoyance is usually a
holistic process in which the essence and meaning of a situation as a whole
is seen by the clairvoyant as a symbol or a scene. Characteristic here is the
whole-making activity. Building a home – and not merely a physical house
– is a whole-making activity. The bipolar couple, man-woman, is ideally a
reconstituted whole, potentially procreative because stabilized as one single
biological and social unit.
Capricorn also refers to the achievement of integration, but while
Cancer refers to the narrow biopsychic unity of a personal situation,
Capricorn deals with the large-scale political or managerial institutions of a
complex national state. Modern nations in most cases are not at first
composed of people of the same race or culture; indeed, the purpose of a
national state – at least spiritually speaking – is to integrate different races
and cultures. The problems which all western nations have faced, and are
still facing, arise from the fact that several distinct ethnic groups are made
to interact and to cooperate in the establishment and above all the
maintenance of a perfect union. France is a typical instance, but so is Great
Britain, and of course in a special sense he United States.
A Cancer Ascendant will tend to make a person concerned with very
definite, perhaps intellectually formulatable or experientially workable
goals. The issues are sharply definable and involve individual personalities.
A Capricorn Ascendant leads one to discover one's own essential identity
and destiny in activities that involve the integration of distant factors or of
basic antagonisms which can be integrated only by means of strictly logical
systems or legal instrumentalities requiring some type of police force to
enforce patterns of order.
What is perhaps even more important is that the Cancer Ascendant
person will trust more in the use of personal power and of the dynamic
power of love, while the Capricorn Ascendant will resort to large
impersonal or superpersonal concepts or techniques of organization. Carl
Jung had a Capricorn Ascendant and his system of depth psychology
stresses the idea that the power of archetypes of the collective unconscious
is ultimately more important than that of strictly personal feelings or intellectual concepts. On the other hand, Adler, another psychologist who
also left the Freudian school, had a Cancer Ascendant, and he emphasized
the importance of purely personal reaction to some kind of handicap and the
will-to-power which compensates for feelings of inferiority by expressing
aggressivity.
The person with Cancer as rising sign will also use this process of
personal compensation but primarily as he establishes associations with
other people. He is afraid to meet them in a person-to-person interaction.
He may hide under broad concepts and Capricornian social generalizations.
He has to build a social persona, to play a role in which he can appear
superior to other people; and clairvoyance may turn out to be quite a
remarkable way of impressing the persons with whom one comes into
relationship with one's superior faculty of perception, while at the same
time one is inwardly painfully aware of one's own individual insecurity.
On the other hand, the person with a Capricorn Ascendant has need of
people with whom he can relate person to person, for without such
concretizing meetings and close interpersonal empathy he might feel
personally over-involved in ambitious schemes and large-scale social
planning, or in mystical and cosmic realizations. Capricorn can refer to
experiences and faculties that many people would call “mystical,” but the
reference is rather to the type of consciousness that is able or desires
intensely to operate in terms of a transcendent type of order, of a cosmic
and – in the real sense of this much abused term – occult use of power. He
may tend to overwhelm other people with such power, seeking potential
subjects in order to fulfill what he considers his destiny. It could be a
catabolic kind of destiny.
A fourth house with Cancer at its cusp indicates a human being in
whom the archetypal characteristics associated with the number Júpiter in
numerical symbolism – perhaps the most universal of all symbolic systems
– are quite strong. This is because Cancer is also the fourth sign of the
zodiac. Indeed, the often stressed identity of meaning attributed by
astrologers to Cancer and the fourth house can only be justified on such a
numerological basis. The number Júpiter is die symbol of concrete embodiment
and of the most basic feelings associated with the operation of life energies
and their psychic overtones – the basic drives studied by psychologists.
This number defines the process of integration as it operates at the biopsychic level within human consciousness. It refers to the type of
intelligence which works as the obedient servant of the life force in order to
provide a secure foundation for the growth of personality – an intelligence
whose operations are controlled by expediency, empiricism, and adaptation
to concrete organic needs. This intelligence is related to the Moon in
astrological symbolism, and the Moon is said to rule the sign Cancer. It
refers to the mother only because it is the mother who cares for the baby
incapable of meeting his own needs – the need for food, clothing, shelter,
cleaning, and also for security and love.
A Cancerian fourth house refers therefore to the particularly strong and
probably lifelong need of the individual to focus much of his attention upon
his ability to adapt to changing conditions in his private life. This stresses
the importance not only of the home life, but of all that refers to the process
of personality integration. However, such a concentration upon the near at
hand, the organic, the feelings, and upon some sort of Mother-image, could
be overwhelming if not integrated with what the Capricorn tenth house
implies: that is, an equally strong concern for establishing oneself securely
in a social position. The latter provides the social power, the money,
necessary to run a secure, satisfying home.
When the situation is reversed, and Capricorn is found at the Nadir
point of the chart, public concerns may well dominate a person's private life
– that is, if no special planetary “influence” is at work in the fourth and the
tenth houses. Professional or social activities, however, will tend to be
determined by expediency. Indeed, the public or professional life should be
managed with a keen sense of adjustment to the rapidly changing moods of
the community. If the individual identifies his own fourth house personality
with a broad, social, or cosmic purpose – Capricorn – he will indeed need
flexibility of response, a sense of timing, and a “psychic” feeling of what is
vital and acceptable to his public in order to succeed. With such a position
one most often finds a Libra Ascend-ant. This of course emphasizes the
concern with social issues and values, and the ability to deal with groups –
and in so dealing to discover one's own identity.
The Leo/Aquarius Coupling The four cardinal signs of the zodiac refer to four most characteristic types
of solar activity insofar as nature in the Earth's biosphere is concerned –
equinoctial and solstitial types. These modes of activity become “fixed” in
Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. They are fixed within four specific
types of human organisms; they are condensed, concentrated, and given
characteristic forms which are filled with specific types of substances – and
we know that substance or matter is simply a condensed state of energy.
When a creative person composes a symphony, or paints, or when a
performing artist incarnates on a theatrical stage the personage of a play, he
projects his personal vision by bringing together the esthetic materials his
culture has made available to him or he has selected from his natural
environment. He “fixes” these material elements in a form which expresses
his personal character, or during some collectivistic periods – the character
of his culture, religion, or communal way of life.
In Taurus the equinoctial impulsiveness of the Day-force becomes
substantiated and incorporated through the use of materials available in the
biosphere. In Leo the personalizing characteristics of the summer solstice
are given an individual form in which a life species and a consciously
developed human person see themselves embodied or reflected. In the
opposite section of the zodiac Aquarius gives form to a stabilized social
whole – an ethnic group or a nation – producing what we call a culture. A
culture is expressed in a wide variety of art forms, social forms, clubs,
salons for the discussion of new or old ideas, etc. A culture can only
develop where the social will has established its domination over the
heterogeneous desires and opinions of the separate members of the
community; where a definite “way of life” has emerged.
The individual with a Leo Ascendant seeks to discover who he is by
creating mirrors upon which he can project and reveal to his consciousness
what his original birth-potential – or Soul potentialities and dharma – is. He
seeks to find his self in his creations, at whatever level these creations find
their embodiment; thus the creation may be a child, a work of art, a specific
kind of social performance, etc. If one understands well this process, two
factors will stand out clearly. First, the Leo rising individual has to impose
his desire for self-projection upon whatever materials are necessary; he has
to see that they are available and responsive to his projected imagination
and will force – in Sanskrit, Kriyashakti and Ichchashakti. When these necessary “materials” are other human beings, the Leo person becomes the
man who has to lead and even to rule over people or social projects. But the
second factor, which should not be forgotten, is that this intense desire for
self-projection is rooted in and conditioned by the fact that the individual is
not sure of what he essentially is. He tends to be socially insecure because
he is uncertain of his dharma. He has to prove himself to himself, to
discover who he is in the mirror of his creations. His grand gestures may
indeed be compensations for this inner lack. At all cost he must find out
how people react to him, and perhaps discover his strength in their
subservience. In order to be able to express his unclearly known self, he has
to be able to handle cultural products and thus Aquarian symbols, words,
concepts. He meets his partners in terms of vast concepts – social, cultural,
occult. These are needed to provide basic forms for his will to expression.
Thus the Leo Ascendant must interact with the Aquarius Descendant.
When the situation is reversed and the sign Aquarius is rising at birth,
the individual tends to identify himself, spontaneously and intuitively, with
his culture and all the enjoyments it provides; or with great dreams of
reform, challenging old structures, pioneering for a New Age. Then,
because these cultural forms can be empty of real vital meaning unless
personalized, the individual will seek partners who will cooperate with him
– either partners in cultural play or in reform and perhaps revolutionary
activities. These partnerships may have a very emotional character, because
the individual will demand wholehearted cooperation and often exclusivity.
When the sign Leo is at the cusp of the fourth house, a person's home
life and the development of his personality may be conditioned by a feeling
of pride and the desire to live in an at least relatively sumptuous residence
which will become a stage set for self-expression, or at least in tune with
the need for the exteriorization of what the person senses to belong to him
by right of destiny. Richard Wagner was an excellent example of such a
situation. The fourth house process for personality integration may take on
dramatic overtones, perhaps verging at times on theatricalism. The person
with Leo at the Nadir of his birth chart may have a somewhat regal but
possessive mother. Wherever he is, he wants to be “lord of the manor” –
and it may have to be a well-fortified manor with ego-walls.
The Aquarius Zenith usually indicates reliance of the creative person
upon professional and social patterns as fields for the projection and stabilization of his personal power. He often seeks some relatively large,
and perhaps idealistic, field for public action; he wants a broad stage on
which to play his role, a role in which he can shine individually. His whole
community should be such a stage, or it might be a professional field which
deals with new inventions or offers the opportunity to become a leader or a
prophet.
When Aquarius is at the cusp of the natal fourth house, the search for
personal integration should be deeply affected by social issues and home
life may be inspired or even invaded by idealistic or revolutionary dreams.
Then the Leo Mid-heaven will manifest itself as the tendency to pour
energies emotionally and dramatically into whatever makes possible the
fulfillment of the Aquarian ideals. In such a situation we often find a
Scorpio or Libra Ascendant, and this stresses even more the feeling of
identification with social or occult groups.
The Virgo/Pisces Coupling
The Virgo type is characterized by his analytical and critical temperament,
and by the urge to reorient or repolarize the essential energies of his
emotional-personal nature. Virgo is a symbol of psychological crisis, and
may also refer to ill health, or to a deep feeling that something is to be done
with regard to health. Virgo follows Leo, as trouble usually follows the too
personal manifestation of our urge to self-expression at any cost. But it can
also mean progression to a higher realm of consciousness and personal
metamorphosis.
The Virgo-rising person will seek to single himself out by his
progressive transformations, his spiritual overcomings, his bodily
rejuvenations. In some cases he may achieve much through a sense of
humility and a will to serve others; in others, there will be much criticism or
insistence upon technical achievements. There may be a deep yearning for
purity and even sanctity, which may lead to self-deception and unsound
devotional attitudes.
The Virgo-Ascendant type of person meets his closest associates in a
Piscean manner; and where he is critical as an individual, he may easily be much too open as a lover or a partner. He is longing for the loss of himself
in a collectivity or a cause, just because he is seeking to achieve his
individual status as one who has experienced a personal metamorphosis. He
has to be devoted to whomever or whatever seems to embody the state of
being which is the goal of this metamorphosis.
Pisces symbolizes a state of social, collective crisis. At the stage of life
represented by this last of the zodiacal signs, man finds himself swept by
social storms against which he is powerless. He is controlled by the fateful
consequences of the “sins” of his fathers, and of his past cycles as an
individual. He has to give up all solid things, all comfort or security, and
lose all reliance upon social, cultural, or religious structures, if he is to be
reborn in Aries as a true individual, a source of new life. In Virgo man has
to give up personal limitations which bind. In Pisces, he must give up his
allegiance to old gods and ancient laws and face the new God whose
countenance is as yet unrevealed.
The Pisces-Ascendant type may be wide open to the collective
unconscious – perhaps a medium, perhaps a true seer. But he may also be a
crusader, a leader of armies or of groups dedicated to a greater future for
their nations or for humanity. This very openness to the unknown will call
for partnerships of a critical Virgo type. The Pisces-rising person will
demand of his loved ones that they should pass through ceaseless
metamorphoses. He may demand rigorous discipline and a spotless conduct
from his associates. Having his vision absorbed by vast changes, he will
often meet daily trivialities with impatience and meticulous care. For
himself he will rely upon intuition, but will seek to find intellect and
accuracy of technique in his partners, or will display such Virgo
characteristics in his dealings with others.
Because Virgo and Pisces are signs of the zodiac which refer to critical
states in the evolution of consciousness and of the ability to use power
constructively, it can be expected that when these signs are found at the
natal meridian the individual will tend to achieve power and to fulfill his
destiny in the midst of personal and social transformation. He may discover
where he belongs in the effort to meet issues in personal or social situations
which challenge his impulse to serve, or to play a role in revolutionary
upheavals. Virgo at the cusp of the fourth house should normally bring a great deal
of self-analysis and self-criticism in the process of personality integration.
The value of ancestral, usually taken-for-granted traditions may be
questioned; there may be much preoccupation with the improvement of the
home situation. The mother's influence could lead to concern about diet and
health; the child may feel confused and upset by a critical mother. If Cancer
is the rising sign, the possibility of a mother complex against which the
adolescent may rebel more or less successfully, may be fairly strong. If
Gemini is rising, a greater stress on intellectual processes and analytical
procedures is likely.
Virgo at the Nadir point implies Pisces at the Zenith. The public and/or
professional life should be concerned with large social issues, especially in
terms of a transformation of the status quo. Albert Einstein – With Cancer
Ascendant – is a good example of this, for his work involved him directly in
changes of awesome magnitude in the conduct of international affairs. He
stressed the use of intuition even in scientific discoveries, and his ancestral
roots had tragic overtones. Pisces at the Mid-heaven often favors a musical
profession, as in the case of Richard Strauss, but a Piscean approach to
one's participation in society may take many forms. Much depends as
always on whether or not planets are located in the tenth house, and what
these planets are. The great humorist Will Rogers had a Piscean Midheaven. Humor, in a sense, is related to situations of crisis, because it
challenges assumed values and appearances, particularly regarding public
figures and institutions. On the other hand. Pope Pius XII, with a Piscean
Mid-heaven and a Sagittarian Ascendant, led a religious organization in a
time of crisis.
If the situation is reversed and Virgo is at the Mid-heaven – and Pisces,
therefore, at the fourth house cusp – one may find a person who identifies
with large social trends at a time when it may be his personal destiny to
focus forces of radical change.
This in turn forces him to take a critical Virgo approach to social
institutions or set professional patterns. We see this strongly emphasized in
the birth chart of the great iconoclast Nietzsche and of Benito Mussolini,
promoter of Fascism and of the managerial state. (Mussolini even used
castor oil as an instrument of political power, his gangs forcing his political
opponents to absorb a vast quantity of it on the night preceding crucial political speeches, and votes–with the expected intestinal results for the
victims!) Lenin was another example, with a Scorpio Ascendant suggesting
passionate identification with collectivizing forces; his Pisces Nadir
befitting a homeland in a crisis of total transformation.
In closing this chapter I should stress again that what has been said
indicates trends that can be deeply modified by the presence of planets in
the angular houses, and by their relationships to other planets. In addition,
the importance of the degrees of the zodiac at the four angles of a chart can
hardly be overestimated. But this refers to another field of study which is
full of ambiguity and of confusing claims, yet most significant. I can only
state here that degree symbols can add a new dimension to the
interpretation of the internal character of the angles and of all planets. They
indicate, at least tentatively, the inner quality of the basic situation and the
activity represented by the angles and the planets located on these degrees;
the whole set of 360 degrees theoretically can be likened to the set of the 64
hexagrams of the I Ching. But in order to do this, the cyclic series of degree
symbols has to prove its validity by its internal consistency and by the
structural interrelationships between the symbols, when they are related in
several ways.
The only set which I feel meets these requirements are the Sabian
Symbols, which were recorded during the nineteen twenties by Marc
Edmund Jones and Elsie Wheeler, and which I reproduced with Marc
Jones's permission in The Astrology of Personality. However, when this
book was written - 1934-36, I had not yet made sufficient use of these
symbols to realize that their formulation, and especially their interpretation,
needed a great deal of revision. Marc Jones tried to do this in a later book,
Sabian Symbols, but I personally am not satisfied with the results. A series
of articles I wrote in American Astrology in 1945-46, The Wheel of
Significance, also leaves much more work to be done. Yet even in the form
in which they are available, these symbols can be a significant tool in the
hands of an intuitive interpreter who does not force a philosophical or social
point of view upon them but allows every detail of the symbolic image or
scene to speak for itself. THE PLANETS IN THE TWELVE HOUSES
The relationship between a planet and a house can be interpreted in two
ways. On the one hand, the planet in a house indicates that the basic type of
experiences to which the house refers can be handled to the best advantage
by the physiological and especially the psychological function symbolized
by the planet. On the other hand, the fact that a planet is located in a
particular house suggests that the character of the experiences represented
by that house will affect the manner in which the planetary function
normally operates. To illustrate this last point we might say that if a man
lives in an arctic region, his liver and his drive toward physical
achievements will operate in a manner which is distinctly different from
that which can be expected in the tropics.
The houses have often been linked with the various types of life
circumstances, and this interpretation is correct up to a point. In a strictly
person-centered and humanistic astrology what is essential is the
individual's experience under these types of circumstances (circum-stances
literally means what surrounds the experiencer); in other words, the
subjective aspect of the houses is emphasized rather than the objective
situation inducing the experience. This seems far more important because
the same external circumstances can produce different experiences in
different individuals, or even at different periods in the life of the same
individual. What matters psychologically and holistically is the attitude of
the individual to what occurs.
A planet in a house indicates what type of functional activity will
naturally condition this attitude. It is “natural” for a cat to want to eat birds,
but the cat may be trained not to chase them. In terms of nature's ecological
balance, however, it is “best” for any living organism to act according to its
instinct, death being merely a phase of the vast rhythmic process of nature.
In the Bhagavad-Gita the divine Manifestation, Krishna, enjoins his pupil,
Arjuna, to follow his dharma, what in man is the conscious equivalent of
compulsive and unconscious instinct in animals and plants. Arjuna, a leader of the Warrior caste, is told to strike his enemies not under the impulse of
personal hatred, but as a consecrated agent of the divine Will, leaving this
Will to account for the results of the struggle.
If therefore Mars is in a person's first house, that person will find it
“natural” to go forth as an individual with Martian impulsiveness; by so
doing he or she will “best” come to the realization of his or her essential
“truth of being” or spiritual identity. On the other hand, the Mars function in
that person will tend to be rather strongly individualized, because its basic
purpose will be to reveal to the individual what he or she really is. The
Mars function will be most effective – it will most truly fulfill its purpose –
when used in terms of first house issues, and not, for instance, in terms of
fifth house love affairs and children, or of second and eighth house
management of personal or conjugal business, etc.
This obviously is not meant to convey the idea that the Mars function
cannot operate in all the life circumstances in which it is needed; but the
typical character of that operation in the above-mentioned case should
carry the stamp of a highly individualized purpose and, in a sense at least, it
should be related constantly to the central problem of self-discovery if it is
to be of maximum value to the person with Mars in the first house.
I believe that it is only as this basic approach to the planets and their
positions in natal houses is clearly understood that the student of astrology
can use this particular astrological tool to full advantage. The difficulty in
giving specific examples is that the house position of a planet is only one of
many factors which constantly interact. It should be clear, however, that a
planet in any house, or in any zodiacal sign, always retains its basic
functional character. The traditional concept that a planet is strong or weak,
exalted or in detriment in certain house and sign positions is open to
question; in any case, strength or weakness does not change the functional
character of the planet. At most it can only indicate whether circumstances
and genetic patterning are more or less favorable for the operation of the
function. A relatively weak function can dominate the consciousness of the
organism and perhaps find substitutes for action when such action is
essential to survival or to the individual's basic purpose; moreover, we
should realize that so-called discordant aspects can also release great
strength. Nevertheless, the position of a planet very close to one of the angles of the chart makes its function a prominent feature in the person's
basic approach to life.
The Sun
In each house the Sun indicates that the kind of experience to which the
house refers will tend to call for a spontaneous and at least relatively
forceful release of vital energy.
In the first house this energy should illumine and sustain the search for
identity and the intuitive perception of who one really is, or of one's selfimage. The person with the Sun about to rise may experience an inner
enthusiasm, a freshness of viewpoint, or simply robust health that will
enable him to radiate what he is in a distinct and compelling manner. It is in
such a search for identity and in all deeds requiring personal self-assertion
and emotional intensity that the Sun function will be called upon to operate
most successfully. The negative aspect of this position may be pride and
“in-solence.”
In the second house the Sun tends to stimulate the production of inner
or outer wealth, that is, the outpouring of collective, ancestral, or social
energies into the personality; the result may be that these collective energies
– which may manifest as money-will overpower the person's individuality,
that they will use him instead of being used by him. Vitality can become
possessiveness, “having” may overcome “being.” On the other hand, the
person may become an eminently successful manager of wealth and fulfill
his individual destiny in this way.
In the third house solar vitality should stress the faculty of adaptation to
the environment, which in its characteristically human sense is intelligence.
Intellectual pursuits will draw an abundant flow of energy. Illuminating
experiences can be reached through the power of the mind – a mind that is
both analytical and clear. The Sun in the third house does not necessarily
make a person an intellectual in the usual sense of the word. It can,
however, make him a powerful force vitalizing all that surrounds him, like
Abdul Baha, the son of the great Persian Prophet, who, during forty years of
confinement in Akka, brought light and love to all his companions. In the fourth house, the Sun stresses the vivifying power of inner
experiences of personal integration, and in many cases suggests a vital
contact with one's ancestry, home, and tradition. The roots of the
personality are strong and experiencing their power may lead naturally and
spontaneously to some kind of illumination. But concern with the home and
the land may demand a great outpouring of energy. Self-reliance and a deep
belief in one's “source” can be characteristic of such a solar position, but it
may also mean that security has to be sought and fought for.
In the fifth house the Sun may, yet need not, reveal artistic creativity
and radiant spontaneity in self-expression. The vital forces tend to express
themselves in adventurous and perhaps speculative actions which are
usually rich in emotional content but often egocentric and may represent
merely a way out of inner pressures which seem intolerable. The love
motive may be dominant – as in the case of the Duke of Windsor. There can
also be a strong urge for the use of power and perhaps leadership,
particularly in situations which call for intense vitality. One could cite the
examples of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lenin.
In the sixth house the Sun may indicate the value in following the path
of service, devotion, and discipleship, for a masterful individual may
illumine that path. Hard work or concentration will draw energy from
sources of strength deep within the individual. Crises and transforming
events will be met with great stamina and faith. It should be evident to the
person that such challenging events have to, and can successfully be met. A
sense of dedication to a highly stimulating task is expected, but the Sun in
the house which also refers to health and illness can signify the need to use
one's will power for self-healing. It does not mean low vitality, but the
focusing of vital energies for the purpose of overcoming some weakness,
karma, or the result of misdeeds.
With the Sun in the seventh house, the vital forces tend to be stimulated
mainly in the play of interpersonal relationships. The individual will
normally reach the clearest realization of his basic life purpose by
associating with others in partnership and in view of establishing a
foundation on which a feeling of joint participation in a social purpose can
be based. The individual may be a light to his partners, or he may discover
his true vocation in dealing with matters of interpersonal relationship – as
the psychologist Carl Jung did. In a negative sense he may be an autocrat who uses his partners to serve his goal of mastery. In any case, interpersonal
relationships will demand and receive much attention; they will draw out
the best in the individual, according to the character of his self and his
destiny.
In the eighth house the Sun may bless the fruits of any relationship and
all that increase and illumine the feeling of close union with and integration
into a group process, a social or occult ritual. It may stimulate the capacity
for business management, or for identification with any power or entity
which seems able to help one pierce through the barrier of the known, the
familiar, and the egocentric. It will spotlight the use one makes of the power
born of relationship, and of what the recent past of one's race or society has
made usable; thus the reference to legacies in this house.
In the ninth house the Sun illumines the understanding but also may
indicate an all-consuming ambition. It vitalizes all attempts at self or group
expansion. The lure of the foreign and the exotic may be great, and so also
that of the mystical. Religions and philosophical pursuits are stressed
because the vital drive is toward discovering the basis on which all social
and cosmic relationships operate; thus the meaning of life and all events.
“Great dreams” should be watched and studied. The danger is to become
overpowered by bigness, or by megalomania, to lose contact with everyday
facts.
As the tenth house is the field of achievement and of public or
professional operations, the Sun in this house can mean outer success,
leadership, social power and prestige. It may refer to having an illustrious
father, or living in an authoritarian society. It can also mean that the basic
energy of one's nature will be called upon more or less constantly to handle
difficult, even negative situations. When a planet is in a house, problems
may also arise with regard to the kind of power the planet represents. With
this solar position, prominence is often gained through self-exertion, but in
other instances there may be a natural, spontaneous, and irrepressible
radiance in the personality which produces the fascinator of men.
The Sun may be found in the eleventh house of the birth chart of men
whose urge for social or cultural reform or revolution is glowing at white
heat, men who can bring new vitality to the social or cultural groups to
which they belong. The energy of these men will be oriented more toward
the future than toward the expected fulfillment of traditional patterns. They may be crusaders for a cause's were George Washington, Sun Yat-sen, or
the writer Upton Sinclair. But they may also be excellent managers of social
wealth and should treasure friendships and develop cultivated tastes.
The Sun in the twelfth house tends to throw light on the “unfinished
business” of the past. The clearing up of karma may become a central life
work, which may mean the cleansing of the subconscious and the
repudiation of the ghosts of the unlived life – whether in terms of the
concept of reincarnation or in relation to the first 28 or 56 years of this
present life. The individual may need great solar energy to perform this task
and his attention will be drawn to it again and again. Personal illumination
may come while in jail or confined by physiological, social, or
psychological crises. Power may come to the individual through
identification with some great image of the collective unconscious, on the
basis of which a new start may be made.
The Moon
THE MOON in a house singles out the field of experience in which the
ability to adjust to the challenges of everyday life is most likely to be
required. The individual will have to feel his way cautiously, ready to make
needed compromises and to take care not to be swayed too much by
personal moods, or by the demands of those who depend upon him or her
for guidance and “mothering.”
In the first house this Moon faculty for adaptation and instinctive
evaluation of opportunities and danger operates within a more or less welldefined individualistic structure. The individual needs this faculty – which
may also manifest itself as reliance upon a Mother figure – in order to
realize his uniqueness and his destiny. Experiences of self-discovery, under
certain Moon aspects, may be fleeting and irrational. In a woman's chart the
experience of mother-hood may be decisive and may structure the whole
life.
With the Moon in the second house an individual has to use all his
resources without rigidity, and remain open to what every day brings. If he
is a public figure, an artist, or writer, public response will condition his financial situation. All money situations tend to be fluid. A person with the
Moon in the second house may be very sensitive to the needs of the times
and the demands of the collective unconscious.
A third house Moon should stimulate intellectual activity and the
ability to find one's way in what may be a disturbed or chaotic environment.
Relationships with siblings, and particularly with a female relative – or with
women in general – may stir up the imagination and may guide the
development of a keen intelligence. Objectivity is needed to complement
feelings and dissipate moods.
In the fourth house the Moon refers largely to the mother's influence
and the feeling one has toward one's home and tradition. The individual
may often withdraw within his psychic foundations, perhaps for fear of
meeting disturbing confrontations. A strong sensitivity to the feelings of
people and to the psychic atmosphere of places in which one lives may be
necessary for survival or peace of mind and soul; it also may cause
problems, because of too subjective an approach to the hard realities of
existence. An example of this is Helen Keller, who, though deaf and blind,
with the help of a remarkable woman became a well-known person and a
symbol of courageous adjustment.
The Moon in the fifth house can stress the poetic imagination, but also
an unsteady emotional life, too open to impulses of passion. Yet the Moon
function is needed there to act as the mother of children, or as the mystic
Muse which inspires the artist or musician. A mother should avoid keeping
her children in psychic bondage, even though they may greatly need her
guidance.
In the sixth house the Moon can bring extreme personal sensitivity to
the need for change and personal reorientation. The individual needs this
Moon function to deal with problems of adjustment to often strenuous
working conditions, or to poor health. In time of trouble he may yearn to be
mothered, but instead he should depend on his own ability to adapt and to
effect constructive compromises, even if this may appear to be mere
expediency.
In the seventh house the Moon should provide the sensitivity needed to
adapt oneself to a partner's idiosyncrasies and demands. Flexibility in
matters of interpersonal relationships, particularly in marriage, is very
important. The relationship itself should be nurtured, and even more care should be given to it than to the other partner. A partner should be selected
who could respond to one's psychic projection, especially if the seventh
house in a man's chart is being considered.
In the eighth house the Moon function can refer to the ability to foresee
evolving trends in the field of business, and the need for taking a sensitive
approach to popular moods. The Moon in this field of experience may be
like a magic mirror reflecting unseen forces at work. But, if in strenuous
aspects to some planets, this Moon can bring confusion, occult glamour,
and a passivity to elemental forces. Guidance and an analytical practical
mind should be most valuable.
The Moon in the ninth house indicates the potential ability to adapt to
unfamiliar and perhaps exotic or transcendent conditions of existence, or to
new concepts and symbols. This is a valuable lunar position for people
engaged in large enterprises or in the search for metaphysical truths or
abstract principles. It tends to enable the consciousness to reflect what the
mind may not be able to analyze rationally. In some cases it can produce
seership or a keen understanding of deep currents in politics, as well as the
ability to formulate relevant plans of operation.
In the tenth house the Moon indicates a capacity for putting into
operation large concepts or social plans when it is practical and above all
expedient to do so. The needs of the moment and the mood of the public in
regard to social or political affairs are cleverly assessed and adequate action
easily follows, unless of course the Moon function is disturbed by other
factors. President Franklin D. Roosevelt is a good example of a tenth house
Moon, but with a strong Mars nearby challenging his public activity.
Gandhi is another example.
In the eleventh house the Moon may either reflect the achievements of
a society and its way of life, bringing the individual charming friends and
relaxed feelings, or it may make this individual keenly aware of social
injustices and failures, and focus a collective feeling of public discontent
and perhaps rebellion. In Joan of Arc's traditional chart the Moon is
conjunct Jupiter in this eleventh house – quite an appropriate situation for
one whose “Voices” led to the resurgence of her invaded country and the
birth of the French nation.
In the twelfth house the Moon can indicate a psychic gift, or the general
ability to reflect in the mind the whole meaning of the transition between an ending cycle and the birth of a new one. All depends on what is done with
this faculty. It can be overwhelming and confusing. It can precipitate karma,
leading to a sort of closing of accounts. One must beware of a passive or
defeatist attitude, and of too great an openness to the collective
unconscious, or to one's personal complexes.
Mercury
MERCURY in a house indicates the field of experience in which the power
to communicate information, to remember the results and causes of past
experiences, and to establish relationships between such experiences can
operate with maximum effectiveness. What is also shown is the type of
circumstances which will require the use of this Mercury power.
When this planet is in the first house, the person will tend to use his
mental faculties to discover the nature of his essential being and destiny. He
will see himself differentiated from other persons by his intellectual
approach to his own problems. Much will depend upon whether the Sun is
above or below the horizon. In the chart of the Hindu mystic Ramakrishna,
Mercury and Jupiter are in the first house, but at his birth the Sun and Moon
were conjunct in the twelfth house, which therefore polarized his vital
devotional energies.
In the second house there may be need to concentrate intellectually
upon financial and managerial problems, or upon ways to make use of the
foods for thought provided by one's culture, and perhaps to improve natural
products or techniques of production or acquisition. Money may be made
by means of intellectual efforts.
In the third house Mercury operates in a field of experience to which he
is particularly well suited. Intellectual faculties, any learning process, and
matters referring to the communication of information should be
emphasized in evaluating and adjusting to one's environment. This is a fine
position for experimentalists in science, like Louis Pasteur and Luther
Burbank.
In the fourth house Mercury should be particularly effective as the
power of intellectual concentration and also of discrimination in terms of what can best be used to provide a solid basis for personal security and
strength of character. In some instances the mind in this house is dominated
by national and religious traditions.
In the fifth house Mercury may bring literary abilities and the capacity
to project one's emotional impulses in forms which can communicate them
to other people. Creative impulse could nevertheless be too formalized and
systematized, losing some of their spontaneity and directness. On the other
hand, the mind may be swayed by emotions and ego drives.
In the sixth house Mercury tends to refer to the intellectual worker; or
at least it shows the importance of using one's mind when at work, or when
serving a cause or a great person to whom one is devoted. As the sixth
house relates to situations of crisis and self-transformation, the mind should
be flexible, critical, discriminating, and able to bring objectivity to the
emotional life – of others as well as of oneself. Examples of Mercury in the
sixth house are Carl Jung, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and V. I. Lenin.
Mercury in the seventh house favors contacts with intellectuals and all
activities that formalize interpersonal relationships – contracts and
intellectual agreements of all types. The mind will grow and mature through
human relationships more than by the study of books. One should be
objective in and try to bring clarity to any relationship.
In the eighth house Mercury is needed to work out the practical details
of contracts at all levels. It should lend objectivity to feelings of sharing and
the search for the beyond. In that house Mercury may be transcendentalized
and given greater depth, as was the case in the life of Ralph Waldo Emerson
and Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science movement.
In the ninth house Mercury is called upon to define as clearly as
possible abstract concepts or religious intuitions, or to plan carefully distant
journeys and large-scale attempts at expansion. It may help to remember
dreams and to relate unfamiliar experiences to one's individuality and
purpose.
In the tenth house Mercury is likely to bring an intellectual basis to
one's vocation. It should define clearly one's conscious participation in the
community or in society as a whole. The mind tends to be drawn to social
or professional problems which are in need of being solved and which the
individual feels he can solve. In the eleventh house Mercury may bring many valuable social contacts
with individuals of intellectual stature. The mind should be used to study
and criticize the past, and to plan for a better future. Friends may expect
mental stimulation from you as well as intellectual advice. One should try
to formulate clearly one's hopes and wishes.
In the twelfth house Mercury points to a life turned inward, a life of
meditation perhaps dedicated to transcendent purposes, or forced to
withdraw perhaps by society or by illness from outer activity. Much
attention should be paid to intuitions, hunches, or inner guidance. The mind
may be focused on dealing with social crises or injustices, or with one's
own personal karma and sub-conscious urges.
Venus
VENUS in a house indicates the field of experience in which the desire for
interpersonal relationships and the sharing of values will tend
spontaneously and most effectively to operate, and also how this type of
experience can release its fullest meaning for the person.
With Venus in the first house, a person will probably seek to discover
his unique character and individual purpose in an open and magnetically
attractive manner, for he will feel that this discovery involves his
relationship to other people. Yet he will tend to relate to himself whatever
he realizes in association with others. He above all wants what love
experiences and cultural values can bring to him. He attracts others, but
often in order to possess or integrate them with himself.
In the second house the possessive character of Venus is likely to be
quite strong. The individual may find in himself the flowering of a
significant trend arising from his cultural or ancestral past, bringing this
past to a consummation. He should extract value and meaning from it; if it
relates to wealth, he should let it operate in a harmonious and meaningful
manner, not making love or meaning subservient to possessions.
With Venus in the third house a person may want to share value and
love with people close to him, relatives and neighbors. Venus in that house
brings a glow to the urge to make the best of one's environment. One should seek to beautify, harmonize, integrate this physical as well as
psychological-social environment, and also to bring warmth to mere
intellectual opportunism.
In the fourth house Venus tends to bring harmony to the home situation
and to interpret one's sense of rootedness in a family, a land, a tradition in
terms of one's responsibility to bring the values they contain to fruition. A
certain degree of introversion may be valuable, for the individual has to
impart meaning to his feelings.
Venus in the fifth house indicates that a person can best evaluate life
and understand the significance of his own character when he goes forth in
creative activity or reaches out to someone who will be a catalyst to the
revelation of the archetypal truth of his being. The individual has to project
himself outward in order to see his image reflected in someone else's eyes
and love. This projection may be frustrated again and again, but the desire
remains. It may mean self-projection in one's child; and if so, what must be
avoided is over-attachment and possessiveness.
In the sixth house Venus casts a glow of hope and faith upon the trials
of periods of transition, because the critical state between two conditions
can more easily be given meaning in terms of the whole process of
existence. Service may be pervaded with love, the routine of work by
mutual understanding between employee and employer. The disciple's
emotional life can be concentrated upon and indeed surrendered to the
Master, but this usually involves a difficult ego-transcending and emotional
repolarization.
The seventh house theoretically is the field of experiences in which
Venus can truly radiate, but Venus may also insist that all intimate
relationship reveal their deepest significance and value. The quality of the
relationship may be more important than the partner as an individual, yet
without relationship life would seem barren. Discordant aspects to Venus
may nevertheless give a negative or even sadistic aspect to the need for
relationship. Adolf Hitler pre- sents an excellent example of a Venus
operating along the path of destruction, for Venus was also the planetary
ruler of his Libra Ascendant. Venus can devour as well as bless with love.
In the eighth house Venus can bring to fruition business deals and all
contractual agreements. The sharing with partners is normally harmonious,
but money may not be the only factor involved. Venus in this house should be used to cement with love the in members of a productive group or a
group of seekers after transcendent realities. It should help to keep the
meaning and value of the group clear and convincing.
To the typical experiences of the ninth house Venus should bring the
sense of individual value which an ambitious person, or a man seeking to
escape into exotic or pseudo-mystical realms of consciousness, can easily
lose. But Venus in that house can add glamour and excitement to any
adventure or long journey. It can give to a creative artist an imagination
inspired by religious, metaphysical, or cosmic vistas.
In the tenth house Venus may be an indication of an artistic vocation or,
more generally, of the capacity to organize and integrate groups of people–
or materials – and give them significant form. This is a good position for a
charming and intelligent woman who wants to have a salon where
important people meet. She can then play a significant role by bringing
together the right people for the right purpose – as she sees it.
Venus in the eleventh house can be a powerful magnet, establishing
fields of attraction in which human beings can enjoy and profit from the
results of their public or professional activities, whether as real friends or as
persons sharing a common ideal within a common culture. The love of
beauty and the arts, or a deep feeling for people crushed by society can be
experienced. Venus in this house is the great humanitarian as well as the
refined man of culture. Collective values are likely to be more meaningful
than personal values.
In the twelfth house Venus may represent either dependence upon
traditional values and profits from state institutions, or the individual's
attempt to fathom the meaning of both his own past and his society's
accomplishments, perhaps mainly in order to have a significant basis for
making a new start. If ill-aspected, Venus in the twelfth house can refer to
emotional complexes which need to be investigated and overcome, perhaps
in a place of retreat or confinement.
Mars MARS in a house reveals the field of experience, and thus the
circumstances, in which physical strength, initiative in the pursuit of what
one desires, and some degree of aggressiveness can most successfully be
applied in terms of a person's individual destiny or dharma.
Mars energy in the first house can best be used to pierce beyond
appearances and to force one's way to the center of one's innermost being.
More generally the search for a self-image may be pursued most effectively
through personalized forms of activity, by involving oneself wholly in what
one attempts to do. A good example is President Theodore Roosevelt whose
“big stick” policy gave strong impulse to American expansionism.
Roosevelt was a weak child, and probably overcompensated by becoming a
symbol of aggressiveness.
Mars in the second house does not mean lack of money, as some
astrologers claim, but rather a constant outflow of money which may leave
nothing in reserve. A person assumes risks in the management of his
resources and may perhaps follow irrational impulses. Everything has to be
used and the Mars function may thus become over-personalized and
involved in material values. A person with Mars in the second house may
be a financial genius, or a mere spendthrift.
Mars in the third house indicates the need for initiative and courage in
matters affecting the environment. Conversely, it may reveal the influence
of an aggressive sibling, relative, or neighbor who challenges a person to
use his or her capacity for intellectual agility and quick action. The mind
should be sharp and analytical, perhaps caustic when its beliefs are
attacked. Dante, Victor Hugo, Pasteur, and Harold Wilson had Mars in the
third house.
In the fourth house Mars may refer to a home life in which the
individual has to meet situations arousing his emotions and causing
irritation; these may challenge him to be positive. The urge to fight against
a perverted tradition may be evident, as in the case of Martin Luther. The
individual may seek to go deeper and deeper in order to discover a solid
foundation for his personal activities, regardless of obstacles or family
pressures.
Mars in the fifth house which refers to emotional outgoing and selfexpression, tends to give unusual force and impetuosity to a person's
desires. It may stress the use of the will and the value of wholehearted self- projection and risk-taking. It should stimulate the power of faith and the
artistic imagination. The purpose to which the will and imagination are
directed depends on the level at which the individual operates. Both Lenin
and Pope Pius XII had such a Mars position.
Mars in the sixth house often indicates a natural drive to overcome
personal handicaps – perhaps physical ones – and the will to transform
oneself through work, retraining, service, and/or discipleship. If there is a
concern with ill health, it is because illness is seen as a challenge to seek
healing or a higher form of well-being. Mary Baker Eddy had her Mars in
this house and founded the Church of Christian Scientists based on faith,
will, and the denial of evil.
A person with Mars in his seventh house may rush eagerly toward any
form of close association. He should display initiative in interpersonal
relationships and seek partners in whom he can arouse devotion to a cause
which his imagination and faith may have envisioned. Difficulties with
partners will be challenges to use his will for power, or survival.
In the eighth house Mars indicates the need to take an aggressive or at
least forceful, attitude in business, and to arouse a group of associates to
action. In this position Mars is the leader of social or occult rituals, often
impulsive and reckless in driving others to a goal.
In the ninth house Mars evokes the need to push forward with
indomitable strength and courage in all great quests, be it the search for
gold, for power, or truth, or for a God experience. This position should
favor prosecutors and lawyers, and politicians during a period of national
expansion; it reveals the inner drive that made Disraeli a symbol of British
expansionism.
Tenth house experiences can be energized by Mars, the power that
drives the individual to public achievements and fame. There may be
antagonisms to overcome, but a good fight is welcome. Success will be
achieved mainly through initiative, courage, and faith. A person's energy
will tend to be mobilized for public purposes. Examples, again, are
President Franidin D. Roosevelt and the composer Richard Wagner.
In the eleventh house Mars should be used as will power in any struggle
for the realization of one's ideals. One may have to be very positive in
friendship, or in the promoting of cultural or spiritual goals. This may mean
trouble and/or intellectual controversies which will become quite animated and emotional. This is a good position for reformers and critics of social
injustice.
A person with Mars in the twelfth house may push to the limit his revolt
against society or against what is found in his unconscious, or in some cases
in the collective unconscious of mankind. Mars power can be used to pierce
through old illusions or “karmic deposits” – witness the case of the great
Indian political leader, yogi, and poet Sri Aurobindo – to redeem and
transfigure the past, or simply to claim one's due from social institutions.
Jupiter and Saturn
JUPITER in a house does not need to indicate “good fortune” in matters
signified by this house. It reveals what is the field of experience in which
the drive toward a greater, more expansive, fuller life can most significantly
be focused. Jupiter essentially symbolizes human fellowship and the
increase in well-being or power which result from togetherness and
cooperation.
SATURN is in most ways the polar opposite of Jupiter, for it represents
the drive to self-limitation in order to ensure greater security and a more
concentrated type of activity; yet because man is basically a social entity,
the Saturn function finds its true field of operation as the result of the
operation of the Jupiter function, that is, in the field of social relationship.
Saturn makes a man secure in the fact that his society accepts him and
guarantees his place in it, his name, his signature.
In the first house, Jupiter indicates that there will be self-discovery
through the use of personal authority and managerial power. The guru
realizes his “divinity” as he expands his consciousness within the circle of
his chelas or devotees; the manager needs social activities which demand to
be managed. Thus there is a basic dependence on the use of traditional
values which are valid for the group.
Saturn, on the other hand, when in this first house, reveals the need to
define for oneself and by oneself what one is. There tends to be an
attachment to form and to whatever brings concreteness to intuitions and
inner promptings. But such an attachment shows that survival or sanity may depend on clear definition and focus. No position of Saturn is “bad”; Saturn
does not bring negative results to the type of experiences that the house
signifies. It simply tells what is best to be done with such experiences, and
where the self-protective, self-focusing power of Saturn will operate most
significantly.
In the second house Jupiter tends to bring to the experience of
ownership a feeling of abundance, perhaps even at times of satiety. The
Jupiter function is called upon to manage physical or psychic wealth in
terms of its accepted social use. The owner should see himself as a trustee
of this wealth for society, because the value of his possessions is social in
nature. The selfish enjoyment of privileges represents the negative aspect of
this Jupiter position.
When Saturn is in the second house this does not imply an absence of
possessions, but a crystallization of the concept and feeling of ownership.
The inertia of past social habits prevails because the individual feels
insecure. His task is to concentrate his sense of ownership where he can feel
secure, which may mean within himself. He should not seek expansion into
ever vaster new fields, but he should attempt to focus traditional values and
energies around his own center. The old miser is the caricature of such a
goal.
In the third house Jupiter should bring expansiveness to the experiences
related to this field. The intelligence should use broad social and moral or
religious ideas in seeking a not only satisfactory but expansive adaptation to
the demands of the environment. A person should meet all opportunities for
experimenting, learning, or communicating information in a spirit of good
fellowship and social participation; the mind should not only collect but
integrate data in large classes, to serve as a basis for abstract generalities
and principles of organization.
On the contrary, Saturn in this house is meant to teach the individual
how to concentrate on essentials and to develop caution, objectivity, and an
economy of means in formulating or communicating knowledge. The
immediate environment in which the individual destiny is to unfold may be
dangerous, or the person over- sensitive to its pressures. The youthful ego
must be insulated or protected to allow wholesome growth.
In the fourth house Jupiter reveals the need to broaden the social basis
of the personality and to socialize the home life. The experiences related to personality growth and the identification of the consciousness with some
kind of tradition or land will acquire their highest significance if met with
optimism and trust in the cooperation of all people involved. Negatively
this may mean pride in one's ancestors or family estate, and the overacquisitiveness of a somewhat inflated ego; or if not pride and bombast,
then a longing to gather people around oneself in a court of admirers.
Saturn in this fourth house tends to restrict home life, to draw a person's
energies back to their central point of origin and to over-structure the
consciousness, forcing upon it a strict moral code or set ego-pattern
generated by insecurity or fear. But this can be valuable if required for
living in terms of a secure and well-ordered sense of values. The individual
should not venture beyond his own depth and should carefully feel the
ground under his feet.
Saturn in the fourth house may indicate a karmic condition at home and
heavy pressure from parents, but Jupiter can bring even more trouble
through an overoptimistic mind and a deep-rooted craving for “big things.”
In the fifth house Jupiter evokes the possibility of a warm and generous
love life involving persons of wealth or of expansive temperament. The
individual should have faith in his eventual success even through hard
times. Education and teaching may be fertile fields of activity for him. He
may feel that he has a social mission to perform, whereas it may be only
that such a belief actually serves to magnify his every attempt at ego
expression. The Jupiter function focused in the fifth house may imply an
urge for personal gratification, and self-indulgence through another person
who is seen as only a means to that end.
Saturn, on the other hand, restrains the urge to self-expression and risktaking in love and speculation or gambling, because there is an innate sense
of danger and an insecurity that manifests itself as shyness and social
withdrawal. Yet Saturn in this place can also give much greater depth to
creative activity, even if it restricts production to a small number of works
or to very select or technical fields. The individual's handicaps, however,
can become the very basis for his success or fame – witness the deaf-blind
Helen Keller.
Jupiter in the sixth house can easily bring to the fore the relationship
between employer and employee or guru and chela. It may produce warmth
of understanding and sympathy without detracting from a sense of responsibility, or from the authority of the one who is discharging this
responsibility. Interest or involvement in labor problems or in all forms of
healing is to be expected. The individual in a state of transformation or
crisis should have hope and faith; and the healer or guide should be totally
dedicated to his work. A sense of self-importance and the exaction of some
form of worship should be avoided, at least in our western society.
Saturn in the sixth house tends to stress feelings of deficiency in health,
strength, or social abilities and thus indicates the need for training or
retraining, self-discipline, and a pure or restricted way of life. It may be
good to train and exercise the will, but this may make the character rigid
and the ego more powerful. Avoid trans-forming discipline into a rigid
dependence upon a fixed routine leaving no alternatives.
Jupiter in the seventh house reveals the value of an expansive approach
to interpersonal relationships and a broad sense of human sympathy. The
experience of partnership should be considered in the light of a socialcultural purpose, that is, as a foundation for a more effective participation in
one's community or in society. If the individual's Ascendant should be
Sagittarius, he will seek to discover his essential nature through
relationship. He may want to relate either to people of many types, or to one
person who can offer a wealth of possible avenues for the intimate sharing
of ideas and energies – example: Carl Jung.
Saturn in that house refers to a restricted but perhaps most significantly
focused feeling for interpersonal relationship. Security in relationship will
require subservience to set patterns and traditional rituals. Some kind of
innate fear or shyness has to be overcome through social mechanisms which
protect the individual – or in some cases through a hard mask of
aggressiveness. There may be a transference of the Father image to the
husband or even to authoritarian social figures whose ambition may exact
rigid obedience but also provide a strong purpose in life.
Jupiter in the eighth house points to the need to manage effectively and
in broad terms the fruits of any partnership a person enters into. Society
may place responsibilities upon him as a trustee of wealth. As leader of a
group he will need understanding, empathy, and a sense of proportion and
fair play. His innate social sense will seek situations in which he can work
with a group and play a controlling part in some ritual activity. Saturn in this house can also bring a person in relation to a group, but
mainly for the purpose of finding greater personal security in sharing his
problems and perhaps his fears with others while pursuing some kind of
social work or performance. He may seek to corner as much groupgenerated power as he can, but he may also refuse to participate in anything
concerning which he feels insecure, or which overwhelms his imagination.
If he does participate, he may feel lonely and overburdened.
The ninth house refers to a field of experience in which Jupiter can
shine in all its glory, either in terms of what feeds a strong social ambition
and will-to-power, or in terms of an eager search for the understanding of
the processes of existence, whether at the social, legal, historical, religious,
or cosmic level. The mind – and also perhaps the ego – reaches toward ever
larger fields to understand things and reduce them to manageable
proportions or formulas. The danger may be fanaticism, or loss of
individuality in too-big projects.
Saturn may accept the idea of expansion, but every step of the process
has to be firmly secured. The abstract idea or mystical experience has to be
concretized and personalized. The “God experience” of the illumined soul
becomes in the hands of his followers an institutionalized set of symbols.
Ambition tends to be limited by the ego to whatever certifies rank and
position along traditional lines.
Jupiter in the tenth house demands that the individual aim for big roles
in which social, political, or religious power is openly demonstrated and
acclaimed. He may be born to such a social position – Queen Victoria – or
may reach power and fame through years of effort – Victor Hugo, George
Gershwin. Even if public recognition is not obtained, the goal of significant
participation in community or universal human issues should be held
vividly in the individual's consciousness as his essential destiny, though
personal obstacles may have to be overcome.
Saturn in this house will also draw the individual's life toward some
kind of social activity, but the results of this activity in many cases will
serve primarily to bring to the ego an enduring sense of security and
perhaps an unchallengeable position of strength. In some cases,
nevertheless, this enthroned Saturn refers to the sharply focused use of
social or political power for purposes which seem, at least at first, to be for
the greatest good of a community or nation in a disturbed and disintegrating state. Hitler is a good example of this position of Saturn, as is perhaps
Napoleon; also the English Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, and the
founder of modern China, Sun Yat-sen. The traditional idea that a tenth
house Saturn means political success ending in defeat certainly need not
apply in all cases. Besides, what is important in humanistic astrology is not
the event but the state of consciousness of the individual. Napoleon,
Disraeli, and Hitler “succeeded” in becoming great symbols in the history
of the western world; they presumably fulfilled their destined roles.
Jupiter in the eleventh house indicates that the individual should direct
his abilities toward the implementation and exteriorization of his ideals and
his vision within society. Henry Ford is a good example of success in this
line, as is the Mormon leader Brigham Young. The ideal, however, may be
to enjoy a good life with friends after retirement, professional achievements
having been thought of mostly in terms of the financial results and comfort
they would bring in old age.
Saturn in this house emphasizes the personal motive, the value of
friends and cultural contacts in providing secure enjoyment. While Jupiter
in the eleventh house may work for important social transformation – Ford
assuredly changed, directly or indirectly, the lives of billions of human
beings – Saturn tends to indicate a conservative and traditional viewpoint
and, as in the case of Queen Victoria, a rigid attitude. Even in meeting
friends a person may feel the need to rely upon formalism and moral
taboos, though the Saturn function may simply be used to give form to
dreams or to symbolize death and depression.
In the twelfth house Jupiter can have many meanings according to what
is or has been the most basic relationship of an individual to his society and
to the culture of his period. It can bring wealth, honor, and comfort at the
end of a cycle of experience that has witnessed a successful rise to a social
position; it can lead compassionate and socially dedicated men and women
to bring companionship and sympathy to people who have been battered by
a ruthless society; it can make of some creative personalities symbols of the
great achievements of a dosing cultural period – as Dante did toward the
end of the Medieval era. The subconscious life of a person may be
reorganized and dreams significantly integrated, or an inward-directed life
of meditation may open the consciousness to spiritual guidance – especially
in times of social crises – and perhaps to the will to sacrifice. Saturn in the twelfth house may lead a person to give a concrete, visual,
or audible form to subconscious images or inner pressures. There may be a
deep sense of psychic insecurity calling for anything that would bring order
and stability to a confused inner life, particularly if the social environment
is chaotic, or has forced on him some form of isolation or exile. The twelfth
house has been called “the house of karma and bondage” It need not be, but
Saturn does stress the value of dealing with the “unfinished business” of the
past. This may be interpreted by some as “past lives,” whatever exactly is
meant by these ambiguous terms.
Uranus
As the planets beyond Saturn's orbit stay for a number of years in one sign
of the zodiac, the positions they occupy in the houses of- a birth chart are
particularly important. However, these are planets representing deep and
radical processes of transformation, and the problem for the interpreter is to
try to ascertain intuitively the way in which a person can respond to such
processes and especially whether he or she is able to respond positively and
constructively.
URANUS in a house indicates the type of experience which will allow
the power of transformation and renewal within the individual's deepest
being to operate most significantly. In some cases the possibilities of radical
transformation are small and the person would not be able to withstand
more radical crises; but a crisis which may seem superficial can at times be
merely the indication of a more far-reaching and total metamorphosis
occurring below the conscious level. The transit of Uranus over a person's
natal Sun is in nearly all instances with which I have ever dealt an
indication of deep-seated change, but it is impossible to blow exactly how
the change will manifest itself. It may be mainly a change of consciousness
and attitude, or it may take the form of an apparently external crisisinducing shock when actually the shock occurs because the individual's
pattern of unfoldment, that is, his destiny, calls for it. The same uncertainty
prevails when one tries to interpret the meaning of Uranus' position in any
house. The following are therefore only very brief indications. In the first house Uranus indicates that the individual will discover his
essential truth or dharma mainly through crises challenging him to state, at
least to himself, where he stands and what his goals are. The person may
move from crisis to crisis, with each one perhaps bringing new illumination.
Thus he or she may be a born reformer or leader in some cause challenging
the status quo (Annie Besant, Mary Baker Eddy, Cromwell).
In the second house sudden events may alter a person's financial status,
or genetic factors may induce physiological disturbances and crises. “The
individual may abandon his family fortune and insist on financial
independence, repudiating his past.
In the third house Uranus may produce a restless mind and an oftenchanging environment which demands a capacity for quick readjustment.
The individual may welcome such changing conditions – example: Mutsu
Hito, the Japanese emperor who presided over his country's change from
feudalism to modern industry.
In the fourth house Uranus points to the possibility of becoming
constructively uprooted, of becoming an agent for basic and thorough
revolutionizing forces. Clinging to static home patterns or to a yearning for
ego stability would be futile. Much depends here on what Saturn and the
Moon indicate in the birth chart, for Uranus is the great foe of Saturnian
security and normal adaptation to a steady environment.
With Uranus in the fifth house a person may develop inventiveness or
originality in creative activity. He should not depend on traditional patterns
or modes of expression but instead develop a new way, successful or not, of
releasing his energies and making an impact upon his society – examples:
Thomas A. Edison, the Irish poet and occultist William Butler Yeats, Swami
Vivekananda, founder of the modem Vedanta movement.
Uranus in the sixth house stresses the need to face crises with faith and
determination. The will to transformation is called upon as the backwash of
past failure or inefficiency is experienced. Illness should be seen as a test of
growth. One should serve the future-in-the-making, not a present rooted in
an obsolescent past. Example: Richard Wagner, apostle of the “Music of the
Future,” whose life was a long series of crises.
With Uranus in the seventh house an individual cannot be content with
any entirely normal type of relationship, including marriage. He may deal
as a psychologist with crises in interpersonal relationships – Carl Jung – or with the breaking down of collective patterns of association – George
Washington, Sun Yat-sen. He should bring a new and free spirit to the
principle of cooperative activity – Henry Ford and his assembly-line system
of production.
Uranus in the eighth house demands a new way of managing business
deals, an unfettered mind in approaching the search for the beyond and in
working through groups. It stresses the need for radical changes in the
operation of social processes – V. I. Lenin, Percy Bysshe Shelley.
In the ninth house Uranus is called upon to revolutionize a person's
mind and his traditional approach to organized religion or law. It may send
the individual upon paths of physical or spiritual discovery. Nothing is too
big or secure to be challenged, and this by often unconventional methods –
Gandhi, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
In the tenth house Uranus indicates a public life which must resolutely,
accept change or else be broken up – Stalin and Mussolini, the guillotined
French queen, Marie-Antoinette. New concepts of social or professional
organization should be implemented, and are needed for success. The tide
of change may indeed be irresistible.
With Uranus in the eleventh house the individual is typically involved
in social, political, or cultural ideals, in reform or revolution. He should
make dynamic, stimulating friends who challenge him to transform his
ideals – Victor Hugo, Disraeli.
In the twelfth house the Uranian drive may best be focused upon one's
own subconscious motives and whatever complex may result from one's
“unlived life.” The stage should be cleared and set for rebirth, even if this
has to be done in isolation or apparent defeat. A new stream of energy may
be allowed to flood the inner life once it is fully opened to the future – Sri
Aurobindo, who also had Mars in this house. The individual becomes an
agent for collective transformation.
Neptune
NEPTUNE in a natal house transforms by dissolving all that remains of the
past, but it holds within this dissolution and depersonalization the subtle outlines of a wider and more inclusive future – perhaps what often is called
a Utopia.
As experiences related to the first house are normally centered upon
what constitutes an individual's uniqueness and difference from other
individuals, Neptune in that house indicates that this is not the way to reach
one's highest truth of being. The attention should rather be directed to the
whole of which he is a part; or his consciousness should give up all feeling
of being focused and, as it were, allow the universe to enter. Thus the sense
of self, at least theoretically, would become universalized. Negatively, this
may lead to mediumship and a blurred self-image, and perhaps to a
dependence upon psychedelic drugs. It may lead to an immense compassion
for the underprivileged and the oppressed – Victor Hugo, author of Les
Miserables – or it may indicate the presence of valuable psychic gifts.
Neptune in the second house tends to dissolve the normal feeling of
possessiveness. One may rely upon society or life in general to supply what
one needs. In other cases, the individual may deliberately make himself a
channel through which collective forces and movements can act without
interference.
With Neptune in the third house a man should allow his concrete mind
and his adjustments to his environment to be illumined or transfigured by
collective or mystical forces. He may become the mouthpiece for
revelations which could challenge the very quality of his environment. For
Carl Jung this meant a continued openness to the collective unconscious
throughout his life.
In the fourth house Neptune challenges a person to give up reliance
upon tradition and family patterns – the Duke of Windsor – perhaps in the
name of a glamorous ideal or personal fascination. But it may also mean
using collective needs to establish a broader foundation of existence, or the
incentive to spread oneself over a large field of experience. Henry Ford did
this, at least symbolically, and his popular car was instrumental in breaking
down the limits of the home scene.
A person with Neptune in the fifth house may be attracted by
glamorous adventures and unsound risks. He may strive to impress his
community by giving it what it craves rather than to exteriorize his own
individual truth of being. Neptune in the fifth house may indicate musical or
theatrical gifts, or a facile approach to love experiences. In the sixth house Neptune helps to dissolve ego pride and to make one
experience, through personal crises, a deep sense of catharsis. One should
seek to serve humanitarian causes, to develop compassion, to heal or allow
healing forces to make one whole. In Gandhi's chart it indicated the
technique of nonviolence and the use of “Truth-force” – Satyagraha.
A person with Neptune in the seventh house may find it difficult to
focus his attention upon one single partnership. He may want to neither
possess nor be possessed by another. New ideals of interpersonal
relationship should illumine the consciousness. Here humanitarianism is
extolled and the search for a transcendent union can be all-absorbing –
Richard Wagner.
In the eighth house Neptune can be used to universalize involvement in
group rituals and mass productivity. It tends to fuse the consciousness of the
participants in a mystical experience of superpersonal oneness. At the level
of business it stresses the value of propaganda, and of “hidden persuaders.”
It may lead to illusory states of paradise.
In the ninth house Neptune is the lure of mysticism or psychedelic
experiences and the urge to reach the “unitive state” of cosmic or
theocentric consciousness. For a more down-to-earth individual, it may lead
to a healing profession, especially spiritual healing. It may drive a few
persons to the sea and its vast horizons.
In the tenth house we see Neptune pervading the public life with a
social consciousness that reaches for distant boundaries and seeks an ideal
community. On the way, the individual may accept socialism as a means to
an end. The glamour of the life of society may also be attractive.
With Neptune in the eleventh house a person tends to have broad and
humanitarian ideals, and to dream of beautiful Utopias. Experiences related
to music and the arts which present more or less abstract and transcendent
ideals should be most valuable. One may be attracted to idealistic or highly
social friends.
Neptune in the twelfth house may present the individual with the
faculty of dissolving the ghosts and memories of the past, or it may give
psychic gifts and the ability to tap vast but perhaps imprecise stores of
knowledge. Subconscious images and prenatal drives may intrude upon the
consciousness. Compassion for the afflicted and those who our society
allows to drop out and languish may bring ennobling experiences. Pluto
PLUTO can remain in a zodiacal sign for many years and as a result it
primarily represents the style of life of a period, or of a generation. In the
birth chart of an individual the position of Pluto in a house tends to indicate
in what field of experience the person will make his or her greatest
contribution to his society, and ultimately to mankind. Nothing much more
can be said of its house position because people may not react to what this
symbol of the twentieth-century type of human being signifies. When
effective, it usually implies experiences of a deep-reaching and irreducible
or irrepressible type. It tends to finalize the process of transformation which
Uranus began, but in so doing it opens the door to a new phase of the
evolution of consciousness. What comes through that door may be blinding
and awesome to the normal consciousness of ego-centered man.
Briefly stated, a person with Pluto in his first house will contribute most
to his society by emphasizing the uniqueness of his individuality. He may
focus collective or spiritual forces, and he should try to do this thoroughly,
uncompromisingly. With Pluto in the second house a person should
contribute the possessions and abilities latent in his total physical-psychic
being. These abilities, inherited from the ancestral past, through him may be
given a new value for mankind. With Pluto in the third house a person's
capacity to deal significantly with his environment – his intelligence and
ability to communicate information – may be the greatest thing he can pass
on to those who know him.
With Pluto in the fourth house a person's most valuable contribution to
society should be the capacity, which may be demonstrated by his personal
life, to integrate diverse energies and drives in a wholesome and powerful
personality. Integration here implies either exemplifying in a new statement
of being the traditional roots of a solid cultural attitude, or discovering and
drawing inner strength and security from a strictly individual center. With
Pluto in the fifth house a person could have a creative destiny to fulfill, if
he lets no lesser goal distract his attention and lead him into emotional
bypaths. His creations would then be his most significant contribution. With
Pluto in the sixth house the capacity to work steadily and undistractedly, and the will to serve in utter dedication, would be his greatest contribution,
even if the work itself may be unimportant in an absolute sense.
If Pluto is in the seventh house the ability a person has to relate closely
to his partners – but in terms of principles and social purposes rather than
on an emotional-personal basis – can be his greatest contribution. He may
set a new tone to human contacts and thus to social processes. In the eighth
house Pluto may deal with one kind of ritual or another. To prove that in
their togetherness human beings can produce new values and release
transcendent energies can be the greatest contribution a person born with
such a Pluto position can make. With Pluto in the ninth house a person can
contribute most valuably the experiences and intellectual or spiritual
realizations he has reached in his search for ultimate values and meanings.
With Pluto in the tenth house a person's characteristic participation in
the affairs of his community and in the “work of the world” should be his
most meaningful contribution, for it is his way of integrating the two
polarities of existence, the individual and the collective. Pluto in the
eleventh house tends to give a definite and perhaps fateful character to a
man's ideals and to his vision of better things to come for himself and his
companions. If he can exemplify an unswerving and total concern for and
concentration upon these ideals, that very fact can be a major contribution
to the nobility of man. In the twelfth house Pluto places his stamp upon the
terminal features of a cycle of experience. To accept this “judgment” and
face its consequences courageously and undeviatingly is a most significant
and creative contribution to the typical human capacity to learn from defeat,
as well as from fulfillment, and on that basis to move forward from cycle to
cycle16. EPILOGUE
As a conclusion to this study of the twelve astrological houses I would like
to restate a point that at this time I consider very basic, not only in reference
to astrological practice, but for nearly every field of human endeavor.
I have stressed elsewhere the difference between an “atomistic” and a
“holistic” approach to astrology, and I have shown that the conflict between
them, and the possibility of integrating these two approaches, is of crucial
importance not only in modern science, but in all disciplines of thought.17
The issue that cannot be dismissed is whether man's consciousness
interprets his experiences most significantly in relation to a whole, on the
parts of which these experiences throw some significant light, or as separate
facts about which only close analysis can give us valid knowledge. Today,
of course, it is the kind of knowledge that provides us with power over
definite things that we consider valid.
Astrologically speaking, can we really understand a birth chart and the
total person it is said in some manner to represent if we assign definite
meanings to each planet – or each zodiacal sign, each house, each aspect –
considered as a separate factor? Should we first analyze, and then try to
piece together the data, contradictory as it might be, or should we approach
the chart first as a whole having a definite “form” and consider it a complex
“word” that can reveal “meaning” to us? A careful study of the whole – the
“letters” comprising the word – would still be necessary in order for us to
grasp the details of the whole picture. This analytical study could alter
considerably as well as give precision to our first “holistic” perception of
the chart, but what we would learn analytically would still fit into the
picture of the whole. The overall form of the chart would remain what it is.
Another way of stating these two possibilities is to say that one can look
at anything we experience – whether if be a life situation or an astrological
chart – either in terms of it being a sharply definable and persistent – that is,
relatively permanent – entity, or in terms of its representing one phase of a
process. If we take the first approach we tend to personalize whatever appears to
be the cause of our present experience. This is the attitude of what we call
primitive man. Everything he sees or feels is considered a “spirit.” The
cloud, the lightning, the season of the year, dawn, a disease, etc., are given
names and considered separate entities or gods to whom one may pray or
who can be propitiated or controlled by adequate ceremonies and specific
acts. Mankind is still operating very much at this level, even in our
supposedly highly advanced society. We give to the person we meet a name,
and perhaps an immortal soul. Even though he may alter his appearance,
from that of a child to an old man, we still speak of him as the same
individual. We speak of anger as if it were an entity absolutely distinct from
compassion. We refer to the disease named arthritis, and the doctor
prescribes remedies which apply only to the removal of the symptoms of
the disease. We speak of atoms as separate entities having a permanent
character, which can be altered by other specific entities acting upon them.
We think of God, in most cases, as a Supreme Entity or an absolute Person.
There are exceptions to this, of course, and today these are fast
multiplying. The scientist now presents us with a picture of the universe in
which everything not only changes but cannot be defined too closely. The
atom has become a field of energies and, to many psychologists, the
individual is no longer an irreducible unity but a complex of ever-changing
biopsychic factors. Moreover, the individual and the environment are seen
in a state of constant transforming interaction. This does not mean, from
this point of view, that we cannot speak of atoms, of persons or of special
diseases and particular seasons, electric storms or clouds. What it does
mean is that all these entities can and should be seen as temporary and
sequential manifestations of processes which, in the broadest sense of the
term, are cyclic and include many different phases.
A process, when seen as a whole, can be called an entity; but it is an
entity in the sense that it has a time structure, a beginning and an end. If I
see a caterpillar I know that it will become a a chrysalis and a butterfly or
moth. The form of the caterpillar represents only one phase of a process
which includes the other forms. Besides, if I want to understand this life
process of which this caterpillar is a phase, I have to consider its relation to
the plants in the environment, to the seasons, the conditions of the air
around it, etc. The change from the concept of “permanent entity” to that of process
was most likely sparked by the teachings of Guatama, the Buddha, over
twenty-five centuries ago. The Buddha in particular sought to dis-entitize
man's approach to the human person; he did this by denying that one could
speak of a human being as a permanent and reincarnating entity retaining an
absolute character. A person was, in his eyes, the integration of many
constantly changing factors and the result of causes and effects within a
most extensive process – a “wheel of existence” – having a cyclic pattern.
The process was real; the person experienced at any one time was to be
regarded as only a phase within a process, which nevertheless did not make
it less “real” for whoever also was involved in the process. In atomic
physics it is said that the electron in certain conditions can be considered a
particle, in others a wave – a “wave of possibilities.” This has seemed a
most ambiguous and unsatisfactory concept to many people, yet it is one
which can and should be applied to astrology as well and to the study of the
houses of a birth chart – as I have already pointed out.
A house – as I defined it – is a 30-degree section of the space
surrounding the newborn, but not of the zodiac. It is thus one of twelve
parts of the universe – that is, of the total possibility of experience
available to him. One can divide this total possibility into twelve basic
categories and, as the newborn is at the center of space, the twelve
categories are there around him. But they are there in space and only as
potentialities. The newborn himself is also there in space as a total
organism, but this organism has to develop in time in order to unfold all its
potentialities. As it does so, the twelve basic categories of human
experience will be opened one by one to the growing consciousness.
In this sense therefore “space” refers only to what one might call
archetypal potentialities of existence. In fact, this is always what space
means, for by extending himself in space and – if he is able to do so –
moving through space, a human being has the possibility of new
experiences. Space “is there” now, but the experiences it offers to us are
only potential. Time is needed for us to reach them, as we move through
space, either by our own efforts or as the Earth brings us at every moment
to a new region of galactic space. This earth movement may well be the
basic fact of all evolution, just as the seasons are the basic fact in the yearly
growth of plants, and the day-and-night alternation of waking consciousness and sleep conditions – probably much more than we think –
the development of man's personality.
To return to the astrological houses: they exist in space as twelve
archetypal categories of individual experience, yet these experiences require
the passage of time to become fully actualized. Likewise the classical
concepts of “planetary ages” and “planetary hours” also refer to the
actualization of potentialities. All the planets “are there” always, but at
certain ages and at certain times of the day we can experience more focally
the functional types of activities to which they refer in astrological
symbolism. We can think of the planets as entities sending us “rays” that
somehow affect us on Earth, but we can also think of them as focalizing
phases of a process that establishes the cyclic relationship of a person to the
entire solar system through the days and years of his existence and an
organic whole.
This implies a holistic approach to experience and indeed to the fact of
actual existence. No doubt we can also picture and interpret the universe
and ourselves in terms of “being,” but this inevitably means in terms of
potentiality of experience. If we are dealing with actual experiences and the
problems that result from man's personal development in an actual and
specific environment – and this is what psychologists and psychotherapists
have to deal with – then we have to translate the archetypal categories of
“being” into the facts of “existing.” We have to deal with circumstances and
experiences – or the refusal to experience! – one after the other, as
sequential phases of a process. To this process we can attribute meaning and
the purpose of each experience.
It is this psychological or psychotherapeutic approach that I have taken
in all my astrological and philosophical works. In this sense I could be
called an “existentialist,” but unfortunately this term has acquired a very
special meaning of late and it refers to a very special attitude to life with
which I entirely disagree, and which I consider very illogical as well as
depressing. Let me state again that to speak of “process” does not imply
that there is no “archetypal potentiality of being.” We have to think of space
as well as of time. At the birth of any organism space is, yet the particular
space which surrounds this new birth has significance for the new-born only
in terms of the time this organism will have in which to actualize the
potentialities of experience and consciousness implied in the space factor. And with time we also have to consider the organism's speed of reaction,
which presumably refers to the speed of transmission of sense data – that is,
of “information” – along the nerves of the body.
Thus every living organism – or rather every existential whole, for this
should include as well atoms and galaxies – has its own space and time, or
at least the space and time of the species of life or the cosmic level of
experience to which it belongs. It has been surmised that the speed of light
may constitute the characteristic “speed of reaction” of the cosmos – a
speed enormously faster than that involved in conveying information from
any part of the human body to the brain and back to the organs of action,
simply because the life-span of a man is enormously shorter than that of the
galaxy.
At birth space is; and therefore it is perfectly valid to discuss the
meaning of the signs of the zodiac and of the houses – the two basic
frameworks in astrology – in terms of geometrical relationships and of
polygons inscribed within a circle, as has been fully explained or
emphasized, and because today, at a crucial moment in human history
which imposes crisis-producing experiences upon the development of
individuals, the most important issue is how to deal constructively with
these experiences. And I feel they can best be dealt with, given meaning,
purpose, and utilized when they are approached as passing phases of the
vast process of human existence. Created with Writer2ePub
by Luca Calcinai 1) Lunar zodiacs seem to have been divided into 27 or 28
sections, evidently because the Moon takes 27+ days to
circle the celestial sphere of the “fixed stars.” The day is the
basic measure of time because it refers to the alternation of
light and darkness, of waking consciousness and sleep – the
most fundamental fact in human experience. Lunar zodiacs
refer to a type of human consciousness in which all that the
Moon symbolizes is basic – a consciousness which found
expression in matriarchy and which is dependent on
biological-psychic factors and feeling responses. The solar
zodiac presumably came into prominence as patriarchal
types of organization won over matriarchal systems. In
ancient India there were long wars between solar and lunar
dynasties. The development of theism at the time of the
Bhagavad-Gita in India, then with Akhnaton in Egypt, and
finally with Moses was undoubtedly linked with the
ascendancy of a “solar” type of consciousness, and later
with the growth of individualism. ↵ 2) For a discussion of the two zodiacs, the precessional ages,
