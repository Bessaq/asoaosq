AUGUSTA FOSS HEINDEL A TREATISE ON MEDICAL ASTROLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS
FROM THE HOROSCOPE AND HAND ROSICRUCIAN SYMBOLISM
“Divine symbols which have been given to mankind from time to
time speak to that forum of truth which is within our hearts, and waken
our consciousness to divine ideas entirely beyond words.”—Max Heindel.
The Emblem of the Western Mystery School of the Rosicrucians is one
such symbol: in its entirety it represents God in manifestation. It expresses
the key to man’s past evolution, his present constitution, his future
development, and the method of attainment.
The blue background represents God the Father; the golden star
symbolizes Christ born within the spiritual aspirant and radiating from the
five points—the head and four limbs; the red roses indicate the
purification of the human desire nature on the cross of matter—the blood
of the aspirant cleansed from passion. The white rose symbolizes purity of
heart and also the larynx with which, once purified, humanity will speak
the Creative Word. The white cross represents the physical body. The
golden star represents the “Golden Wedding Garment”—the etheric
vehicle which the Spirit builds during lifetimes of purity and service.
Another reading shows that the cross also indicates plant, animal and
human life-waves. The lower limb is the plant nourished through the roots
with spiritual currents from the Earth; man, the upper limb, receives
spiritual influences from the Sun through the head; animals are sustained
by spiritual currents horizontally surrounding the Earth.
The lamp of wisdom and the heart show the two streams of evolving
humanity: those following the path of intellect (occult) and those
following the path of love (mystic). There can be no contradiction in
Nature, therefore the heart and the mind must be capable of uniting.
Eventual union of head and heart will signify the Perfected Man.
At the foot of the page is the fleur-de-lis, the emblem of the
Trinity—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—but as only the Father and Holy
Spirit were active at the time here represented, we find but two of the
petals colored with red, thus showing energy.
The beings created we see as a stream flowing upwards, provided
with two bodies, the dense and the vital, but after a time the desire body is
added and is shown by the red appearing in the ascending stream.
Although each stream looks alike outwardly, they are vastly
different. The one on the left is known in our literature as the Sons of Cain. They are full of positive energy and are the craftsmen of the world,
the phree-messen, who carve their way through life, rather enjoying the
obstacles which they know strengthen the character; they work through
the intellect, as is shown by the lamp from the flame of which proceed
nine rays, showing the positive path chosen by the esoteric student.
The other stream develops the heart side of life, and the divine flame
proceeding from it shows but eight rays, a negative path; those following
it desiring that they should have a leader; someone to follow, someone to
worship; they are the churchmen of the world who obey the teachings of
their leaders.
Each stream of life flows onward side by side till a time comes when
the wise and loving ones guiding the evolution decide that to hasten
progress it is necessary that the two unite, and plan that this shall be
accomplished by the building of a temple for the worshippers by the
craftsmen and that both streams would unite in a Mystical Molten Sea.
We can see the wonderful impulse by the chalice raised from each and
filled with the red wine of life. You will read the story of this in the
building of Solomon’s Temple. This plan was frustrated by the treachery
of the Sons of Seth—those on the right. And after this each swung further
away from the other than before.
A serious condition now is shown in which some appear to fall away
entirely through materialism. But still the race lives on, the churchman
and the scientist, the mystic and the occultist, each pursuing their own
path independent of the other, till a stage of such materialism is reached
that the spiritual guiders see grave dangers ahead. To prevent the plan of
evolution being defeated, a great destruction of the human bodies is
permitted which for a time looks as if it would wipe humanity off the
earth. See the break in each stream. But this calamity has the desired
effect: we now see again great force and each stream turned directly
toward the other, where they may shortly unite as one. At the foot of the
page we find another symbol, so small that you may have overlooked it.
Here is a small black cross that represents the physical body. In the
enlarged head of the cross is seen the heart. Heart and head have united
and the result is shown in the spreading ray—the resultant soul body. Foreword O F THE thirty years devoted by the undersigned to
research and the study of astrology and astrodiagnosis, a large part was spent with Max Heindel, first as costudent and companion and later as his wife. A portion of the
astro-diagnosis in this book has been taken from Mr. Heindel's
former monthly lessons to esoteric students, and this fact,
together with our association in astrological research, is the
reason why this volume goes out under both our names, even
though he passed into the larger life in 1919.
This book may differ in a few instances from other books
which deal with the science of diagnosis from the planets. The
authors of this volume, however, have had opportunities such
as few other writers on this subject have had. The Rosicrucian
Fellowship, of which they were the founders, has a very
successful healing department. A description of the method
used in this department may be found on page 440. Of the
thousands of patients who have written to us for healing since
the department started, each one has sent in data describing the
disease from which he suffered, its symptoms and peculiarities,
the doctor's diagnosis, etc. This information was in every case
carefully compared with the patient's horoscope, and a detailed
study made of both. The most striking as well as typical cases
were used as monthly lessons for the esoteric students of the
Fellowship. From these lessons we have chosen the best to
print in this book. At no time have we diagnosed direct to the
patient. His horoscope, however, has given us a wonderful key
to the disease from which he was suffering and its causes, and
it has been used as a guide in giving advice regarding diet,
exercise, environment, and similar matters.
3 We do not claim that this book is the last word on the
subject; neither do we claim that it is infallible. The knowledge
which we have gained by years of unceasing labor we are
sharing with the world. We give it freely, and if others can add
to it, we shall rejoice.
—August Foss Heindel Introduction
ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS is the science and art of
obtaining scientific knowledge regarding disease and its
causes as shown by the planets, as well as the means of
overcoming it. This new science of diagnosis and healing
is slowly permeating the medical world. It is a science
which will not set aside the old school of medicine and
diagnosis, but it is an addition to the old school. The
latter, we feel, will in time accept this newer method. At
present many physicians are willing to cooperate with
the newer schools of osteopathy, nature-cure,
chiropractic, etc., and these open-minded men are ready
to accept a more advanced method of diagnosis when it
has been demonstrated to them as reliable.
Depending entirely upon outward symptoms in
locating disease and relying wholly upon the action of
medicine have cost millions of lives in the ages past. But
man is now becoming too enlightened, too broadminded
to stick stubbornly to old methods which have been
proved by many mistakes, by the sacrifice of many lives,
to be inadequate. Medical science with its improved
instruments, the X-ray, iri-diagnosis, blood tests, etc.,
has made great strides toward better methods of
diagnosis. But the time is not far hence when it will be
generally conceded that to know in advance where 5 human chain is weakest, to understand by the science of
the stars where the practitioner may look for trouble, is
by far the best way. Doctors will then arrive very quickly
at the cause of disease, and they will also know what
methods will be best to effect a cure. When they can use
the key to the soul, the horoscope, they will find the
treatment to which the patient will respond. They will
also know the character of the patient, whether his will is
weak, and whether he is negative or emotional. They will
then be guided in their methods of treatment according to
the information thus obtained.
Disease may be classed under two heads, latent and
active. “Symptoms” give indication of disease which is
in process of materializing. Latent tendencies to disease
are shown by the planetary afflictions in the horoscope
of birth. In some instances these tendencies may remain
latent during the entire life because the native has lived
in such a manner that no strain was put on the body
which would give the planets a chance to develop their
latent weakness. If there is a weak link in a chain but no
strain is put upon it, the chain will remain whole. So in
the case of planetary afflictions, they too may remain
latent. But let the native abuse his body and at once these
weak spots will appear. This gives us the second class of
disease, the active type. When the planetary aspects have
been stirred into action and disease has appeared, the
progressed planetary positions give the diagnostician the
key to it. When the medical men, the scientists, the occult
scientists, and the astrologers have reached a friendly
understanding, when the budding discoveries and the
broader thoughts of man are no longer at variance with
each other, then humanity will know that the terrors and
the pain of the operating room are things of the past.
Then buoyant health will be universally enjoyed, for
mankind will be taught how to live in order to avoid
suffering. The doctors will be just as anxious to keep
people well as they now are to help them to recover from
disease. The time is not far hence, we believe, when the
government will feel the necessity of paying doctors a
yearly salary to teach the people how to avoid the pitfalls
which lead to disease. TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ANATOMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL
PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS
ARIES W HEN Aries, which has rule over the head, is
on the Ascendant, we have a person whose
actions are impulsive and aggressive. He acts and speaks
quickly. An excess of life force is generated by these
people. This is intensified when the dynamic Mars,
which is the ruler of Aries, is also in Aries on the
Ascendant, or when the life-giving Sun is there. When
these planets add their vital energies to the Ascendant,
we have a person who is very apt to dissipate his forces.
People who express Aries very strongly are apt to be
quick of temper of an explosive kind, but will not hold
spite. Those with Aries on the Ascendant, or with the
Sun or Mars there, are quick to anger but also ready to
forgive.
Aries rules the head, the cerebral hemispheres of the
brain, the upper jaw, the eyes, and the face. The nose,
however, is ruled by the martial sign of Scorpio. 15 16 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Aries is hot, dry, and inflammatory. Aries people
with a slight cold or disturbance of health may have a
very high temperature. In illness their fever will often be
from three to four degrees higher than that of the persons
born under the watery or airy signs. Under planetary
afflictions these people are subject to brain fever,
dizziness, nosebleed, neuralgia, inflammation of the
cerebral hemispheres, and diseases of the brain and face.
They frequently suffer from a rush of blood to the head.
The will of the patient plays a great part in the
success of healing. People under positive signs are most
likely to respond, for they make personal effort to help
the healer, while negative-sign people are prone to
follow the line of least resistance and to be neglectful in
following the instructions of the healer.
T AURUS
Taurus has rule over the region of the neck, the ears,
palate, larynx, tonsils, thyroid gland, lower jaw, occipital
region, cerebellum, atlas, and cervical vertebrae, vocal
chords, carotid arteries, jugular vein, and the pharynx.
The Taurean is very stubborn and tenacious. Taurus
being a negative sign, when a Taurean contracts a
disease, he holds on to it tenaciously. He has great fear
of sickness, and on account of this fear he makes a poor
doctor or nurse, whereas the Arian, being under Aires,
which is a positive sign, will go into a sick room without
fear and quickly throw off the disease. If you have a
patient who has Taurus rising or the Sun in Taurus, never PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS 17 let him think he is much ill, for his fear of sickness will
often bring on a spell of it. The Taurean has a tendency
to take on flesh in middle life. Being short and thickest
as a rule, he becomes very fleshy about the neck and
base of the skull. This has a tendency to cause the
swelling of glands, tonsillitis, quinsy, and various
diseases of the organs of the neck; also polypi.
GEMINI
Gemini has rule over the arms, hands, shoulders,
lungs, thymus gland, upper ribs, trachea, bronchi,
capillaries, breath, and oxygenation of the blood.
The Gemini person is subject to nervous troubles.
Gemini being one of the common signs, a person born
with this sign rising is often very careless of his health
and habits, and on this account we find more tubercular
patients among Gemini people than among people of any
one of the other eleven signs. Gemini being classed
among the positive signs, the Gemini person can, if he is
given the least bit of help, often throw off a disease. The
diseases to which Gemini is most subject are pulmonary
troubles, bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, consumption,
pleurisy, and nervous disorders.
CANCER
When we have a horoscope to diagnose for one who
has the watery and negative Cancer rising, we may look
for one who is low in vitality; one who is very timid yet
loath to follow the advice of others. Cancer people are 18 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS apt to do the opposite from that which they are advised
to do. They are also full of suspicion, and on account of
lack of faith in others they are difficult to reach; but
when their faith has once been established, they are most
loyal and ready to cooperate. A little praise or
appreciation will often win them over. They are unduly
sensitive, and when hurt do not forget it readily. When
the Sun is in this watery sign, the native has more vitality
than when it is rising, for the Sun is the giver of life and
energy.
Cancer has rule over the stomach, diaphragm, the
mammae, upper lobes of the liver, thoracic duct,
chymification, peristalsis, the pancreas, gastric vein, and
the serum of the blood.
The afflictions which may be classed under the sign
of Cancer are indigestion, hiccough, flatulency, dropsy,
and sclerosis. Cancer people are very fond of food and
are usually hearty eaters. Consequently they are often
afflicted with diseases which originate in wrong diet;
especially do we find this so with the people who have
Saturn in Cancer. This planet has a restricting influence,
and wherever he is found he robs the corresponding
organ of its fluids. When in Cancer he gives a desire for
pastry and sweets.
LEO
When we have to deal with a patient with Leo on the
Ascendant, we have one with great vital energy, one who
will not readily succumb to disease. The Leo usually PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS 19 puts up a brave fight to overcome without calling upon
others for help, but when he gives up, he is usually very
sick; he recovers rapidly from illness, however. His pride
will not permit him as a rule to become a charge upon
others. Being a positive sign the greatest handicap to the
Leo is impulse. He feels he must do everything with a
very great amount of energy, which is detrimental to the
health of the parts of the body ruled by this vital sign: the
heart, aorta, vena cava, dorsal region of the spine, and
the spinal cord.
The Sun, which is the life giver, rules this sign of
Leo and also has rule over the vital etheric fluid coming
through the spleen, which is the gateway of the solar
forces. Through the spleen the sign of Leo draws its
strength largely. We find those born with this sign rising
very vital and full of force, especially if the Sun is also in
Leo; but by the destructive use of their surplus energy
they are often afflicted with heart trouble of various
kinds, also spinal troubles. They suffer frequently with
disturbance of the spleen, which has an effect upon the
activities of the blood, causing an excess of white blood
corpuscles, which are destroyers and not policemen of
the blood stream as medical science claims.
VIRGO
Virgo is a feminine and negative sign, the second of
the earthy triplicity, and has less power of resistance than
the fixed sign of Leo. Virgo may stand considerable
strain, however, being of a nervous and wiry 20 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS temperament. Still when the Virgoan gives up, he finds it
very hard to rise and shake off an illness. Being of a
negative disposition he is apt to let circumstances rule
him, and does not assert his will power to overcome.
Virgo is the natural sixth house sign, the house which
has rule over sickness; hence when Virgo people once
get into the clutches of sickness, they are apt to become
chronic invalids. Therefore though such people make
excellent nurses, they should be advised against this
vocation and avoid sick rooms and hospitals, for they are
like sponges and ever ready to take on the disease of
their patients.
Virgo rules the abdominal region, intestines, the
lower lobes of the liver, the spleen, the duodenum, and
the sympathetic nervous system.
The afflictions which may be classed under the sign
of Virgo are determined largely by the planets which
may be afflicted in this sign. Cramps in the intestines,
wind, colic, malnutrition, diarrhea, constipation,
peritonitis, cholera, dysentery, worms, catarrh of the
bowels, and appendicitis may result from afflictions in
Virgo.
LIBRA
Libra is one of the signs wherein the Sun is weak.
The Sun is symbolized by Samson, who is minus his
strength, for Delilah, who is the feminine Virgo, has
shorn him of his power, which was in his hair,
representing the Sun's rays. As the Sun enters Libra, it PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS 21 changes from north to south declination; and as Libra is
the sign of Saturn's exaltation, the Sun's rays at this
point, the crossing of the equator, are weakest. Libra
people on this account are not always able to rise above
physical conditions. Their moods waver like the symbol
which represents the sign, the scales. At one time
Librans are up in the seventh heaven of happiness and
optimism, but at the least mental disturbance they may
drop to the very bottom of pessimism and despair.
Idealism is well developed in the Libran. The Libran
patient should, if possible, never be discouraged in
whatever he has set his heart upon doing, for shatter his
ideals and down goes one side of the scales into the very
deepest discouragement, which often causes ill health.
The Libran should cultivate equilibrium.
Physiologically this sign rules the kidneys, the
lumbar region of the spine, the skin, the ureters, which
are the tiny ducts running between the kidneys and the
bladder, and the vasomotor system. The afflictions from
which the Libran is most likely to suffer are Bright's
disease, lumbago, disturbed urine. The disease depends
greatly upon the planets afflicting: if Saturn, there is a
scarcity of urine; if Jupiter, an excess, etc. Nephritis,
eczema, and diabetes are also diseases from which the
Libran is likely to suffer.
SCORPIO
The martial, watery sign of Scorpio is one of the
least understood signs of the entire twelve. Scorpio 22 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS produces a number of types. Usually the Scorpio person
is of a secretive, timid, retiring nature, one who does not
talk of his affairs. But there is another type of Scorpio
who is ready to argue at “the drop of the hat,” holding
out for his point, and he can become very cruel. He
usually has an explosive temper, which may, if the
horoscope has afflictions, undermine the health. The
greatest danger to the health of the Scorpio, however,
comes from the generative organs and the ducts through
which the excretions of the body pass, such as the
urethra (the small canal through which the urine passes
from the bladder outward) and the colon, including the
anus.
The bladder, the sigmoid flexure, prostate gland,
pubic bone, the red coloring matter of the blood, and the
nasal bones are also under the rule of Scorpio.
People born under this sign make good healers,
surgeons, doctors, and nurses. But there is often a cruel
and tyrannical streak in the Scorpio, and the desire
nature is strong, sometimes sensual. Low desires often
bring excesses, which may cause the following diseases,
expressing themselves according to the planets and the
afflicting aspects: syphilis, hernia, scurvy, fistula, piles,
inflammation and falling of the womb, uterine troubles,
stricture of the prostrate gland, and nasal catarrh.
SAGITTARIUS
The Sagittarian is usually the most gentle and easily
cured of all patients, for with his frank and kindly nature PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS 23 he is most trusting and ever ready to follow all the
instructions of the healer; but he will also respond to
every negative suggestion. The healer may have given
constructive advice and left the patient feeling
encouraged, but should one of his many friends (for the
Sagittarian is usually very popular and a good mixer and
therefore attracts many friends to him) suggest sickness
or tell him that he is looking bad or give him some other
remedy to follow, he is very apt to accept the suggestion.
The result is that he often retards his recovery. Therefore
it is necessary for the Sagittarian patient to be placed
under the care of someone who will protect him from
adverse suggestions.
Sagittarius rules the region of the body directly
surrounding the hips, the sacral region of the spine, the
coccygeal vertebrae, the femur, the ilium, the iliac
arteries, the sciatic nerves, and the ischium.
The Sagittarian diseases are locomotor ataxia,
sciatica, rheumatism, and hip disease.
CAPRICORN
The sign of Capricorn is an earthy sign and ruled by
the planet Saturn. Capricorn people do not yield to
disease very readily. They are of a wiry, persistent, and
stolid nature, and will suffer considerable pain before
they will succumb to illness. But once they have given in
to sickness then they are just as slow and stubborn in
holding on to it. They sometimes become
hypochondriacs, and the healer must use most diplomatic 24 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS methods to break up the crystallized condition with
which these Saturnian people clothe themselves. The
most unfortunate part of it is that if a Capricorn who is in
this mental and physical state is aware that anyone is
endeavoring to help him, he will resist help and close up
against the friend who thus approaches him. Capricorn
people are super-sensitive and very retiring. They often
form habits of entertaining gloom and despondency,
which have a deteriorating effect upon the health.
The sign of Capricorn has rule over the knees, the
skin, the joints, and the hair. The skin of a Capricorn
person is often sallow and dry.
The disease to which Capricorn is subject are
eczema, syphilis, leprosy; also dislocation of the bones.
AQUARIUS
The fixed and airy sign of Aquarius is under the rule
of two planets, the melancholy, fearful, and overanxious
Saturn, which is ordinarily termed the planet of
obstruction, and the impulsive, heedless, emotional, and
hysterical Uranus. While Aquarius is a fixed sign which
endows the native with a strong will, still when the
Aquarian is afflicted by adverse aspects between certain
planets, especially Saturn or Uranus when they are
strongly placed in the horoscope, he is prone to develop
extreme gloom, pessimism, and sensitiveness, or he is
rash and responds to the emotional Uranus. These
varying moods frequently result in ill health, which too
often takes the form of nervousness. Aquarius being a PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS 25 mental and airy sign, its natives are wiry and ambitious,
and are prone to overdo. They can never measure their
strength until the body is strained to its very limit,
therefore when they do give up they are usually in a
critical state; but they will give the healer every
opportunity to help them, for they are ever ready to
cooperate.
Physiologically the sign of Aquarius rules the lower
limbs and ankles.
The diseases with which the Aquarian may be
afflicted are varicose veins, swelling of the legs, and
nervous diseases of various kinds. One indication that
the Aquarian has when the nerves begin to get weak is
extreme sensitiveness of the skin. There is a crawling
sensation felt all over the body, as if little insects were
crawling on the skin.
PISCES
Pisces is a watery and common sign, and the people
born under it are of a lymphatic and negative nature,
very fond of luxuries, which too often lead them to seek
a life of ease. In later life they are prone to take on an
excess of soft, flabby flesh, which leads to ill health. The
Pisces people respond very readily to suggestions,
whether they are good or evil, and they will also respond
just as quickly to the influence of the healer. Do not
allow anyone who is of a too sympathetic nature to visit
the Piscean while he is ill. Of the oversympathetic type
there are too many in the world today, who think it a 26 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS social duty to call upon every sick friend and encourage
the ailing one to talk about his disease, and then extend
to him, oh, so much sympathy! The Piscean person will
enjoy the visit of the sympathizer, but when the latter has
gone, he usually has a relapse and must quickly send for
the doctor or healer. He should be placed in a very
cheerful room, with a cheerful attendant, and a sign on
the door, “No sympathetic visitors allowed.”
The Piscean is prone to drift into the habit of drink
and the use of narcotics, especially if we find an
affliction of the Moon and Neptune in the horoscope.
Pisces rules the feet, the toes, and the fibrin of the
blood. On account of their fondness for good food and an
easy life, Piscean people are subject to gout and the
swelling of the feet. CHAPTER Gêmeos RULERSHIPS AND QUALITIES

SYMPATHY AND ANTIPATHY Plutão YTHAGORAS taught that the solar system is
one mighty musical instrument; that the twelve
signs of the zodiac may be compared to the semitones of
the chromatic scale; and that the planets constitute the
seven white keys of the cosmic key board. Each sign
responds to a certain tone; some tones blend and are
harmonious, while others clash. As we find disharmony
and conflict between certain notes of a piano and
between certain strings of a harp, so do we find similar
inharmony between various signs of the zodiac and
various planets in their effect on man. The symbol of the trine is the triangle. In astrology
the trine is considered harmonious and benefic. Then we
have the signs which represent the four elements,
forming the fiery, earthy, airy, and watery triangles.
The fiery and airy signs are in harmony with each
other, and the earthy and watery triplicities are friendly; 33 34 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS but the fiery and watery will not harmonize, neither will
the earthy and the fiery signs. Planets in these various
groups of signs will express the same sympathy or
antipathy as the signs themselves. The sign triplicities
express themselves through harmony in the
temperaments and personalities of people, while the
squares express their afflictions through physical
discomforts.
Disease is really a lack of harmony between the
spirit and the personality, a conflict between the lower
and the higher man. The trines or triplicities act as
peacemakers, while the squares and oppositions place
limitations upon the spirit. The latter pair bring the
lessons which are to be learned. They exact payment of
the debts of destiny from a person for the mistakes made
and the selfishness expressed in past lives. The squares
and oppositions are most vital in their action. The
squares operate through three groups of signs which
constitute— SYMPATHY AND ANTIPATHY 35 Doctors have for years been studying the strange
sympathy between different parts of the body which they
have found manifested in the diseases of various
patients. When they find a disease in one organ, they are
in the habit of looking for the cause in another organ
which is in sympathy with the first. For instance, in
glaucoma or certain kinds of eye trouble they have
invariably found that the real cause or seat of the trouble
was in the stomach or the kidneys. In certain types of
throat trouble and in goiter a weakened heart has
frequently been found to be the cause.
The four points of the circle of the cardinal or
equinoctial signs—namely, Aries the eyes, Libra the
kidneys, Cancer the stomach, and Capricorn the knees—
are closely in sympathy with one another, and trouble in
one will frequently manifest in one of the other signs of
this circle. For instance, if we find Saturn in the sign of
its fall, Cancer, and afflicted, digestive troubles ensue
and invariably the kidneys will be disturbed; sometimes
stiff knee joints are the result. Eye troubles are
frequently developed as a result of wrong eating. People
with Saturn in Cancer are extremists in their selection of
food. They have strange likes and dislikes.
The second vicious circle is that of the fixed signs:
Taurus the throat; Scorpio the generative organs, rectum,
urethra, and nose; Leo the heart and spine; Aquarius the
legs, below the knees. When the organs of voice or the
tonsils are operated upon in childhood there will be
disturbances at puberty and later troubles in childbirth. 36 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Great sympathy is found between the sex organs and the
organs of speech. The removal of parts of the sex organs
causes change of voice, the male voice becoming
feminine, and the female voice masculine. Valvular heart
trouble often causes the swelling of the ankles.
The third group of squares we find composed of the
common or mutable signs, corresponding to the cadent
houses. The 6th house, which is correlated to Virgo, and
the 12th house, correlated to Pisces, are especially vital
in the horoscope, for they are respectively the house of
sickness and the house of confinement and hospitals. We
find great sympathy between these two signs and houses.
Common signs are the most productive of sickness, and
more hopeless invalids are found among common-sign
people than in any other group for the reason that their
will power is not overly strong.
Two common signs are ruled by Mercury, which has
dominion over the breath, nerves, and sense perception;
and one by Jupiter, which has rule over the fibrin of the
blood, the arterial circulation, and the liver. Gemini rules
the lungs, and through these organs the blood is
oxidized. Virgo has rule over the intestines, sympathetic
nervous system, and spleen. How often we hear the
remark, “I caught cold (or pneumonia) due to wet feet,”
involving Gemini and Pisces. Many more examples
could be cited of the action of the vicious circles. CHAPTER IV THE SCIENCE OF RIGHT LIVING I N the previous chapters we studied the properties
of the signs of the zodiac, and had the anatomical
groupings so arranged as to make it easy for the student
of astro-diagnosis to study them. It is very necessary that
he become familiar with the basic properties of the signs
as well as of the planets. It is impossible to make any
headway in the art of diagnosing a chart unless the
student has considerable knowledge of the zodiac and
the properties of the signs and planets. He should also
familiarize himself with the science of progression. All
these different phases he will have to make use of before
he can become proficient in diagnosis so that he may tell
what certain positions, aspects, and planets indicate. It is
essential that he understand the temperament and
character of the patient before he can really be sure of his
diagnosis of disease.
To find the key to a disease and the reason why a
man or woman has become an invalid, whether the
disease is organic, and whether the patient has broken 37 38 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the laws of nature, is just as necessary as the diagnosis
itself. What is the good of knowing what kind of a
disease is shown in the horoscope if you cannot show the
patient where he is breaking the laws of nature? Disease
in ninety-five cases out of every hundred is due to wrong
methods of living, and to be able to point these out to the
patient leads to the cure. First, you must remove the
cause, and then the cure will follow as a natural result.
The secret of the success of the progressive doctor
lies in the fact that he will never, if he can possibly avoid
it, diagnose the disease to his patient directly. He will
only give advice and prescribe, and sometimes he may
give a hint regarding the cause of disease. He will also
give directions as to food and methods of living, and tell
why the patient should discontinue certain habits. From
this diplomatic handling of the patient comes the doctor's
greatest success. He will never express a discouraging
word. He never robs the patient of his hope, and when he
leaves the home of the patient, he leaves with a smile
and an encouraging word.
There are exceptions, however, for there are doctors,
and they are not in the minority by any means, who are
posing under the name “physician”, but who will predict
death or the necessity of operations of various kinds
before they have really and truly diagnosed the disease.
Under the care of such a physician the poor patient is
frequently doomed, for the one from whom he has
expected relief has really robbed him of hope. So we
want to impress it very strongly upon our students that THE SCIENCE OF RIGHT LIVING 39 never at any time should they predict death. Also never
at any time tell the patient that he has heart trouble, that
he is in danger of insanity, or that he is afflicted with the
dread disease of tuberculosis. From such statements he
would get the thought of fear. Fear is usually worse in its
effect upon the mind of the negative one than the disease
itself. Ninety patients out of every hundred are ill
because of wrong and dangerous methods of eating, ill
because of fear, or ill because of the lack of will power
to resist temptations. In fact, all disease is the result of
ignorant violation of the laws of nature. This may not
have occurred in this life alone. It may have been
brought over from a life previous, and thus the patient
has latent weaknesses.
So we may realize that to be of real help in the
healing of the sick the healer or the diagnostician must
have sufficient knowledge to be able to give the
suffering one instruction in right living. Our advice to
the reader would be to study carefully and memorize if
possible the lessons in astro-diagnosis which have just
preceded; also to familiarize himself with the properties
of the various foods and their combinations, for you may
expect if you tell a patient to change his diet that he will
ask you what he should eat. One may see from all these
considerations how very necessary it is to get a sane and
safe knowledge of the science of right living. CHAPTER V
THE MENTALITY O UR first thought when judging the mental
qualities of a patient is to find the position of
Mercury. First note the sign in which it is placed, then
the house, and thirdly the aspects which this planet of
reason is making.
To save time and space in these lessons we will not
give the effects of Mercury in the different signs of the
zodiac, but will refer the reader to The Message of the
Stars, pages 201 to 207, also pages 549, 550, where he
will find the basic qualities of Mercury in the twelve
signs. These should be studied very carefully, and this
study will give a foundation upon which to base the
judgment.
The next planet to consider is the Moon. If there is a
good aspect between the Moon and Mercury, especially
if these two planets are well placed in the angles and in
signs in which they can express their best qualities, we
may expect the patient will be able to cooperate with the
healer. If Mercury, however, is conjunct Saturn, we find
a mind which is stubborn, slow, and subject to
melancholia. When Mercury is trine or sextile to Saturn, 40 THE MENTALITY 41 a well-balanced mind with good reasoning qualities will
develop, and a retentive memory is shown. When Mars
or Uranus is in conjunction with Mercury, the patient is
of a high-strung, emotional, erratic type with little
control over the mind; but should Mars or Uranus be
sextile or trine to Mercury, it will have a tendency to
quicken the mental faculties, giving impulse. If we find
Mercury or the Moon afflicted by Neptune, the mind is
inclined toward unhealthy and unnatural conditions,
obsession, religious mania, mediumship, drink, or drugs.
Observe the house and sign in which these planets are
placed to find how they tend to express themselves.
Neptune being the higher octave of Mercury, this planet
has a strong influence on the higher mind. Neptune when
afflicted by Uranus or the Moon gives tendencies
towards undesirable experiences in psychism. When
Neptune is afflicted by Mars, especially when it is in
conjunction with this fiery planet, the native is often
tempted to use hypnotism or black magic upon others,
and is himself prone to become the victim of those who
unscrupulously use these dreadful practices on others.
When the mental afflictions are in the eighth or the
twelfth house they have a more subtle influence than
elsewhere. Afflictions in the eighth house may give the
mind suicidal tendencies, but if in the twelfth house—
being the house of self-undoing, hospitals, prisons, and
insane asylums—they may cause confinement in some
institution. 42 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS We wish to impress it very firmly upon the mind of
the reader: never, never at any time base a diagnosis on
only one or two aspects, but always upon the entire
horoscope. To illustrate the dangers of superficial
judgment we will take the horoscope of a man who had
Mercury in Capricorn in the sixth house, making only
one aspect, which was a weak square to Neptune.
Judging the horoscope quickly one would say that he had
a dull mentality, but as a boy he stood at the head of his
class. In spelling and mathematics he was very bright. As
a man he has reached a high status among his associates.
He is a leader in a line of work which requires executive
ability and a keen mentality. To illustrate our point we
will note what the other planets indicated. He had seven
planets in airy signs, five planets in mental signs, the
Moon and Neptune both well aspected and in angles, the
Sun and Moon in fixed signs, and fixed and cardinal
signs on the four angles. When summing up the entire
horoscope we can well see why this man reached such a
high position in mental work with a weak Mercury. So
we want to impress it firmly upon our readers to use their
reasoning powers before giving a judgment on a
horoscope, whether it is for mental, moral, spiritual, or
physical qualities. CHAPTER VI THE SIXTH HOUSE INFLUENCES A FTER we have carefully studied the mental
qualities of our patient we must try to find the
strength of the will. The Ascendant as a rule gives us a
key to will and to the mentality. Now we will see what
bearing the 6th house has on the matter. The 6th house is
the house of sickness, and very often gives the key to the
patient's condition. We therefore first look to the ruler of
this house to see what it indicates, in what sign and
house it is placed, and what the nature of the sign is and
what part of the body is ruled by it. Next we must see
what planets are aspecting the ruler of this house of
sickness.
Let us suppose that Aquarius is on the cusp of the
6th house. Then we would look for the two planets,
Uranus and Saturn, which have rule over this sign.
Naturally they will have rule over the health of the
patient to a very great extent. Now, suppose that Uranus
is in the sign of Virgo and on the Ascendant, as we find
it in the horoscope of a man who was born April 22nd,
1881, at 2 Plutão .M. Uranus rising gives the key to the nature,
which is one of great impulse. The co-ruler of the 6th 43 44 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS house is Saturn. We find in the greater number of
horoscopes that Saturn is the afflicter. He is the
taskmaster that brings to man the needed lessons. Saturn
in the horoscope which we have under consideration is in
Taurus, intercepted in the 9th house and in conjunction
with the Sun and Jupiter. Saturn is not in this case the
worst afflicter.
We now consider the planets which may be in the
6th house. Here we find the vacillating Moon in
Aquarius and square to Venus and Neptune. The latter
two planets are in the sign of Taurus in the 9th house.
Here we have the whole trouble. The Moon and Venus
are both feminine, indicating women. The Moon is the
ruler of the 11th house, and thus represents women
friends, who tempted and caused this man to respond to
the Uranus-Mars impulse. So we may look for trouble
through overindulgence of the desires, which are
indicated by the planets in Taurus and by Mars, the latter
ruling the sign of Scorpio, which governs sex. Hence we
may expect that wine and women will bring this man to
his undoing.
Note that Mercury is in the 8th house, and aspected
very weakly by a semi-sextile of Saturn, the Sun, Jupiter,
and Neptune. Mercury in Aries works under impulse. It
being practically unaspected in this sign and Uranus
being in opposition to Mars indicate a lack of
forethought. With these conditions and having a
common sign on the Ascendant this man was a perfect
slave to his passions and desires. Here we may see what THE SIXTH HOUSE INFLUENCES 45 the Virgo Ascendant with Uranus in conjunction shows
regarding the will. A decided lack of will power is
indicated. With Virgo, the natural 6th house sign on the
Ascendant, and the Sun in Taurus, this man was an easy
victim of disease, for both Virgo and Taurus have a
decided fear of sickness.
We must never base our diagnosis on one or two
afflictions, but we must study all the signs and planets
very carefully. Some horoscopes show very plainly what
is the matter, and at a glance we can see from a few
aspects what the disease may be. But other horoscopes
hide the symptoms, just as the doctor often finds it to be
the case with his patients. Some tell him at once where
the disease is, while others are a puzzle and the disease
may be difficult to locate. Therefore the astrologer must
study and reason to be very sure that he has the correct
diagnosis. CHAPTER VII
PRELIMINARY STEPS IN DIAGNOSING W E ARE now ready to begin the real work of
reading and diagnosing a chart. First we must
know what the rising sign indicates, for by this we get
the key to the patient's disposition. The Ascendant
indicates the general nature of the planetary baptism
which a man received at birth, and which will influence
him all through this physical life. According to the stamp
of the stellar forces at birth will a man's tendencies be.
Remember, we do not say fate, but tendencies, for man
has the power within him to change to a very great extent
the influences that are shown in the horoscope. We must
admit that the horoscope is the result of his past living
and that it indicates a certain probable destiny. If he
allows the stars to rule him, why then he becomes the
victim of fate; but the wise man is he who rules his stars.
The Ascendant indicates the general characteristics
and tendencies which are latent within a man. Therefore
this should be the starting point of our diagnosis. Then
we must see how the four angles are represented. If we
find common signs—namely, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, 46 PRELIMINARY STEPS IN DIAGNOSING 47 and Pisces—on the cusps, we have a patient who will
respond quickly to suggestions, and while he will listen
to the healer and may seemingly try to cooperate with
him, still on account of his wavering tendencies, or let us
say the weakness of will of the common-sign person, he
is prone to forget to follow directions. One's instructions
must be repeated often or the common sign patient is apt
to forget them.
If the Ascendant and the four angles, however, are
occupied by the four cardinal signs—namely, Aries,
Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn—you may expect
cooperation from your patient; but if Aries is on the
Ascendant, you must let him think that he is doing the
work himself. Never order an Arian to do anything, but
diplomatically ask him if he does not think so and so
would be good for him, for Aries dislikes following the
dictates of another. When he does follow your
instructions, however, he will do it with great force, and
impulsively. We sometimes hear of people who follow
the doctor's orders to the extent that they will take a
whole box of pills at one dose. Well, such is the Aries
patient. He must have results quickly or he will lose his
interest. The cardinal sign people as a rule are willing to
cooperate with the healer, and they will also make every
effort to overcome disease.
The fixed sign people—namely, those under Taurus,
Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius—are creatures of habit; that
is, they are so fixed that when they get into a rut, or if
they form a habit, they are very difficult for the healer to 48 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS handle. This habit, which may be at the very bottom of
the trouble and have caused the disease, they hold on to
with tenacity. The fixed sign people have great
determination, and when once they are aroused they
cooperate fully with the healer. Taurus and Scorpio
people may at times display a stubborn nature which is
hard to combat, and they are also so full of fear that the
healer must be very careful of his suggestions in their
presence. He must always be optimistic and give
suggestions of hope.
The healer should be familiar with the temperament
and disposition of each sign, and realize that if the ruler
of the sign is afflicted or if malefic planets are in the
sign, the response will be very different than it will when
the best side of the sign is expressed. Remember, the
unafflicted magnanimous, jovial, and loving Leo is a
very different person from the afflicted blustering,
bragging, quarrelsome, stubborn Leo. Similarly, we may
find two sides to each sign. Let us study the signs and
their rulers very carefully. Note also very carefully what
aspects the ruler of the Ascendant makes, for this planet
is usually the life ruler and has a great influence on the
life of the native.
The next step is to study the mind, for if the
mentality is weak, the healer finds his work most
difficult. In the mind of man lies the power which may
be used to control disease. A strong and well-aspected
Mercury will guide a man into a safe and sane path of
living, and such a person is not prone to succumb to PRELIMINARY STEPS IN DIAGNOSING 49 disease. But the afflicted Mercury often leads man into
temptations, and if the desire nature is strong and the
mind weak, we may expect that the patient will not have
the will to cooperate with the healer. Hence we may say
that the healer must study the chart very carefully in
order to trace the latent tendencies of his patient. When
he has traced them, he is able to get to the first cause.
Remember, everything in life has a first cause, and to get
an understanding of a case we must go back to the
beginning. CHAPTER VIII HINTS AND HELPS FOR THE HEALER
1—NEVER, NEVER predict the time of death to
your patient. Let the reader repeat this injunction so as to
impress it firmly upon his mind. If you predict DEATH
to a patient, YOU may become his executioner, and
before your God you will be held accountable for a great
wrong. There is an old adage which says, “While there's
life, there's HOPE.” No matter how strong the affliction
may be in the horoscope, sometimes Divine Providence
may lend a hand, and very serious periods may be passed
with the proper help.
2—The LAW does not permit a layman to diagnose
disease for others; only the licensed physician may do
this.
3—The wise healer will NEVER discuss disease
with his patient, nor will he ever diagnose to the patient.
He will keep his knowledge for his own use in healing. Júpiter —At all times keep the patient's mind, if possible,
from thoughts of disease, and before leaving give him
some pleasant thought to help him along. Laugh and joke 50 HINTS AND HELPS FOR THE HEALER 51 with him; always leave him with a smile, for
cheerfulness is half the cure.
5—Refrain from asking him the question, “How do
you feel?” This has a tendency to throw his thoughts
back to his physical body, which in illness is a good
thing for him to forget. Let your first words of greeting
be, “What a beautiful day! I am glad to see you.” Any
greeting is good that will bring cheer, and help the
sufferer to forget his pain.
5A—Never discuss the patient's horoscope with him.
If he insists however, then give him encouraging hints
only, but NEVER tell him of an impending crisis.
6—Sick people often have a morbid desire to probe
into the future, to know of any impending crisis or of
possible death, especially if they have some knowledge
of astrology. The healer should request the patient to
discontinue the study of his own horoscope while he is
under his care; otherwise he will find that many adverse
suggestions obtained from such study will appear in the
mind of the patient, which will hinder the healing.
6A—There are lines of force running between the
two poles of a magnet, and there is in all nature a
positive and negative side. The human body is a most
powerful magnet expressing both the positive and the
negative aspects. When a man is ill, he expresses the
negative side of his nature, and therefore the healer
should (and will if he is the right healer) express the
opposite aspect, namely the positive. When this is done,
the patient will respond quickly, and the healing will be 52 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS successful. Therefore it is very necessary that the healer
express positiveness and cheerfulness in the sickroom.
7—When a man is ill, his power of resistance is at its
lowest ebb, and he is very sensitive to influences from
without. At that time the currents of the vital body are
turned inward, and he is apt to attract thoughts and
magnetism from others which, if negative, will have an
adverse effect upon him. When a man is in good health,
the vital body ethers radiate outward and thereby keep
out negative elements, also throw out impurities.
8—When one is ill, his power of resistance is low,
and at that time the vibrations of the healer have a
greater effect than at other times; his influence is
therefore powerful either for good or evil. If the healer's
thoughts are not pure, if his life is not clean, then his
influence on the patient is not good. Therefore it is most
necessary that the healer LIVE THE LIFE of purity,
otherwise he can do more harm than good. Mercúrio —If the healer's Saturn is on the Ascendant or in
the sixth house of the patient, he will have little success
in helping the latter.
10—A healer with the Sun in Scorpio or with
Scorpio on the Ascendant is usually successful.
11—The Sun in fiery signs gives good healing
power, also greater power over the diseases of those
signs than is possessed by others.
12—People born with common signs on the angles
or with the Sun in a common sign make the best nurses. HINTS AND HELPS FOR THE HEALER 53 They have power to soothe the sick, and they bring a
quieting influence into the sick room.
13—When Saturn is the afflicter, the skin is often
very dry, and the vitality low. Rub the skin briskly with
rough bath gloves to stimulate circulation.
14—People with Virgo on the Ascendant or with the
Sun in Virgo make good nurses.
15—To calm a patient who has an afflicted Mars, it
is well to choose a Saturn hour.
16—People with Saturn in the sixth house rarely
make a success in the art of healing.
17—When the patient is suffering with nervous
trouble, but Mars is not afflicted, it is well to use a Sun
or a Mars hour for manipulations or ministrations.
18—When the Moon is increasing in light—namely,
between the new and the full—stimulants have the
greatest effect and sedatives the least.
19—When the Moon is conjunction Saturn,
stimulants have very little effect; but should the Moon be
conjoined to Mars, especially if Mars is strong in the
horoscope or is in the sign of Aries, then the healer
should be most careful in administering stimulants. CHAPTER IX
APHORISMS
1—The Moon may be regarded as the giver and the
taker of life; that is, the Moon acts as a medium in
carrying the life forces from the Sun to the earth and
man, and the Moon forces also eventually produce death.
2—When the Moon is full, the tides are higher, the
bones are fuller of marrow, and oysters are fuller than at
any other time. The temperature is then also highest in
fevers.
3—During the first half of life, particularly in
childhood, the Moon has greatest rule, and during the
latter half of life the Sun has the strongest influence. Júpiter —The Moon has great influence over insane
people—that is, lunatics—and over hysterical, epileptic,
and nervous patients. These patients feel the changes of
the Moon very greatly; especially are they very restless
during the full of the Moon. They should never sleep
with the Moon shining on them.
5—At the new Moon the material forces are
weakest. The period of the waning Moon—namely
between the full and the new—is strongest for spiritual
work, for at that time the influence of the Sun is greatest. 54 APHORISMS 55 6—Do not perform an operation when the Moon is
in the sign which rules the part of the body to be
operated upon. Ptolemy says, “Pierce not with iron that
part of the body which may be governed by the sign
actually occupied by the Moon.”
7—Operations performed at the exact change of the
Moon are rarely successful. Choose the time for an
operation when the Moon is waxing or, as it is
commonly termed, in the light of the Moon. Do not
operate when the Sun is in the sign which rules the part
of the body to be cut.
8—The Moon revolves around the zodiac in about
twenty-eight days. Disease reaches a turning point every
seven days. Starting from the place of the Moon at the
beginning of the illness, a change may be expected in
seven days (the square), on the fourteenth day (the
opposition), and on the twenty-first day (another square). Mercúrio —The Moon rules acute disease, the Sun chronic.
10—It is well to watch the squares and the
opposition of the Moon to the transiting Sun, Mars, and
Saturn when operating.
11—The Moon has greatest rule over the health of
the woman while the Sun influences the health of the
man.
12—From the new to the full Moon stimulants
produce the most effect and sedatives are the weakest;
decrease the dose of the one and increase the other.
13—When the increasing Moon is in good aspect to
the radical Jupiter or Venus, cardiac stimulation 56 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS produces the most lasting results. Palpitation is most
efficiently treated when the Moon is decreasing and
aspecting the above planets favorably. Apply heart
stimulants with extreme care when the Moon is evilly
aspected to these planets and especially when it is dark
or waning.
14—Good aspects to the radical Moon from the
transiting Jupiter and Venus are very helpful.
15 Saturn, when placed in the sixth house of the
horoscope at birth, has a tendency to lower the vitality.
16—The sign in which the Sun is at birth is a very
vital locality in the horoscope, its influence varying
according as it is cardinal, fixed, or common. Also the
house containing the Sun, be it cadent, succedent, or an
angle, is important. From the strength of the Sun you
may often judge the response which you will get from
your patient.
17—Benefic aspects between the radical Sun and
Mars give great vitality and resistance to disease. An evil
aspect between the Sun and Mars is better from a health
standpoint than no aspect at all.
18—Aspects to the Ascendant and the Midheaven
are often unreliable unless you are absolutely sure of the
minute of birth, and as clocks are frequently off time and
there is much confusion in regard to different kinds of
time, these two points should be used with great
discretion. APHORISMS 57 19—Planets that are in critical degrees (See
Simplified Scientific Astrology, page 81) have a greater
influence either for good or evil than in other degrees.
20—Certain fixed stars have a powerful influence on
disease. Especially should the three following nebular
spots be watched: the Pleiades, 29 degrees of Taurus;
Ascelli, 6 degrees of Leo; and Antares, 8 degrees of
Sagittarius.
21—A child with no aspect between the Sun and
Mars is subject to many children’s diseases.
22—A patient with many planets in airy signs
requires more air in the sleeping apartment than others
do. Planets in fiery signs incline one to require much
sunlight; and people with planets in watery or earthy
signs suffer from too much sunlight.
23—With fixed signs on the angles and afflictions in
common signs, the native overcomes disease. When
common signs are on the angles and the afflictions in
fixed signs, he is more apt to succumb to disease.
24—A well-aspected Sun when in the sign of Aries
or Leo gives great vitality and an ability to throw off
disease.
25—When people with Aries rising or the Sun or
Mars in the sign of Aries at birth are ill, their
temperature rises much higher than that of other patients,
and they suffer much more quickly from fever, for there
is a tendency of the blood to rush to the head and to the
skin. 58 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS 26—An affliction between the Sun and Saturn or a
square between the Moon and the Sun gives low vitality.
When this condition is found in the horoscope it is well
during illness to watch the progressed Moon in aspect to
these afflicted plants, and also especially the transits of
the new and full moons.
27—Retrograde planets give very little help in
disease. Regardless of whether they are in good or evil
aspect, their influence is latent until they turn direct; then
we may look for their awakened influence.
28—Planets when they turn from retrograde to direct
are slow in motion. Their influence while in this slow
motion is not as vital or as powerful as when they are
swiftly moving.
29—Planets are strong when in signs of their own
nature, also when in aspect to planets which are in
compatible signs.
30—When the hour of birth is not known a fairly
accurate diagnosis may be obtained by using a flat chart;
i.e., by placing Aries on the first house, Taurus on the
second, Gemini on the third, etc.
31—Saturn's influence is contracting, while Mars' is
loosening.
32—The Sun rules the vital fluid which is
specialized through the spleen. When the Sun is afflicted
at birth, disease frequently occurs when progressions of
the planets afflict the Sun.
33—When the radical Sun or Moon is within orb of
the Pleiades in 29 degrees of Taurus, the Ascelli in Leo APHORISMS 59 6, or Antares in Sagittarius 8, trouble with the eyes is
indicated, especially if Saturn, Mars, or Uranus is also at
one of these spots.
34—Mercury in the twelfth house, afflicted by the
Sun, Saturn, Uranus or Mars, also Mercury in Capricorn,
the house of Saturn, when afflicted by a malefic will
affect the hearing.
35—Watch the malefic planets when they are placed
in either the sixth or the twelfth house, the sixth being
the house which has rule over sickness, and the twelfth
having rule over hospitals and places of confinement.
36—It is necessary to observe the antipathy between
certain signs and planets. For instance, the fiery Mars
may be posited in the water sign Pisces, or the cold,
earthy Saturn in the fiery sign of Aries. When a planet is
in the sign of its detriment, it may especially become a
menace to health.
37—The place where Saturn is found in the
horoscope is most likely to be a weak place in the
physical body, the place most easily affected by disease.
38—The Lucifer spirits from Mars aid in
maintaining the heat of the blood by dissolving the iron,
a Mars metal, and enabling the blood to attract oxygen, a
Sun element.
39—A patient with the planet Mercury in square
aspect to Saturn is apt to suffer from gloom. A cheerful,
sunny room should be chosen, with rose-colored walls.
40—The sign of Leo on the Ascendant with the Sun 60 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS in its exaltation sign, Aries, gives abundant vitality and
the power to throw off disease.
41—If a disease is caused by an affliction of Mars,
we may look for help when the progressed Moon reaches
a good aspect of Venus. When the disease is of a
Saturnian nature, we may expect the greatest help when
the Moon aspects Jupiter. Note the symbol of Venus, the
“higher octave” of Mars, and that of Jupiter, the “higher
octave” of Saturn; in each case the latter symbol is the
inversion of the former.
42—If the Moon is in conjunction with Saturn at the
beginning of disease, we may expect that the disease will
be of long duration.
43—Disease related to the Moon is of an acute
nature and may change within twenty-eight days, but
when the disease is related to the Sun, it is of a more
chronic nature and likely to be of longer duration and
more stubborn in resisting treatment. CHAPTER X DIAGNOSING FROM THE HANDS
AND FINGERNAILS T HE astrologer often finds himself at a great
disadvantage in his reading and diagnosing in
that the patient is frequently mistaken in the hour of birth
or is not able to give any time. Also in seven out of every
ten cases in which the native thinks he has the right time,
the horoscope when corrected by events or rectified is
found to be wrong in this particular. People are
constantly coming to the Rosicrucian Headquarters with
horoscopes which they have erected or have had some
professional astrologer set up, and in numerous cases in
which they have been positive they had the correct time
of birth the rising sign does not tally with their personal
appearance and temperament.
In one instance a woman claimed to have Pisces
rising, but when we met her personally we at once
concluded that she had the first degrees of Aries on the
Ascendant, for she had red hair a decided ram's profile, a
prominent Roman nose, and full lips, which, if you read
The Message of the Stars, you will find tally with Aries.
Another woman came to Headquarters claiming to have 61 62 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Leo on the Ascendant, but she had a slender little body, a
long face with decidedly receding chin, long slender
conical fingers, and long nails—a perfect picture of
Virgo. One case came to our notice of an extremely tall
woman. The hour of birth she gave brought Taurus on
the Ascendant, but her personal appearance was very
similar to that of Gemini. The horoscope had many
planets in the signs indicating height: the Sun, Jupiter,
Mercury, and Neptune were in Gemini, and the Moon Diagram A HANDS AND FINGER NAILS 63 and Venus in Aries. This would give her length of arm
and upper body. At first appearance we doubted her
rising sign of Taurus, but when we examined her
fingernails they were found to be the perfect Taurean
type. Taurus was also indicated by the heavy jaw and full
neck. A Gemini person's nails are small and the neck
slender.
Diagram “A” will give the reader a key to the pure
types of fingernails, correlated to the signs of the zodiac.
Horoscopes with many planets in one sign will change
the nails. In time the student will be able by using 64 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS this chart to detect the characteristics of any type. Note
how the types harmonize. Fixed sign nails are broad,
showing great persistence and determination. The signs
ruled by Venus, Taurus and Libra, give a more rounded
nail. The fingers are well-shaped and long, and the
mount of Venus, which is at the base of the thumb, is
quite rounded and full. We could write much more on
the hands and their characteristics, as compared with the
horoscope, but as this chapter is especially written to
help in the diagnosis of disease, we will confine
ourselves largely to this matter.
It is not very difficult to detect diseases which are
latent. For instance, look at Diagram No. 1. We see a
large, broad nail. This is similar to the pure Leo type.
With heart trouble latent, as in case No. 5A, where the
impulsive Mars is on the Ascendant, square to Venus,
indicating poor circulation and a weak heart, we will find
that the little half-moons at the base of the nail are blue
in color, and the lines in the palms of the hands are also
blue. When heart trouble has developed to a chronic
stage and is deep-seated, we find the nails ridged
lengthwise, as in Diagram No. 1, and the corners turned
upward away from the flesh, as in Diagram No. 2. A
horoscope which will illustrate this case may be found in
The Message of the Stars, figure 3 on page 625.
The nail shown in Diagram No. 3 is characteristic of
cases such as No. 10A. The nail which indicates liver
trouble is usually large in size but longer than No. 1 or 2.
The nail wedges into the flesh on the sides, and is HANDS AND FINGER NAILS 65 usually of a yellowish tint. The lines of the palm are also
yellow. Remember when looking into the palm of the
hand that the color of the lines is a valuable clue to the
health of the patient. If in good health the lines should be
of a soft pink; if the blood is impoverished, the lines are
pale and white; if the patient is feverish, the lines are red;
if the liver is out of order, they are yellow; and if the
heart action is wrong, the color is blue.
In Diagram No. Júpiter , we have a nail which is generally
found on the hands of people who have common or
watery signs on the angles. Many planets in common or
watery signs produce what is called the psychic type.
People with long, slender, clawlike fingers and nails are
supersensitive and lacking in strength and vitality. This
type of nail is often found on the hands of the idle rich,
women who nurse a lap dog instead of a child and
always have a box of chocolates at their side. Long,
slender, well-shaped hands and nails belong to the
psychic type, and when the nails are ridged lengthwise
and the color of the nail is pale, it is an indication of a
tendency to weakness of the lungs. People with long,
slender nails are usually susceptible to colds and coughs.
Nail No. 5 belongs to the nervous person who is
intellectually inclined and prone to overdo.
Diagram No. 6 is that of a nail which indicates the
person who frequently bites his nails. It shows one who
has little control over his temper and whose feelings are
very easily hurt. Such people are always carrying a chip
on their shoulder and always looking for slights. 66 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS THE THUMB
A well-balanced thumb indicates ability to control
the emotions, including anger. But where the thumb is
short and the end of it is club-shaped with a short nail,
there is no control whatever over anger and things easily
turn red before the eyes. The thumb is a wonderful indicator of character and
must be taken into consideration when diagnosing from
the hand. In Diagram B we see that the mount of Venus
and the thumb are both a little too heavy. This is a
typical Taurean thumb with the mount of Venus very
large, indicating a very strong desire nature. The thumb HANDS AND FINGER NAILS 67 is short and thick, showing a lack of will power to rule
the desires. When the thumb is long and well shaped, it
is an indication of high ideals and the will to carry them
out.
In a well-proportioned thumb the first phalanx
should occupy two-fifths and the second phalanx threefifths of the length of the thumb. The tip of the thumb
should reach the middle joint of the first finger. A very
long thumb indicates that a person is obstinate,
headstrong; a very short one indicates lack of logic and a
constant changing from one thing to another. If the
thumb is very thick throughout its entire length, the
desires and tastes are more or less coarse and primitive,
and the person is lacking in tack and refinement. If the
thumb is very wide, especially at the tip, it indicates one
who “sees red” easily, often one who has an
ungovernable temper; it also indicates stubbornness. The
patient who has a normally developed thumb will carry
out the physician's orders.
If the first phalanx of the thumb is very long and the
second one is short, it indicates one who is reckless and
whose actions are not controlled by reason. If the first
phalanx is short and the second very long it indicates a
talker, but not a doer. Such a person is mistrustful of
everybody and lacks self-control.
The mount of Luna is located on the little finger side
of the palm and extends from about the middle of the
palm to the wrist. When large and full it indicates
excessive emotion and imaginations, but when properly 68 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS proportioned it gives a well balanced mind. It is this
mount of the Moon and lines found upon it which give
the diagnostician a clue to mental afflictions and
designate the lunar person.
INDICATIONS FROM THE FINGERNAILS
Long, slender nails curving inward toward the flesh:
scrofulous and impure blood, weakness of the lungs, and
throat trouble.
White spots on the nails: anemia, impoverished
blood, nervousness.
Long nails, thin and brittle: weak vitality,
negativeness, timidity.
Black or blue spots on the half-moons: poison in
blood, obstructed circulation, or restricted heart action.
The shape of the nails should be taken into consideration
before making a decision; see diagrams on page 63.
Well-rounded and clear-cut half-moons on nails
indicate good circulation; if pale pink, they indicate
health; if dark blue, see page 64 for meaning.
Nails whose top surface is concave indicate spinal
weakness.
Patients who have long smooth hands, the flesh soft
and smooth, the fingers flexible, the nails white in color,
and especially when the nails wedge tightly into the side
of the finger and the wedge portion is colored, may be
said to have been born tired. They will make little
attempt to help the healer; they would prefer to have the
Invisible Helpers do the work for them. PART Gêmeos DIAGNOSIS FROM HOROSCOPES CHAPTER XI
NO. 1—A LESSON IN DIRECTING Female, born January 27, 1865, 5:15 Plutão .M.
INSTEAD of using this horoscope for the diagnosis
of disease, we will use it to illustrate the art of directing,
and judging the crisis and the duration of the disease. 70 A LESSON IN DIRECTING 71 We find the fixed sign of Leo on the Ascendant, with
the cardinal signs of Aries and Libra on the 10th and 4th
cusps respectively; the fixed signs of Taurus and Scorpio
intercepted. In this horoscope we have two rulers; the
ruler of the Ascendant, the Sun, which is in the sign of
its fall in Aquarius and near the cusp of the 7th house;
and the dynamic Mars, which is the ruler of the 10th
house, placed on the cusp of the 11th house in a critical
degree of the sign of Gemini. Mars is sextile to Neptune
in the 9th house and trine to the Sun in the 6th house.
Therefore we may look to the Sun and Mars as having
the greatest influence on the life of this woman.
Now let us find the afflictions which were
responsible for the sickness which overtook her. We find
Jupiter, which has rule over the arterial blood, in its own
sign of Sagittarius in the 5th house, square to Venus
which rules the venous circulation, and which is exalted
in the watery sign of Pisces in the 8th house. Jupiter is in
opposition to Uranus in the sign of Gemini and the 11th
house. Venus is also square to Uranus. Now what do
these afflictions from the common signs indicate? We
have had similar indications in the horoscopes of those
who were afflicted with tuberculosis of the lungs. Venus
and Jupiter both so strong by sign and afflicted by
Uranus, this last-named planet being in Gemini, which
has rule over the lungs, would naturally interfere with
oxygenation, also giving a tendency to coughs and colds. 72 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS On January 21, 1909, this woman contracted a heavy
cold which culminated in double pneumonia. The
adjusted calculation date (calculated as taught on page
470, The Message of the Stars) is August 16, 1864.
We will now progress the planets from August 16,
1908, which corresponds to their places in the ephemeris
on March 12, 1865. By adding the distance which the
principal planets move in 5 months, we find that in
January 1909 the progressed Sun was in 22°22’ of
Pisces; the Moon was in 27°28’ of Virgo; Mars was in
21 degrees of Gemini; Jupiter in 27°19’ of Sagittarius;
Venus in 7°50’ of Taurus; Mercury in 17°16’ of Pisces.
Now to judge the kind of sickness we must see what
aspects were made between the progressed and radical
planets bearing on the organic weakness of the lungs and
poor circulation of the blood as shown in the radix. We
first look for the afflictions of the planets in common
signs, and find that the Sun had progressed to the
conjunction of the radical Venus in Pisces, which made a
square to the radical Jupiter. Mars had progressed to the
opposition of the radical Jupiter, and was square to the
progressed Sun. We also find that the progressed Moon
was square to the radical Uranus in the sign of Gemini,
indicating the lungs.
The above aspects of the progressed planets to the
radical were a very severe affliction and especially since
they were from the common signs.
There are three points to be taken into consideration
in reading a horoscope: the radical chart is as the face of A LESSON IN DIRECTING 73 the clock; the progressed planets are the hour hand; and
the daily transits and the new and full moons may be
compared to the minute hand which tells the exact time.
The progressed aspects alone will not act; there must be
an exciting factor. The transits act as the match that
lights the fuse, and the transiting Moon with its aspects
and its lunations is the time marker.
On January 21, 1909, we find that the Moon was in
conjunction with the Sun, and this was a new Moon in
the sign of Aquarius, in square aspect to the radical
Saturn, which is in the fourth house in Scorpio. This
lunation marked the day when the woman first
contracted the cold which culminated in pneumonia.
Saturn at birth is square to the radical Sun, and the
lunation naturally strengthened this affliction. This of
itself would not have affected the lungs, but we find the
progressed Sun in conjunction with the radical Venus in
the 8th house and in the watery sign of Pisces. Venus is
the most adversely situated planet in the horoscope; it is
in its exaltation in Pisces, but is afflicted by a square of
Jupiter and Uranus at birth. The radical Jupiter is
receiving assistance from the sextile of the Moon, and
Uranus has a trine from Saturn, which will ameliorate
the evil of these two planets, but Venus is afflicted from
both sides and without a single good aspect to offset the
evil. We also find that Venus had progressed to 7°50’ of
Taurus in the tenth house and had reached a square of the
radical Sun. The double affliction of the Sun, the effect
of which is of a hot and inflammatory nature, was in this 74 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS case responsible for the inflammation which took place
in the capillaries of the lungs.
But the question may be asked, why should this
inflammation take place in the lungs? Why not in the
throat or the feet where the afflicting planets are found?
Mars, which is another hot and inflammatory planet had
progressed to 21-00 degrees of Gemini and was then
squaring the radical Venus and progressed Sun. Mars,
therefore, was the focusing point of the disease.
We have previously stated that the Moon is the time
marker of a disease and also marks the crisis. We
therefore go to the beginning when the cold was
contracted and watch when the Moon came to a square
to the place of the lunation, which was at midnight of
Jan. 27, 1909, seven days later. Medical science counts
its critical days by 7, 14, and 21. The Moon has
particular influence over man, and marks the time when
recovery is apt to take place.
Let us follow the transiting Moon on her journey and
see her influence. On the 25th she reached the
conjunction of the radical Venus and progressed Sun,
also the opposition to the progressed Moon, which was
in 27°28’ of Virgo. This did not bring any great change,
but on the night of the 27th and the early morning of the
28th when the transiting Moon reached the square of the
preceding lunation, a conjunction with the Midheaven,
the Dragon's Tail, and the progressed Venus, also an
opposition to the radical Saturn, death was very close. At
1 A.M. of the 28th the woman passed out of the body. A LESSON IN DIRECTING 75 She was able to see herself lying on the bed, and was
fully conscious that death was near when the cries of the
nurse who shook her brought her back to life.
The length of an illness may be known by the signs
in which the planets which caused the illness are found.
If in fixed signs, the recovery is slow; in cardinal signs,
the illness is very severe but quickly over. In all cases it
is well to look to the radical aspects of Mars and the Sun.
If these planets are well situated and aspected as in the
case of this woman (Mars trine to the Sun), and if fixed
signs are on the angles, it is an indication that the patient
will win out, where many under similar afflictions would
go to the grave. CHAPTER XII
THE EARS
NO. 1A—EARS AND NERVES
Female, born June 1, 1884, 11: 45 A.M.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate;
I am the captain of my soul. W ELL may Henley say that man is the captain
of his soul. When we look at this horoscope,
we read the message in the planets that this soul had
prepared a wide gate for itself and that the Path should
be smooth and full of sunshine, for we find twenty-four
good and but eight evil aspects. This from an astrologer's
point of view should bring good health and happiness.
We find the common and earthy sign of Virgo on the
Ascendant, with the Moon and Uranus in conjunction in
the first house, forming a sextile with Venus and a trine
with Mercury, which latter is the ruler of the Ascendant
and Midheaven; also a trine to the higher octave of
Mercury, the mystical Neptune. This will give a degree
of intellectuality. This woman should be attracted to the 76 THE EARS 77 study of dietetics and interested in humanitarian work,
for the humanitarian and advanced Uranus, which is so
prominent in the first house and in conjunction with the Moon, is ruler of the sixth house, which governs the
common people, the laboring classes.
The common and earthy sign of Virgo gives a
tendency to drift along the path of least resistance. The 78 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS people under this sign are not keen to battle with the tide
but prefer to drift and are prone to become victims of
their physical ailments. In the case of this woman we
find Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, posited in Leo
in the 12th house, that of self-undoing. When Mars is in
the fixed and fiery sign of Leo, its influence for good or
evil is much greater than elsewhere. We find in this case
that Mars is the chief afflicter, being square and parallel
to the life ruler, Mercury, and square to its higher octave,
Neptune. But why should this affliction be considered
important when there are so many good aspects to offset
it? People with Mars in Leo may be likened to a keg of
powder: they are apt to go off at any moment, especially
when Mercury and its higher octave, Neptune, are square
to Mars and in the fixed sign of Taurus. These aspects
give an ungovernable temper and indicate one who
would hold resentment.
We find Venus, the planet ruling the appetite, the
palate, and the pleasures of the table, in the 11th house of
friends, in the sign of Cancer, governing the stomach.
Venus is sextile to Mercury and Neptune, both of which
are placed in the home of Venus, the sign ruling the
throat, Taurus. Venus is also sextile to the Moon, the
ruler of Cancer, and to Uranus, the natural ruler of the
11th house. These aspects and positions indicate that this
woman was blessed (or shall we in this case term it
afflicted?) with many friends who invited her to many
dinners, and she was ever ready to respond, for with the
Moon and Uranus in conjunction in the first house she THE EARS 79 was naturally of a restless nature and ready to go
whenever an invitation arrived. A sextile between Venus
in Cancer and the Moon gives desire for rich pastries and
sweets, consequently her stomach was much abused by
excesses. Also her nervous system was shattered by fits
of anger. Thus the vagus or pneumogastric nerve was
weakened.
This cranial nerve, which has its origin in the fourth
ventricle, plays a prominent part in the functions of the
physical body. Its branches extend to the ear, throat,
heart, lungs, and liver, and it surrounds the esophagus—
the tube through which the food passes after it leaves the
mouth—with a network of little nerves. Its branches also
surround a large part of the stomach. An excess of food
which dilated and distended the stomach, brought about
by the impacts of the Moon and Uranus on the
Ascendant, and the temper of Mars square Mercury
undermined this poor woman's health so that she became
a chronic invalid.
The Sun is in a common sign near the Midheaven
and afflicted by a conjunction with Saturn in the
Mercurial sign of Gemini. Mercury, the life ruler, has
rule over the hearing. We naturally look to the place
occupied by the strongest planet for the affliction. This
woman was afflicted with deafness in both ears, for one
branch of the vagus nerve rules the auricle of the ear. She
also suffered from a constant pain under her right
shoulder blade, indicating liver trouble, and she was
abnormally nervous. 80 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Here we may see how man may be his own
executioner, as indicated in this horoscope. The ruler of
the house of death, the eighth house, is afflicted in the
house of self-undoing, the twelfth. The only remedy for a
patient of this type is to eliminate all sweets and pastries,
cut down the supply of food to one-half, and learn to be
still, to relax. NO. 1B—THE EARS T HIS woman was born on June 22, 1881, at noon.
We find the Venusian sign of Libra on the
Ascendant and the Sun on the cusp of the Midheaven.
This is the most powerfully situated planet and therefore
the life ruler. The Sun is sextile to Mars. In The Message
of the Stars, page 164, we are told that a good aspect
between these two fiery planets strengthens the
constitution and makes the person able to perform hard
tasks and produces a superabundance of vital energy. As
the Sun is accidentally dignified by being placed in the
10th house and on the cusp of the Midheaven, the native
should have an abundance of will and energy to
overcome almost any disease. This we will touch upon
later.
We find here a very strange combination of planets,
a blending of benefics and malefics, all clustered in the THE EARS 81 8th house and in the fixed sign of Taurus, ruling the
region of the throat and neck.
We find Mars in Taurus, the sign of Venus, where he
is in his detriment, in conjunction with Saturn; this
strengthens the malefic tendencies of Mars. Some may question the conjunction of Mars 0°31’ and Saturn Mercúrio °13’
as we have heretofore given six degrees as the orb of the 82 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS minor planets, but there are exceptions to this rule.
Where we find a cluster of planets placed in a sign in
which their evil tendencies are strong, especially when in
a fixed and also a bestial sign, then the orbs of those
planets are greater, their influence is stronger. Now, with
Saturn's evil enhanced by the martial rays, Saturn will
have a strong influence for evil when he is placed within
orb of a conjunction with the Moon and Neptune.
We look for the physical trouble from the above four
planets. These placed in Taurus, the sign ruling the neck,
also the glands, nerves, and arteries within this region of
the body which Saturn is afflicting, indicate atrophy or
obstruction. Saturn's influence on Neptune and the Moon
would cause a contraction of the nerves. We find Jupiter
and Venus also in conjunction with the Moon and
Neptune and therefore indirectly influenced by the orb of
the afflicting Saturn. So we may conclude that this entire
group of six planets situated in the fixed sign of Taurus
and in the 8th house is under affliction.
Jupiter rules the arterial blood, and Venus the venous
blood. Neptune and the Moon on account of the
conjunction with Saturn may be termed malefic and will
restrict the circulation in the carotid artery and interfere
with the various tubes that carry air and fluid to the ear,
for the Moon also rules the white fluids or body oil. As a
result of the restriction of the various fluids, the semicircular canals of the inner ear are lacking in the liquid
known as endolymph. This liquid acts upon the nerves
that run to the three canals as the acid acts upon the THE EARS 83 copper plates in an electric battery. Where this
endolymph is lacking, the equilibrium of the body is
disturbed, and, as in the case of this young woman,
people so afflicted cannot walk without pitching
forward.
With the obstructed circulation of both arterial and
venous blood, she has also suffered with spasmodic
torticollis, the twisting of the cervical muscles. The
square of Mercury to Mars would give this nervous
contraction.
The trouble developed in the fall of 1914 when the
progressed Moon had reached a conjunction with the
radical Mercury, the transiting Uranus was in 8 degrees
of Aquarius making a square to Saturn, and the transiting
Saturn was in conjunction with the radical Sun in the
Midheaven. These transits excited the affliction of the
progressed Moon, and naturally the nervous system was
disturbed.
It has been said in our astrological diagnosis in the
past that the conjunction of Saturn and Neptune in
Scorpio or Taurus may cause malformation of the
generative organs, and in The Message of the Stars a
case was given proving this. The affliction of planets
often works in squares and oppositions. In this case all
the planets are in Taurus, which rules the larynx and
throat and is the sign opposite to Scorpio, ruling the
generative organs. Here we find the cause of a
disturbance which to some extent helped to bring about
the physical trouble. There was an abnormal and 84 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS unnatural sex desire which, not finding expression,
excited the flow of blood to the throat, and this being
obstructed caused a disturbance.
Now regarding the sextile of the Sun and Mars and
the trine of Uranus to the various afflicted planets in
Taurus, were it not for these good aspects this young
lady would not have grown to womanhood, for great
trouble would have arisen during puberty. But the lifegiving Sun, so powerfully situated in the Midheaven,
sextile to Mars, and also within orb of a sextile to Saturn,
saved her much trouble during this period.
If she could come under the care of an experienced
osteopathic physician who understands proper
manipulations, this together with a careful diet would
enable her to overcome her physical afflictions. THE EARS 85 NO. 1C—EARS, ABSCESSES IN FRONTAL BONE
Female, born December 30th, 1864, at Mercúrio :30 Plutão .M. I N this horoscope we will continue with afflictions
found in cardinal signs. While they may be in
different signs of the cardinal group, yet the effect is
similar in all.
In this lesson we have the horoscope of a woman
with Virgo on the Ascendant and common signs on the
angles. Two prominent planets, Uranus and Mars, are in
or near the 10th house. While they are retrograde and not
in conjunction, still they are parallel to each other and
parallel to the Sun. Mars being in conjunction with the
Midheaven, sextile to Neptune, and trine to the Moon,
gives great enthusiasm. Whatever this woman attempts
to do is done under impulse and with great force. With
Mars and Uranus so prominent and the Sun in Capricorn
she feels that she must rule at any cost. Should she be
denied this privilege, she would become very resentful
and revengeful.
With Saturn in its sign of exaltation, Libra, square to
Mercury in the Saturnian sign of Capricorn, we meet the
vicious circle of the cardinal signs. The Sun in
Capricorn, afflicted by a square of Neptune, both in
cardinal signs, together with the parallel of the nervous
and excitable Uranus to the hot and inflammable Mars
has caused a succession of abscesses in the frontal bone,
resulting in partial deafness in both ears. Here we find 86 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the previously mentioned circle culminating in the ears.
The writer has found numerous cases of partial deafness
resulting from an afflicted Mercury in Capricorn, conjunction, square,
or opposition Saturn, especially when Saturn was in a
cardinal sign.
It is not necessary, however, that these afflicted
planets should cause deafness. The planets impel, they THE EARS 87 excite. But wisdom is ever a friend which saves; man has
but to learn to know himself. If he would be as zealous in
understanding the functions of his own physical body as
he is those of his radio or automobile, then when
planetary afflictions became known to him and the
symptoms appeared in the physical body, he would at
once set to work to conquer them, just as he would go
about repairing the mechanism of his machine, oiling it,
and cleaning it. For instance, if congestion were felt in
the neck or ears, there would most likely be some
discomfort experienced before any damage was done.
Then a slight manipulation should be made about the
ears and the frontal bone, up and down the jugular vein,
the back of the neck, and wherever the fingers can find
sore spots on and about the cranium. Frequently a towel
wrung out of hot water will relax the restricted nerve
centers in head and neck and regulate the blood flow to
and from the brain. This will keep the congestion down,
and all serious trouble may be avoided. CHAPTER XIII
THE EYES
NO. 2A—EYE TROUBLE
Male, born March 21, 1847, between 1:00 and 2:00
A.M. W E usually judge the appearance of the native
by the ruler of the Ascendant and the planets
on or near the Ascendant, also by the positions of the
Sun and Moon and their aspects. In this case we find
there are two rulers, Capricorn being intercepted in the
1st house. One of the rulers, the planet Jupiter, is in its
detriment in the sign of Gemini, making a square aspect
to the co-ruler Saturn, showing that these two planets are
very active in affecting the personal appearance and also
the personality. Saturn has a tendency to darken the eyes
and hair and to make the body and the features small.
This man has the physical appearance of a Capricornian,
is thin-featured and small of body, and very nervous and
restless. It is always necessary to study the temperament
of the patient in order to know how to deal with him, as
it often gives a clue to the cause of disease and also helps
to guide us in giving advice. 88 THE EYES 89 We find that the Sun, Uranus, Mercury, and Venus
are all in the martial and energetic sign of Aries, with the
Sun making a sextile to Jupiter and Mars. The lastnamed planet is intercepted in the 1st house in the saturnine sign
of Capricorn and is making a square to Venus and a trine
to the Moon. Mars thus placed in the first house gives a
very materialistic state of mind. This man would 90 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS sacrifice his health in the pursuance of success in
worldly matters. He craves riches, and worries and
becomes very restless when material matters do not
prosper. This would in time, if continued, undermine his
health and cause him to suffer from nervous disease.
Neptune in the sign of Aquarius in square aspect to
the Moon in the worrisome and pessimistic sign of
Taurus in the 5th house, the house of investments,
indicates that he expends much energy in speculation. It
is plainly indicated that he has a tendency to become
entangled with large corporations. He wrote to
Headquarters several times endeavoring to get us to
advise him regarding his speculations, but was told
repeatedly that this was against our teachings. During the
war he invested his all in a large corporation which was
building a submarine boat in which it hoped to interest
the government; but the corporation did not succeed in
this, and in consequence he lost heavily. We find that
Saturn in the 2nd house in the watery sign of Pisces,
square to Jupiter in Gemini; also the watery planet
Neptune is in the last degree of Aquarius in the 2nd
house, square to the watery Moon in the 5th house and
the second sign, Taurus—all indicating speculation and
loss.
Worry over financial loss aggravated the eye trouble
from which he had suffered for a number of years. He
has been an incessant reader and has put a heavy strain
on his eyes. The mental disturbance over his financial
loss weakened the nervous system, causing him to lose THE EYES 91 the sight of one eye. We find the Moon in 29 degrees of
Taurus conjunction the Pleiades and square to Neptune;
Jupiter is in 10 degrees of Gemini in the 6th house, that
of sickness, in opposition to the fixed star Antares, which
is situated in 8 degrees of Sagittarius; also Jupiter is
making a square to the obstructing Saturn—all indicating
eye trouble.
We find Mars square to Venus and trine to the Moon
in Taurus. This man has in the past been fond of the
“fleshpots of Egypt,” and has gone to excess in drink and
good things to eat. The result is constipation and internal
hemorrhoids. We note that with Jupiter square to Saturn
he has also suffered from obstructed arterial circulation.
Due to the amount of food consumed in the past the poor
body has been unable to bear the strain. At present he is
fearing the loss of the second eye, which if he is not
more careful in his diet and mode of living may be the
case.
This man would be a very hard patient to heal, as
Mars in Capricorn near the Ascendant is a most stubborn
influence; he will not take advice from anyone. It would
take great persuasion and diplomacy to get him to follow
the advice of the healer. 92 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 2B—BX: THE EYES T HE Rosicrucian method of healing is not only
one of faith, but it is faith joined with common
sense. We recognize disease, we acknowledge that it is
caused by breaking the laws of nature. Sometimes there
is lack of will. The horoscopes that we will herewith
diagnose will show how one can overcome where
another will succumb to almost the same astrological
conditions.
NO 2B
Female, born December 1, 1862.
Application for healing was made by this woman
during the winter of 1918, to assist her during an
operation for the removal of cataracts on both eyes. She
had been under the care of the doctor for a number of
months. He concluded that the cataracts had reached a
stage where they could be removed with safety, but the
woman felt that she desired the assistance of our
Invisible Helpers during this trying period. She had
previously heard of the wonderful success of our healers
from friends who had been benefited.
There were a number of good aspects in the
horoscope, which always make for safety, especially
Mars trine the Sun, which gives great recuperative
power. In looking for the afflictions we find Mercury THE EYES 93 opposition to the Pleiades in Taurus, and the Sun and
Venus conjoined to Antares. The Pleiades and Antares
are fixed stars which have direct influence over the
eyesight; especially is this true when they are afflicting
the Sun and Mercury. Much of this woman's trouble is due to the
afflictions which we find in the cardinal signs, Aries and
Libra, the latter of which has rule over the kidneys.
Jupiter is in Libra along with the restricting Saturn, 94 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS which is strong in its exaltation sign. Saturn is in
opposition to Neptune in Aries, while Mars is also strong
in Aries, being conjoined the Moon. These are danger
signals, showing that through wrong living (Moon
conjoined Mars stimulates the appetite) she has
undermined her health by wrong choice of foods and by
eating to excess. These practices have filled the kidneys
with poisons, and when the kidneys suffer the eyes go
wrong, for the eyesight is frequently impaired through
the kidneys. However, cataracts are usually due to an
excess of sweets, creams, and very rich foods, and the
afflictions in Libra are prone to send these impurities to
the eyes. But since Mars is in good aspect to the Sun and
Venus, and the Sun and Venus are in conjunction, this
woman has overcome the obstacles and been cured,
passing successfully through the operation for removal
of cataracts.
NO. 2BX
Female, born April Mercúrio , 1851.
The chart for this case is the same as 11B, page 279.
We here give the outcome of this case in 1919, and
earlier stage of which in 1915 is described in No. 11B.
This is the case of a woman afflicted similarly to the
one in No. 2B, but the reverse condition is found as
regards the aspects of the planets. Nothing but adverse THE EYES 95 aspects exist, with the exception of one, Mars trine to the
Moon. We find the Sun, the life giver, in the sign Aries,
restricted by a conjunction of Saturn and in opposition to
Jupiter, ruling the arterial blood, placed in the sign Libra,
ruling the kidneys. These three planets are also square to
the Moon in Cancer, the stomach. Here we find the
kidneys (the janitor), the stomach, (the cook), and the
head of the home, Aries, all afflicted, careless, and not
doing their work. How can a home be kept clean and fit
to live in if all the workers are on a strike? The dust will
accumulate, and naturally the tenant will be very
uncomfortable. We find the stove full of ashes; it will not
burn, and the smoke is escaping through the doors and
windows instead of through the chimney.
In this horoscope we find the same indications as in
No. 2B. The kidneys have not been eliminating properly,
and an abundance of food has been consumed which has
not been properly digested. Naturally the body has
become overcharged with poisons, which must find an
outlet. We again find that the weakest place is the head
and eyes. When this woman called upon us she had been
operated on by a doctor who claimed that it was
necessary to remove both eyeballs as they had become
diseased. The operation had already been performed
upon one of them, which affected the sight of the other.
The result was that our healing was not successful. We
were able, however, to help the patient greatly in the
matter of her stomach trouble, it having seemed almost
impossible for her to digest her food. But in her 96 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS horoscope we find little encouragement. Mars evidently
did not give the assistance necessary. Mercury, the Sun
and Moon are all afflicted. The native had not the
strength of will or mentality to assist nature in a cure of
her blindness, as we find Mercury square the Moon and
conjunction Saturn.
In order to help such patients it is necessary first to
remove the cause of the disease. We must advise them to
live so that the kidneys will be purified. An entire change
of diet is necessary; tea, coffee, meat, and all starchy
foods must be eliminated. Nine patients out of ten will
respond to healing very quickly as soon as you give them
a sane and rational diet. Teach them how to live, and the
work of the Invisible Helpers will be greatly reinforced. THE EYES 97 NO. 2C—THE EYES
Female, born June 13, 1873, 11:55 Plutão .M. F IRST we judge the mind, by the aspects and
position of Mercury and the Moon. We find that
Mercury is in conjunction with the Sun, but not so close
as to be combust; therefore he is in a very good position.
We also see that he is sextile to Jupiter and Neptune and
trine to Mars. This gives the mind considerable energy
and brightness and creates an optimistic nature. On the
other hand we find the Moon in conjunction with the
planet of obstruction, Saturn, and square to Venus, which
is a testimony in the opposite direction. Saturn is square
to Neptune and Uranus is square to Mars. Thus all four
malefics are afflicting one another, and there can never
be any great cheerfulness where this is the case, unless
the person can learn through philosophy or religion to
seek a peace that is above earthly understanding. At the
same time it must be understood that all the good aspects
in the present case will help to give the native occasional
periods of optimism and joy, which will break the
periods of gloom and despondency.
We find that there are common signs on the angles,
which is a testimony of a flexible character, difficult to
rouse from sickness or trouble into which the native may
fall. The Moon in conjunction with Saturn in Aquarius,
the sign which governs the ankles and lower parts of the
limbs, is evidence of a poor circulation; and Uranus in 98 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Leo, the sign of the heart, in opposition to the Moon and
Saturn, shows that there is a fluttering of that organ. This
condition is much aggravated by the aforementioned
square of the four malefics. Saturn rules the pneumogastric nerve. If you count
four degrees forward from the position of Neptune to
make the exact square with Saturn, you will find that the
point thus reached falls in Taurus, which governs the THE EYES 99 lower part of the head and the neck. This shows that
there is pressure upon the pneumogastric nerve where it
leaves the head. If this could be relieved by an
osteopathic treatment, much good could be done for this
person. On the other hand, the square of Saturn to Mars
in the last degrees of Libra (which works also upon the
first degrees of Scorpio), shows that there is trouble with
the elimination of the urine, a restriction on account of
scalding urine and bleeding piles, for Mars afflicted
always causes heat and eruption.
But the worst affliction in this person's life arises
from the fact that Uranus is in the nebulous spot of the
zodiac called Ascelli, which is centered in Leo 6. Uranus
being there and in opposition to Saturn and the Moon
causes blindness, which sad to say cannot be cured by
any physical means, for the afflictions which come from
the fixed signs usually indicate a destiny which we have
made for ourselves in past lives and which is now “ripe.”
All that we can do for this person is to endeavor to make
her as cheerful as possible under that affliction.
With respect to the poor circulation and the faulty
elimination of waste products, a great deal can be done
by osteopathic treatments and the proper kind of food.
She should avoid all condiments and stimulating foods
which heat the urine, and she should be taught to walk
for exercise so as to strengthen the circulation in the
body.
There are many people who have been afflicted with
blindness yet who have made their mark in the world. 100 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS “What man has done, man can do.” By constantly
stimulating her to effort she may be roused from the
lethargy indicated by the common signs on the angles so
that she will cease to feel her condition as she does at the
present time. NO. 2D—EYE TROUBLE Male, born February 11, 1918, 3:45 A.M.
If the poor child whose horoscope we are about to
diagnose had lived, he might well have said, “I could
have been the master of my fate, but instead I have
become a slave.” Freedom of will depends upon the
limitations which the soul has placed for itself in its
former lives. It may have placed obstacles in its way by
wrong use of knowledge or by breaking the laws of
nature in some way. Man was made in the likeness of
God and God gave him dominion over the lower
kingdoms. Therefore he has no one to interfere with his
freedom of will; he is absolute master of his destiny.
Now, if this is so, why do we find so many who are
born with misshapen and deformed bodies or whose
lives have been so unfortunate? Sometimes through THE EYES 101 accidents as wee babes they are made to suffer during the
rest of their earth life. A cause set going in one life has
its effect in another embodiment. If it were not so, if the law of cause and effect were not established beyond a
doubt, would not God, whom we know is an all-loving
Father, be very cruel and unjust? Could we love and
worship such a tyrant? But He has made man a little
lower than the angels and has offered him a crown of 102 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS glory. This crown is not given for the asking, however;
man must earn it by a life of purity and unselfishness.
Now let us see what fate we may find in this babe's
horoscope:
We find Sagittarius rising, with Venus, Moon, Sun,
and Uranus all in conjunction in the advanced sign of
Aquarius, intercepted in the 2nd house, sextile to the
Ascendant. Also the Dragon's Head, which is of a
Jupiterian nature, is in conjunction with the Ascendant.
This would have given the little fellow a most beautiful
and charming personality. With Mars near the
Midheaven, trine to Mercury, which is in the mental sign
of Aquarius, he was very bright mentally.
At eleven months of age he could stand alone. On
July 12, 1919, at the age of 17 months, he fell from a
balcony, but no serious symptoms developed. At that
time we find the transiting Moon and Mars square to the
radical Mars in the Midheaven; this is a very strong
indication of accident. On July 14th and 15th the boy
began to get drowsy, and could not keep food in his
stomach, for on that day the transiting Moon was in
Aquarius, making an opposition to Saturn and Neptune
in the eighth house in Leo. On the morning of the 16th
he was taken with convulsions, the transiting Moon
having just passed a conjunction with Venus, Moon,
Sun, and Uranus. Uranus when afflicted causes
convulsions. At the third convulsion the child lost his
eyesight, for the transiting Mercury had reached an
opposition to the planets in Aquarius (especially the THE EYES 103 lights, the Sun and the Moon), which brought on total
blindness, as indicated in the radical chart by Neptune in
conjunction with fixed stars, the Ascelli, and also in
conjunction with Saturn. On the fifth day of his illness he
became unconscious, lost his hearing and the control of
his tongue, and the head was drawn back over the spine.
A number of the most noted doctors were consulted, but
none could diagnose the case. They operated on the head
and spine, however, and the operations failed.
Now, from the astrological diagnosis what do we
find? Neptune rules the spinal canal, that channel of
spiritual fire from which all life emanates. Saturn, the
planet of obstruction, the chastener, is found in
conjunction with this occult planet, which also has rule
over the pineal gland through which the spiritual
faculties first become awakened. Abuse of the spiritual
powers in former lives brings about physical infirmities.
From birth this boy's spine was affected, the spinal fluid
obstructed, and total blindness unavoidable. It is a
known fact to astrologers that a child born at the new or
the full of the Moon, if not supported strongly by
benefics, rarely lives. This child was born when the Sun
and Moon were in exact conjunction with the benefic
Venus, and Mars, the planet of energy, was elevated near
the cusp of the 10th house, trine to Jupiter and Mercury.
These benefic aspects made it possible for this babe to
live for a short time. We have not the exact date of the
child's death. The last letter we received from the parents
stated that he was very low on November 6th, and was 104 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS not expected to live. We find on November 14th, 1919,
the transiting Sun making a square to the cluster of
planets in Aquarius, and the transiting Moon in
conjunction with the afflicting planets in Leo and
making an opposition to the planets in Aquarius. It
would be almost impossible for the babe to pass these
afflictions, and death, no doubt, occurred at that time. THE EYES W E will here give a lesson on the effect of
Saturn, the obstructor, when in the last
decanate of Aquarius. The writer has observed that many
cases of eye trouble may be traced to Saturn when he is
posited between the 24th and the 30th degrees of
Aquarius, and especially does this affect the sight of the
left eye.
NO. 2E.
Female, born August 19, 1905.
We will use a flat figure as the hour of birth is
missing. We find the Sun in its own sign of Leo. Saturn
is retrograde in its own sign, Aquarius, and Mars is in
Scorpio, the sign in which it is able to exercise its full
strength. These three powerful planets are all in fixed THE EYES 105 signs and in opposition or square to one another. Here
we find a debt of ripe destiny facing this soul which it
was impossible to avoid. At the age of twelve this girl
was almost entirely blind. Now let us see if we cannot read the message of the
stars and see why this dreadful affliction should come
upon one so young. What is the debt that she is called 106 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS upon to pay? Neptune, the planet which rules spiritual
sight, is exalted in the watery sign of Cancer. This occult
planet is in opposition to Uranus, which is retrograde and
in the saturnine sign of Capricorn. Uranus stands for
clairvoyance and the unseen. Capricorn is the natural
10th house sign of authority, that of one who rules. The
Sun, Saturn, and Mars, all at home and in fixed and
dominant signs and Mars parallel to both Neptune and
Uranus indicate that this poor soul in a previous life, and
in a cruel and dominant manner while occupying a male
body, used his occult powers to enslave the opposite sex,
thereby causing many tears to be shed. It is said, “The
mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding
small.” The Lords of Destiny have brought this Ego, who
caused so many tears to flow in a past life, into the weak
body of this little girl, whose mother, fearing childbirth,
shed many tears while carrying her. The result was a
tender, sensitive body with impaired eyesight. THE EYES 107 NO. 2F
Female, born January 31, 1876, 8:00 Plutão .M. H ERE we have Saturn in the 26th degree of
Aquarius in conjunction with Mercury and in
the 6th house, the house ruling sickness. The Moon is
parallel to and in conjunction with Mars in the sign of 108 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Aries. This indicates emotion and impulse. It shows one
who does not reason but jumps into things thoughtlessly
and with fear. Especially is fear indicated when in
addition the sign of Virgo is rising. Sometimes in such
cases the resulting acts of impulse rebound upon the
native, causing great suffering, as in the case of this
woman. When she began to suffer with eyestrain she
permitted the doctors to operate on her eyes on two
different occasions. The first time they removed the right
eyeball, and the second time the operation destroyed the
sight of the left eye. From planetary indications, with the
proper care and diet her eyesight might have been saved,
but unfortunately she did not hear of the Invisible
Helpers until too late.
We see that in the case of horoscope No. 2E, the
native was in the hands of fate, and she had to pass
through the greater part of this life in darkness, while in
the second figure fear and excessive emotion precipitated
total blindness. THE EYES 109 NO. 2G—THE EYES
Female, born July 27, 1856, at Mercúrio :00 A.M. T HIS woman has the feminine, earthy, and
common sign of Virgo on the Ascendant. We
are taught in the Cosmo-Conception that the Law of
Consequence works in harmony with the planets, and
that the spirit is born into the physical world at that
opportune time when these may operate in harmony with
each other. The birth of the Ego is so timed by the Lords
of Destiny that the horoscope, which is the clock of
destiny, registers the kind of debts which the Ego has
incurred in its previous lives and the time when these
debts come to fruition, when the harvest from the seeds
which have been sown must be garnered.
However, the law of destiny is not a blind law, for it
may be modified to a certain degree in proportion to the
strength of the will of the Ego. When fixed or cardinal
signs are on the angles and the afflictions are from
common signs, then the Ego is often able to modify the
effect of planetary afflictions; but when, as for instance
in the horoscope under consideration, we find a common
sign on the Ascendant and the afflictions come from
fixed signs, then it is very probable that the forces
involved in the debt of destiny are too powerful for the
Ego and the Law must take its course.
In this horoscope we find the Sun strongly placed in
its own sign, Leo, which is a fixed sign, in conjunction 110 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS with Venus, square to the inflammatory Mars, and
parallel to Uranus. The fiery planet, the Sun, is also in
conjunction with the Ascelli, a fixed star which is in
5°41’ of Leo and has influence over the eyes. We find
Uranus in 24°36’ Taurus, a fixed sign, in conjunction with the
Pleiades, a group of fixed stars which are in 28°41’ of
Taurus, also having an afflicting influence upon the eyes. THE EYES 111 We find the Moon prominently situated near the
Midheaven in 12°29’ of Gemini and in opposition to
another fixed star, Antares, which is in 8 degrees and 27
minutes of Sagittarius.
Here we may read from the clock of destiny that
blindness was likely to be the fate of this woman. With
the feminine, earthy, and common sign of Virgo on the
Ascendant and the afflictions from fixed signs, what
could be expected but that the will of this soul would not
be strong enough to overcome. Total blindness was the
result.
But what did she do to precipitate this? We find
Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in the 10th house in the
sign of its fall, Cancer, and square to Jupiter. Saturn is
most evil in this watery sign, the sign of the stomach,
where he can undermine health by denying the stomach
the fluids which are so necessary for digestion. In Cancer
Saturn also perverts the appetite. People with Saturn
afflicted in Cancer have strange likes and dislikes
regarding food and are most stubborn about it. Even if
they know that too many chocolate creams and sodas and
too much pie, cake, etc., will undermine their health,
they will have them. People with this affliction
frequently suffer from auto-intoxication. The poison
which is then generated by the stomach is mixed with the
blood stream, and this very frequently precipitates
blindness.
We find in this horoscope a well-aspected Mercury,
which is sextile to Uranus and the Ascendant and trine to 112 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Neptune, indicating that the native had a keen desire for
knowledge, especially along occult lines, and did not
save her eyes, but very likely read with poor light late at
night, perhaps reading in bed, which is a most dangerous
habit and which has caused many to lose their eyesight.
But every cloud has its silver lining, and although this
poor woman has been totally blind for some years, yet
she has developed the sixth sense. With Neptune sextile
Uranus and trine Mercury, she has a wonderful
development of the spiritual faculties, making it possible
for her to leave her body at will and she claims to be able
to travel to far-off planets.
Had these afflicting planets and the Ascendant been
reversed, with a fixed sign rising and the afflictions from
common signs, even though Saturn had been in Cancer,
the will would have been strong enough to have saved at
least a degree of this woman's eyesight.

With the self-same winds that blow.
'Tis the set of the sail and not the gale
Which determines the way they go. THE EYES 113 NO. 2H—THE EYES.
Female, born June 28th, 1868. T HIS horoscope is minus the hour of birth;
therefore we are using a plain figure with the
planets copied from the Ephemeris for noon, Greenwich
Mean Time. But from all indications we believe that this
woman has the last part of Cancer on the Ascendant.
The Sun is in conjunction with Uranus, square to
Jupiter, Uranus being square to Neptune, while Jupiter is
in conjunction with Neptune in Aries. If we take the
rising sign to be Cancer, this would bring the Moon back
so that it would be within orb of an opposition to Jupiter
and Neptune and square to Uranus. We have here a
configuration of planets which indicates that excesses
and emotions have ruled this woman to a very great
extent, especially as we find the planet of desires, the
hot-tempered Mars, in its fall in Taurus. Mars when in
Taurus has a tendency to express his evil side and is
prone to cause excesses in food and also in temper. Now,
with Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach, on the
Ascendant and with Uranus, the planet of impulse, in
conjunction with the Sun and square to Jupiter and
Neptune, we have a woman who has very little selfcontrol. Excesses of all kinds have filled her body with
toxic matter. The blood vessels have become clogged
and hardened. When a woman at the age of fifty-five
who has had to work hard to support herself and family 114 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS gives way to anger, and when as a result the blood
bounds through the hardened arteries, bringing an
unusual rush of it to the head, we may expect trouble.
Let us see where this may be found: Mars is in conjunction with the group of fixed stars,
called the Pleiades, which have an evil effect upon the
eyes. With Mars in 27°55’ of Taurus in conjunction with
fixed stars of a Mars-Moon nature, with the progressed
Sun within orb of a square to Mars, and with the
progressed Saturn retrograded back to the opposition of THE EYES 115 Mars, there is a tendency for the temper to be
aggravated, bringing trouble upon parts of the body
which Mars affects—in this case the eyes. Saturn has a
hardening, ossifying, restricting influence upon the part
of the body corresponding to his position in the
horoscope. We find this planet in 0 degrees and 0
minutes of Sagittarius in opposition to Mars radical.
With these afflictions we may expect some trouble with
the eyes.
In the early part of July, 1923, this woman
developed what doctors called retinitis of the right eye,
which is an inflammation of the retina. This caused a
rupture of one of the blood vessels accompanied by
severe pains in the neck and shoulders.
We would not, however, attribute all the damage to
temper and hardened arteries, for the foundation of the
trouble had been laid by eyestrain. This woman was
employed during the day as a chiropodist, and at night
she spent long hours in reading occultism and studying
astrology. She had the pernicious habit of reading with a
bright light close to the eyes while lying upon a couch or
bed, thereby causing a strain of the muscles of the eye.
With Neptune in opposition to the Moon and Uranus
square to both Neptune and the Moon, there has been a
desire to force development. Intensive gazing at bright
objects, such as crystals, etc., which is ignorantly taught
by some occult orders, has a most destructive effect upon
the eyes and has caused much eye trouble among occult
students. CHAPTER XIV
THE THROAT
NO. 3A—B: TONSILS—ADENOIDS
Male, born March 20, 1911, 3:10 Plutão .M. F IGURE No. 3A has Leo rising, with the ruler,
the Sun, in conjunction with and parallel to
Mercury in the 8th house, and in the 12th house sign of
Pisces. This position and aspect of the ruler would
deplete the vitality and create nervousness. The boy
would be easily disturbed and of a fretful nature. This
would interfere with the assimilation of food in the small
intestines, for the conjunction of Mercury and the Sun
would have an effect in the opposite sign of Virgo, the
intestines. But we find another affliction which will have
a much more evil effect upon the health. Mars, the planet
of dynamic energy, also hot and fiery by nature, is
posited in the airy and nervous sign of Aquarius and in
the 6th house, ruling sickness. Mars afflicted in this
saturnine sign shows an evil side. We find him square to
the obstructive Saturn in the 9th house and in the sign of
Taurus, ruling the throat and the tonsils. Wherever we
find Saturn, especially when afflicted, we may expect
restriction, crystallization, and lack of fluids, and with a 116 THE THROAT 117 square aspect to Mars, the planet causing fevers and
inflammation, what can we expect but a disturbed condition of the throat, a swelling of the tonsils. The
affliction coming from fixed signs, and Mars being in the
6th house of sickness, the trouble will be somewhat
difficult to overcome, for this physical weakness was
brought over from a former life in which the soul had
broken the laws of nature. A case of this kind is often the 118 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS result of abuses of the most sacred function of the body,
that of the generative organs. The results of abortions, or
abuses of like nature, are often brought back into the
next embodiment producing weakened organs.
This boy could be helped greatly by manipulation
and massage to keep the circulation normal. The Piscean
Sun, conjunction Mercury, requires a quiet and
harmonious environment which we fear he will not have.
Jupiter in Scorpio supplies good food and plenty of it
which, however, he should not indulge in to excess. A
simple vegetarian diet will be most necessary for him.
Saturn in Taurus would indicate that one of the parents
will be apt to interfere with his freedom too much. A Leo
can be ruined by the “don'ts” of a saturnine parent, and
the boy would suffer in health as a result of this
restriction by one parent and overindulgence of the other. THE THROAT 119 NO. 3B
Female, born May 22, 1915, 3:22 A.M.
Horoscope No. 3B is that of a little girl who suffered
from the same illness as in the case of 3A, viz., the
swelling of tonsils, adenoids, etc., but with very different
astrological afflictions. This shows how invaluable the
study of astrology would be to the physician in his
diagnosis and that it is absolutely dangerous to treat each
case alike. What will heal one might be dangerous to
another.
Here we have another fixed sign on the Ascendant,
Taurus, ruling the throat, with its ruler, Venus, near the
cusp of the 1st house and sextile to Saturn, but square to
Neptune and in conjunction with Mars. The symptoms
would be very similar to those of 3A, but the trouble is
from a different source.
We find Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in the sign
of Cancer, the stomach. Although this planet is not
afflicted, yet wherever he is placed, or whatever organ he
rules over, there we may find a lack of fluids. Saturn
“dries up” and when he is in Cancer the appetite is
abnormal and digestive fluid is lacking. He craves the
things that are detrimental and refuses those which the
body needs, and is very apt to gourmandize when the
palate is tickled with pie, cake, candy, etc. The result is
that the body becomes clogged like a stream dammed up:
the material must find an outlet somewhere. In this case This compilation © Phoenix E-Books UK 120 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Mars, the planet of energy, is in conjunction with Venus,
the planet ruling the venous blood. This indicates the
section of the body that will be affected. The blood
becomes impure, causing swelling and inflammation in the throat. To manipulate this afflicted region would
cause more inflammation. The remedy here would be to
discontinue all food for a day or two and give the girl
only pineapple juice, putting the feet in hot water with THE THROAT 121 cold cloths on head and throat, in order to draw the
surplus blood to the lower extremities. This would give
instant relief.
Can we wonder, after comparing two horoscopes of
this kind, why the medical man often fails in his
treatment and feels that the only cure is the removal of
the inflamed parts? If he could read the stellar script, he
would make few failures and would then not be so apt to
ruin the life of the child by an operation. He little
realizes that a removal of the tonsils or an operation
upon the throat interferes with the function of the
generative organs. A child who has been operated upon
will suffer as a result when it reaches puberty. Painful
menstruation and trouble in childbirth are likely to affect
the life of the woman who has been thus operated upon
in childhood. Inflammation of the prostate gland in the
man, and various other physical weaknesses are often the
result of an operation upon the throat. 122 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 3C—THROAT AND TONSILS
Male, born July 11th, 1882, 11:15 A.M. H ERE is given the horoscope of a man with the
cardinal sign of Libra on the Ascendant, and
the ruler, Venus, in the fixed sign of Leo in the 11th
house, square and parallel to both the malefics, Saturn
and Neptune. The last two planets we find in the fixed
sign of Taurus and in the 8th house. This at the start is a
very serious affliction, indicating that this man came into
life facing a heavy debt of destiny.
Now let us see if we can find the cause of the
condition and why this soul has been restricted even
from birth. Leo and Taurus are both fixed signs, stubborn
and immovable, therefore they are also the signs which
bring chronic and incurable illnesses; and where the
afflictions come from two of the most subtle planets,
both slow in their motion, one may expect that the
disease is of a nature which the soul has attracted to itself
as a debt of destiny by the breaking of nature's laws in
past lives, and not so much on account of misdeeds in
this embodiment.
Planets often work in opposite signs. Afflictions as
in this horoscope, in the fixed sign of Taurus governing
the throat, may have been brought about by the abuse of
the generative function (Scorpio) in one life, causing a
weakness of the throat or larynx in the next life, or vice
versa. The unnecessary removal of the female organs in THE THROAT 123 one life may cause the Ego, who changes sex in each
life, to be born in a male body with the afflicted planets
in the opposite sign, Taurus, as in the case of this man
who was born with underdeveloped organs of voice and
throat. The above statement does not mean that all women
who have been operated on will have these afflictions.
Often through childbirth, or neglect of nurse or doctors,
the poor woman is forced to undergo an operation. These 124 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS are conditions for which she is not held accountable; but
should she on account of excesses or abortions have
weakened the organs of sex, which would make it
necessary for their removal, such sins will bring their
reaction in restrictions of some kind, usually of the
throat, which is under the rule of Taurus, the opposite
sign to Scorpio, which rules the generative organs. In
fact the larynx and brain were developed in primitive
man by the sacrifice of one half of the creative faculty.
Afflictions may not be active in the body in childhood,
and with a knowledge of the planets and a strict
adherence to the rules of right living, man may pass
through life with but little inconvenience; but whenever
the laws are broken, when abuses are allowed, then it is
that the afflicted parts give way, for as it is said, the
chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
We find the Sun in Cancer, which is the sign of the
stomach, sextile to Neptune in Taurus, the throat and
palate, also sextile to Uranus which is the ruler of the 5th
house, the house of pleasures. Venus is sextile to Jupiter.
All these facts show that this man has been very popular
with his women friends, who have entertained him
lavishly, and the pleasures of the table have helped in his
undoing.
The planet which helps to bring about physical
ailments, the inflammatory Mars, is in the sign of the
intestines, Virgo, square to the Moon in Gemini,
showing that the intestines suffered first from an excess
of food and drink. When the small intestines are THE THROAT 125 inflamed, as they would be in this case, they are unable
to assimilate food properly. This inflammation throws
considerable poison into the blood, which seeks an outlet
in the weakest spot. Saturn conjunct Neptune in Taurus
indicates that the throat received the poison. This man
has had his throat lanced twice for what the doctors
termed quinsy, an inflammation of the tonsils. He has
had pieces taken from the tonsils, showing that the blood
was contaminated, causing suppuration in the tonsils. 126 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 3D—GOITER—TONSILS
Female, born August 12, 1911, 7:27 A.M. W E will consider here the horoscope of a girl
with Virgo on the Ascendant. Virgo people
have somewhat less resistance to disease than the
average, especially when common signs occupy the four
angles and Mercury and the Moon, which rule the
mentality, are also in common signs and in opposition to
each other. The three strongest planets, namely, the Sun,
Saturn, and Mars, are in fixed signs. We may expect that
these planets will indicate in what part of the body the
disease will show itself.
The sign of Taurus, we are told in The Message of
the Stars, page 541, has rule over the neck, throat,
tonsils, the carotid arteries, etc. From this we may infer
that Taurus also has rule over the veins and arteries
which serve the organs located in the throat. Likewise it
has rule over the lower part of the occipital region of the
jaw. The arteries of the human body have their beginning
in a common center. The aorta is to the circulatory
system what the trunk is to the tree. All main arteries and
veins have a connection with the great human engine, the
heart. The aorta is the main trunk line, from which many
branches carry the blood to all parts of the body, after
which the veins carry it back to the heart. These branches
feed the various parts of the body. The branch in which
we are most interested in this lesson is the carotid artery, THE THROAT 127 from which branch off the thyroid arteries, two in
number, the superior and the inferior.
In this horoscope we have the inflammatory Mars in
Taurus. Mars focuses heat, and wherever this planet is
placed we find an abundance of blood. Mars here is in
the sign ruling the neck and afflicted by the conjunction of Saturn, the planet of obstruction. Saturn has a dryingup effect upon the parts which he influences. The effect 128 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS of these two malefic planets may be pictured by filling a
rubber tube with water and closing both ends, then
pinching one end of the tube and forcing the water into
the other end. We may expect this to be the condition of
the blood in the arteries and veins of this girl's neck.
Mars fills them full of blood, and Saturn with his
restricting influence holds the blood in one part,
obstructing its flow and resulting in enlarged veins of the
neck, goiter, swollen tonsils, etc. Saturn and Mars are
afflicted by a square from the life-giving Sun. The Sun is
strong in its own home, Leo, which rules the vena cava,
the aorta, and the heart.
At the age of eleven years this young girl suffered
with goiter and swollen tonsils, having constant trouble
with the throat and a tendency to coughs and colds. One
important fact will be found in the case of most children
with a tendency to throat trouble, namely, that they
formed the habit when tiny babies of breathing through
the mouth. In nine cases out of ten, of children who are
suffering with diseased tonsils and throat afflictions, they
have not been taught to breathe through the nose. Parents
should at all times watch small children, and if they
show a tendency to mouth breathing while asleep, they
should be given a solid rubber nipple, minus the opening.
This will force the breath through the nostrils and
thereby save the child much suffering in later years.
With the Sun in Leo, square to Saturn and Mars, this
girl has a latent tendency to valvular heart trouble. This
may not develop until later in life when the Mars- THE THROAT 129 conjunction-Saturn-in-Taurus temper has been permitted
to do its damage, and Mercury in Virgo in opposition to
the Moon, in the 12th and 6th houses, the latter ruling the
health, have made themselves felt.
There is great hope in this horoscope, however, due
to Saturn being in trine aspect to Mercury and sextile to
the Moon. This will give balance and also persistence to
the mind, which will help to stave off any illness and
save the girl much suffering in later life. 130 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS No. 3E—GOITER
Female, born June 14, 1853 A S we have no birth hour, the signs are entered
on the houses in numerical order so that Aries
occupies the first house, Taurus the second, Gemini the
third, etc. and the noon positions of the planets are used
just as they are given in the ephemeris.
We will first note that the progressed position of the
Sun in 1916 is Leo 23°27’, and that of Mercury is Leo
26°27’, retrograde (Rx).
The aspects which particularly concern us are: Moon
parallel Neptune, square Jupiter, the Sun and Mercury;
Jupiter opposition the Sun and Mercury; Saturn parallel
and conjunction Mars, squared by the progressed Sun
and Mercury.
We will first acquaint ourselves with the condition of
the mind of this woman. Gemini and Sagittarius are the
signs ruling mind. Mercury is essentially dignified in
Gemini, and Jupiter in Sagittarius. The Sun also is
favorably situated in the Mercurial sign Gemini. So far
so good, but Mercury, our significator of the mind,
follows the Sun and is too close to this luminary;
furthermore, Jupiter is in opposition to the Sun and
Mercury. Add to this that the Moon, the other
significator of the mind, is square to Jupiter, the Sun, and
Mercury, and it will be apparent that the mental state of
the native is not a very happy or auspicious one. THE THROAT 131 Saturn is in Taurus, the sign of the throat. He is the
planet of obstruction and has always an inimical
influence on whatever part of the body he occupies by sign. We may therefore judge that the throat will be
obstructed, causing hoarseness of speech; and we may
also be sure that Saturn has an effect in the opposite sign
Scorpio, which governs the generative and eliminative
organs. Saturn is cold, clammy, and moist. Mars is hot 132 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS and dry. He is posited in the sign Taurus, closely
conjoined and parallel with Saturn, giving a tendency to
inflammation and swelling. In the region governed by
the opposite sign he would produce scaling urine and
copious menses.
Thus two inimical forces of opposite natures have
been at war in the region of the throat from birth on, but
the case did not become really acute until 1914. Then the
Moon by progression reached the opposition of the
radical Sun and Mercury, and at the same time the Sun
by progression came within orb of a square to Saturn and
Mars from the sign Leo, which governs the heart. The
keynote of Saturn is obstruction, and in Taurus he is
particularly powerful with respect to the heart action for
he governs the pneumogastric nerve which produces
cardiac inhibition. On the other hand, when the dynamic
energy of Mars is directed by a square to the progressed
Sun in Leo violent palpitation is bound to be the effect.
Thus the enormous range of heart action attendant upon
exophthalmic goiter is produced in this case. We also
find that Saturn is near a conjunction with the Pleiades
located in Taurus 29°, and his square to the progressed
Sun has an effect upon the eyes, which protrude in
people affected with exophthalmic goiter.
The configurations of the significators of mind
previously mentioned, coupled with the absence of
radical squares and oppositions to Saturn and Mars,
indicate that the basic cause of the patient's condition is
mental. The diagnosis is further confirmed by the fact THE THROAT 133 that the acute condition was brought about by the abovenoted progressed positions of the Sun and Mercury. As
this affliction is from a fixed sign there is danger that the
condition may become chronic. If the person, however,
is placed in a quiet, cheerful environment and if she can
be taught to wean herself from her morbid imagination,
there is a good chance of a permanent cure being
accomplished when the Sun gets out of orb of its square
to Saturn and Mars, particularly if the proper diet is
adopted. 134 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 3F—THE VOCAL ORGANS
Male, born May 30, 1919, 11:55 Plutão .M.
The tissue of the life to be
We weave with colors all our own,
And in the field of destiny
We reap as we have sown.
—Whittier T HIS is truly so in the life of the soul whose
horoscope we are to study here.
With the fixed, saturnine sign of Aquarius on the
Ascendant and the second ruler of Aquarius, the
inspirational and advanced Uranus, in Pisces, intercepted
in the first house, we may say that there are really two
rulers of this horoscope: Saturn, which is in its fall in the
seventh house in Leo, and Uranus, which is strong in the
occult sign of Pisces in the first house.
Planets in angles have a greater influence on the life
of the native than when they are in cadent or succedent
houses. Planets which are in fixed signs and afflicted
also bring with them a debt of destiny, which is usually
most difficult to overcome.
In this horoscope we find Mercury in the fixed sign
of Taurus, square to the obstinate and obstructive planet,
Saturn, which is in Leo, a fixed sign, and in the seventh
house angle. THE THROAT 135 Saturn, being one of the life rulers, though in the
sign of its fall, will have the most powerful rule over the
life, and when Mercury and Saturn are afflicting each
other from bestial signs, namely, Taurus and Leo, we
may look for an impediment in the speech. This boy at the age of five years refused to talk. He
is able to speak, but will do so only when the greatest
persuasion is used. 136 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Doctors have operated on him twice for water on the
brain but have failed to find anything wrong, and what
the effect of these operations may have upon the
organism in the future remains to be seen. Up to the
present time, however, the health of the boy has been
normal.
He will repeat only the sentences which are
suggested to him, but if the parents are persistent they
may in time help him to overcome his weakness.
On page 154, in the Cosmo-Conception we are told:
“What we are, what we have, all our good qualities are
the result of our own actions in the past. What we lack in
physical, moral, or mental excellence may yet be ours in
the future.”
This boy has truly taken up his life where he laid it
down in a previous one. The planets are the clock of
destiny, which shows when each soul must needs learn
certain lessons, when it must reap from the seeds which
it has sown in its past lives.
We learn in the Rosicrucian teachings that we are in
this life here on earth preparing to build the archetype of
the body which we are to use in our next life. In the case
of this poor soul as we look back into his past, we see
where in his keen desire for spiritual development he
neglected to build his physical body by mortifying the
flesh and neglected to use the organs of speech, being a
member of a silent Brotherhood, in which the life was
spent in silence and prayer. In this extremely one-sided THE THROAT 137 life he developed the spiritual faculties at the expense of
the physical senses.
We see here the mystical Uranus is in the sign of
Pisces, in the first house, trine to the Moon, which is in
its own sign of Cancer. Neptune, another spiritual planet,
is parallel to Mercury and sextile to Mars and the Sun,
indicating a soul who is highly developed along spiritual
lines, but one who is lacking in the ability to use his
development in this life on account of the lack of desire
to use the organs of speech.
This child may, however, be assisted by the parents
in developing this desire, but it will require great
patience, as the mentality, on account of Mercury square
Saturn, will be slow to respond, and the boy will be very
stubborn, because of this aspect being from fixed signs.
Mars, however, which is in the Mercurial sign of
Gemini, will lend its assistance in overcoming the
influence of Saturn to some extent. 138 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 3G—THE LOSS OF SPEECH
Male, born December 19th, 1896, at 12:30 A.M. T HE young man whose horoscope we will
analyze here has the cardinal and airy sign of
Libra on the Ascendant. Physically he expresses the sign
of Libra, being six feet in height, splendidly developed
and with beautiful blue eyes. People with cardinal or
fixed signs on the angles have more power of resistance
than others. The will is stronger than that of common
signs. In the case of this young man, however, we find
an affliction active before he reached the age where he
could be of assistance to the healers.
In the Cosmo-Conception we are told that in the
latter part of the Lemurian Epoch man's body became
upright, this being necessary before he would become an
indwelling, self-conscious being, and certain changes
then had to take place in the bodily structure in order that
the Ego might express itself through its vehicles. When
the Ego entered within its vehicles, it was necessary that
part of the sex force be used to build the brain and
larynx, for it was destined that man should henceforth
learn to do his own thinking, and the voice was
necessary that he might make himself understood and
thereby communicate with others. To accomplish this a
part of his sex force had to be used. So a part of the
creative organ remained with the upper portion of the
body, and was gradually converted into what now THE THROAT 139 constitutes the brain and larynx. Thus we may see that
there must of necessity be a close connection between
these organs, namely, the generative organs, larynx, and
brain. It is interesting to note through astrology how this
works out. We find Scorpio, the sign ruling sex, in
opposition to Taurus, which has rule over the throat and
larynx. Proof of the above close connection may also be 140 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS found in the boy whose voice changes at puberty; also in
the woman who has had her ovaries removed and whose
voice becomes deep and harsh.
In the horoscope under consideration we find Saturn,
the planet of atrophy, in the sign of Scorpio. Saturn is in
conjunction with Uranus. These two planets are
unaspected save by the conjunction with each other and a
semi-sextile to the Sun. And this we must consider as a
condition which had its beginning in a past life. When
we find Uranus and Saturn in conjunction in Scorpio and
afflicted by other planets, we look for perversion or
abnormal sex expression. But in reading these two
planets we go into the past life for the abuses which have
weakened the organs, causing the poor soul to come into
this life with the larynx and brain each unable to function
normally.
With Saturn conjunction Uranus in Scorpio we may
look for its effect in the opposite sign of Taurus, the
throat. Saturn then has a tendency to retard or restrict the
secretion of the fluids of the glands or organs within the
region of the neck—for instance, the thyroid, which is
placed astride the windpipe at the front of the neck, and
which may truly be called the balance necessary for the
proper functioning of the mind. The thyroid also
regulates all the other ductless glands, and every drop of
blood in the circulation in the upper part of the body
passes back and forth through it. Excesses or perversions
of sex deplete the fluids of the thyroid gland. What a
telltale the human voice is! How the misuse of sex will THE THROAT 141 make the male voice effeminate and the female voice
masculine!
In this horoscope we have the story of a man who at
birth had a voice, but after the age of four years he would
not make a sound, nor has he spoken a word since. The
organs ruling the voice in this case have been weakened
by the dissipation of the sex fluids in a former life. We
find Neptune, the higher octave of Mercury, the planet
ruling the pineal gland, in the mercurial sign of Gemini,
in conjunction with the Moon and Mars, and in
opposition to the Sun. Neptune has rule over the pineal
gland and the spinal spirit fire. The brain in this case has
remained childlike. The young man dresses himself but
he will not speak, and he spends his entire time turning
the leaves of books.
Truly, the spirit encased in this limited vehicle is
learning some remarkable lessons—lessons which are
likely to bring it back in its next embodiment as a
childlike, virtuous woman. CHAPTER XV THE LUNGS
NO. 4A—TUBERCULOSIS T HE horoscope here shown is that of a well-to-do
man who spoiled his life by excesses of all
kinds. He was born on August 28, 1881, at 11 Plutão .M.
In the first place, we find Jupiter, the planet of
opulence, in the 12th house, that of sorrow, trouble, and
self-undoing, sextile to Venus, the planet of attraction, in
Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach, and in the 2nd
house, that of finance. This accounts for the native's
business instinct in money matters as well as his desire
for rich and unhealthful foods; in part, too, for his fatal
weakness for the opposite sex. The Moon square to
Venus from the fifth house, the house of pleasures, also
Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, conjunct the
saturnine Dragon's Tail, and both square to Uranus, the
planet of unconventionality and clandestine attachments,
are other strong testimonies in the latter direction. 142 THE LUNGS 143 Furthermore, Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in the
12th house, that of sorrow, in conjunction with Neptune,
the planet of underhandedness, in Taurus, which is the
opposite of Scorpio, the sign governing the sex organs,
shows trouble in that region and also in the throat. As a whole, this horoscope shows all manner of
excesses, and a consequent clogging up of the system.
Venus in Cancer, the latter ruling the stomach, gives a 144 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS love of good things to eat, and especially to drink. Its
square to the Moon in the sign Libra, ruling the kidneys,
shows that there was a very bad condition there
preventing proper elimination. The conjunction of
Saturn, the planet of obstruction, with Neptune in the
sign Taurus, this sign having a reflex action in Scorpio,
resulted in painful hemorrhoids. Mars, the planet of
dynamic energy, conjoined with the saturnine Dragon's
Tail in Gemini, the sign ruling the lungs, square to
Uranus, the planet of spasmodic action, shows a
tendency to coughs and weakness of the lungs, which
finally destroyed the life.
This horoscope is a lesson on the ravages of excess
and indulgence of the lower nature, and astrologers may
use it for the purpose of convincing people who are on
the downward path that the way of the transgressor is
hard, and that our sins will surely find us out. By the
exercise of will power, at least a great deal of the trouble
indicated might have been avoided. Toward the last the
man realized that he was going down and wanted help,
but he was too weak to cease from his indulgences.
Consequently he yielded to the tendencies shown in his
horoscope, and became the victim of tuberculosis and a
number of complications. THE LUNGS 145 NO. 4B—TUBERCULOSIS
Female, born June 16, 1884, 8:30 A.M. S UFFERING from tuberculosis is shown very
plainly by this horoscope, for Saturn, the planet
of obstruction and crystallization, is in Gemini, the sign
which rules the lungs. Although he is unaspected he
always has a malefic bodily influence in whatever part of
the chart he is placed. His obstructive and hardening
tendencies clog and crystallize the lungs and would be
inimical even if he were not supported by evil aspects.
We find that the Sun, which is the giver of life, is also in
Gemini, square to the Moon, which is the particular
significator of health in a woman's horoscope. The Moon
is placed in the 8th house, the house of death, in Pisces,
the twelfth sign, ruling confinement in hospitals and
kindred institutions. The Sun is also square to the
spasmodic Uranus, and Uranus is in opposition to the
Moon. This will produce the cough and the hemorrhage
which are part of the symptoms of tuberculosis.
Leo, the strong solar sign, is rising, and Jupiter, the
planet of optimism and joviality, is therein sextile to
Mercury, the planet of reason and mind. We may also
note that all the angles are occupied by fixed signs.
These conditions show that in the first place the
constitution was a good one, that the native had to begin
with a strong, vigorous nature and a jovial sunny and
friendly disposition. Had this horoscope been set up in 146 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS childhood's days so that one could have worked with the
native and counteracted the tendencies to tuberculosis,
the chances are that she would have entirely outgrown this tendency. As it is, however, the squares and
oppositions of the Sun, Moon, and Uranus taken together
with the Moon's placement in the 8th house and the 12th
house sign show that this case is likely to terminate
fatally. The best that can be done for the patient now is THE LUNGS 147 to make her suffering as little as possible. The magnetic
force of an Aries person whose Saturn is not in any of
the degrees encompassed by the 6th house of the
patient's horoscope would be of great help to her, and
milk just fresh from the cow would do a great deal to
keep up her vitality as it is filled with the healthy animal
ether. 148 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 4C—TUBERCULOSIS
Male, born December 1, 1883, 3:51 A.M. B Áries mistake this chart was first set up so that Leo
occupied the Ascendant and the Sun was in the
fifth house. The planets show the affliction no matter
what sign rises, but a glance showed the figure to be
erroneous because the Sun cannot be in the fifth house at
four o'clock in the morning. So we had it calculated
again, with the result that we find Saturn in the eighth
house instead of in the eleventh and the Sun in the
second house instead of the fifth. This makes a great deal
of difference in the strength of the symptoms. We would
advise students that whenever they are given a figure for
judgment it is wise precaution always to look at the place
of the Sun and notice if its location in the horoscope
corresponds with its actual place in the sky at the time of
day when the birth took place. If it does not, that is
evidence that the horoscope has been incorrectly set up
and is therefore unfit to be used as a basis of judgment.
We are all liable to make mistakes in our calculations but
this hint will undoubtedly help students to avoid this
particular mistake.
The subject of this horoscope is suffering from
tuberculosis, a disease neither necessarily serious nor
fatal. The student of Astro-Diagnosis has special
facilities for judging how deeply the disease is rooted by
the positions and aspects of the afflicting planets. Saturn, THE LUNGS 149 the planet of obstruction, in Gemini, the sign which rules
the lungs, shows the tendency to cold in the lungs and
also hardening such as occurs in tuberculosis. But this
testimony would not have been so dangerous if it had come from the position shown in the erroneously cast
figure where Saturn was placed in the eleventh house,
instead of its position in the true horoscope where he is
in the eighth house, denoting the manner of death. 150 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Mercury, the ruler of Gemini, is in opposition to
Saturn, and so is the life-giving Sun. We may also note
that the Moon, which governs the tidal air in the lungs, is
in conjunction with Venus, which rules the venous
blood, and is square to Uranus. All these are signs which
show that there is comparatively little hope of escape for
this patient from the dread disease until death looses the
silver cord and frees him from the body.
You will notice that the last degrees of Libra are
rising so that the native has really more of the impulsive
Scorpio characteristics than those of Libra. Mars, ruler of
Scorpio, in Leo adds to his energy and makes him fond
of swaggering and showing off, prodigal of his vitality.
Mars trine Mercury in Sagittarius shows an inclination
for sport and probably overexertion, which may have
been responsible for the first breakdown about the
twenty-eighth year when the progressed Moon was over
the place of the radical Moon and Venus, or the year
preceding when it was in opposition to Saturn.
It would be extreme cruelty to tell the patient that
there is little hope, of course, and no aspirant to invisible
helpership would be so thoughtless, but would strive to
make his lot as easy as possible during the remaining
time, though realizing that whatever measures were
taken would only palliate but not cure. Meanwhile, it
should be made clear to the person that there is a
spiritual reason for disease and that occult investigations
have established the fact that a materialistic conception
of life in a previous embodiment is a fruitful source of THE LUNGS 151 just such a condition as this one, for by the thought that
death ends all, the materialist gradually puts himself out
of tune with all activities in the spiritual world. When he
enters the Second Heaven where the archetypes of new
bodies are built, he puts all his crystallizing thoughts into
the new vehicle, which is then born under the hardening
rays of Saturn, who in some way obstructs the life-giving
Sun. If such a patient can be taught to believe this and
become a devoted Christian, he will be saved a similar
fate in a future life. CHAPTER XVI
THE HEART
NO. 5A—THE HEART
Female, born October 16, 1907, 2:00 Plutão .M. A QUARIUS, a fixed and airy sign, is on the
Ascendant. The fiery planet Mars is just above
the cusp in the 12th house, and the plastic and watery
Moon is in the same sign in the first house. This gave
this young woman a very strange nature, for there is a
great difference between the temperaments given by the
Moon and Mars. Mars on the Ascendant afflicted by a
parallel to the ruler, the impulsive Uranus, gave the
native a very impulsive nature. It indicates one who
would fly into a fit of rage at the least provocation. The
two natures given by Mars and the Moon were
continually at war with each other, the one impulsive,
energetic, dynamic, and the other restless, plastic, and
changeable. The Moon, however, is trine to the Sun,
which gave a soft, peaceable, kindly nature, directly
opposed to the martial temperament. The restless, critical
Mercury is placed near the Midheaven in the martial sign
of Scorpio; this added to the temper. 152 THE HEART 153 Planets when situated in angles and in fixed signs, as
are several in this horoscope, have a larger orb than
otherwise, and we give eight degrees or a little more to
the major planets in such cases. We would consider Jupiter here to be in opposition to Mars. Venus is in
square aspect to Mars, and Mercury is parallel to Venus
and square to Jupiter. With Venus ruling the venous
blood and Jupiter the arterial blood, both being afflicted 154 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS by Mars and Jupiter by Mercury also, this young woman
suffered from restricted circulation, especially due to the
fact that the afflictions are all from fixed signs and
angles, which affected the action of the heart. With her
high-strung, nervous temperament and uncontrolled fits
of temper she precipitated an attack of heart trouble each
time she permitted herself to be ruled by this emotion.
There are also indications of inharmony in the home,
for we find the rulers of the 10th and 4th houses, Venus
and Mars, in square aspect. Mars is also the ruler of the
3rd house, which stands for sisters and brothers. The
above aspect would indicate that this young girl was
greatly domineered by those in the home, and being of a
very impulsive and dominant nature herself, this
provoked much display of temper, which was very
injurious to the health of one with the above planetary
configurations.
In 1917 the progressed Sun reached the square to the
radical Mars, while the progressed Mars was in
conjunction with the Ascendant. The result was that a
chronic condition of heart trouble set in which slowly led
to dropsy, for restricted heart action frequently bring
about other complications. The doctors, unfortunately,
were unable to diagnose the disease correctly, and she
was treated for Bright's disease. In 1921 the progressed
Moon reached the opposition to its radical place at birth.
This opposition usually marks the beginning of puberty,
and is sometimes a critical period for young girls,
especially when Venus and Jupiter are both afflicted. THE HEART 155 When the Moon passed through Leo, the sign of the
heart, while making the opposition to its radical place, it
aggravated the dropsy, for the Moon in Leo or Aquarius
has a tendency to cause dropsy in a patient suffering with
heart trouble.
Uranus, the planet of impulse and the higher octave
of Venus, which also has an influence over the
circulatory system, is in opposition to Neptune in
Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach. Neptune is in the
6th house, health; this would indicate that there was
trouble with the digestive organs and an abnormal desire
for indigestible food.
The young woman's parents called upon
Headquarters for healing after the doctors had given her
up. They were told that the case was hopeless. She
passed out three weeks after she was put on our healing
list. The case was an incurable one when it reached our
hands. She died in February, 1921. We may here see
how powerful afflictions are and how difficult to
overcome when they are from fixed signs and in the
angles. This was truly a debt of destiny which this soul
was called upon to pay, and it was beyond the power of
the Invisible Helpers. 156 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 5B—HEART; KIDNEYS
Male, born October 25, 1862, at 5:20 A.M. W E will use here the horoscope of a man with
Libra on the Ascendant and cardinal signs on
all the angles. The planet of obstruction, Saturn, is
exalted in Libra, and is placed in the twelfth house.
Saturn is in opposition to Mars and Neptune. Mars and
Neptune are in conjunction and parallel with each other.
We have here three malefic planets, one in the 12th
house, ruling hospitals, and two in the 6th house, the
house of sickness. The twelfth and the sixth houses are
very dangerous positions for planets afflicting each other
by opposition.
Saturn in Libra, when afflicted, causes obstruction of
the renal secretions, and lack of these secretions disturbs
the chemical laboratory of the kidneys. Poisons are
thrown off by the blood after it passes through the renal
arteries to the kidneys, where it is purified and undergoes
a thorough filtering process, leaving its poisons such as
urea, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, potash, lime, and
other refuse matter which it has taken from the food.
If the kidneys are healthy, these organs receive
enough water from the blood to dissolve these poisonous
secretions, which are then washed out from the kidneys
as urine. But in a case such as we have for our diagnosis,
where Saturn is afflicted in Libra, this washing out is not
fully accomplished. The kidneys retain some of these THE HEART 157 poisonous secretions, which become hardened mineral
matter. In the course of time a hardening process
develops and the kidneys refuse to function properly.
The result is that the blood is not purified, and this
mineral matter is lodged in the blood vessels, which
become clogged, and the circulation becomes impaired. The eyes are closely allied with the kidneys, and
when the latter organs are sluggish and filled with
mineral matter, the eyesight becomes impaired. 158 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS People with Mars in Aries have a desire to drink
much liquid, as in the case of this man, who was afflicted
with an unquenchable thirst. As the kidneys were not
able to extract the excess water from the blood, this
liquid, which was not eliminated through the skin,
remained in the blood, and in time the man suffered from
palpitation of the heart and dropsy. His case was
diagnosed by the doctors as heart disease. People
suffering with this affliction have very scanty and very
highly colored urine.
If a case of this kind is taken in time, the kidneys can
be flushed and the poisons eliminated by a proper diet.
String beans, carrots, asparagus, and tomatoes are most
helpful in stimulating the kidneys and assisting in the
elimination of water. Onions are astringents, and where
there is an excess of urine, the onion will regulate it.
Therefore it is very necessary that the vegetables be
properly chosen to work against and not with the disease. THE HEART 159 NO. 5C—THE HEART
Male, born October 6th, 1855, 1:00 A.M.
We shape, ourselves, the joy or fear
Of which the coming life is made,
And fill our Futures' atmosphere
With sunshine or with shade.
We weave with colors all our own
The tissues of the Life to be,
And in the field of Destiny
We reap as we have sown.
Still shall the soul around it call
The shadows which it gathered here,
And, painted on the eternal wall,
The past shall reappear.
Think ye the notes of holy song
On Milton's tuneful ear have died?
Think ye that Raphael's angel throng
Has vanished from his side?
Oh, no! we live our life again;
Or warmly touched, or coldly dim,
The pictures of the past remain—
Man's work shall follow him!
—Whittier Well may we say of the soul whose destiny we read
through this mystic scroll that his work in the past
followed him. He hewed a path for himself, and chose
one that was rough and rocky. His was the path of a 160 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS leader of men, for he had the sign of Leo on the
Ascendant, with the Moon in conjunction with Mars and
the Ascendant and sextile to the ruler, the Sun. He also had fixed signs on the four angles and five planets
therein. This is the sign of a strong soul, a man who will
never lean on anyone, but who will be a doer, a lifter; as
such he spent his life. This was a man who carried his
cross willingly and who bore the stripes of the cruelties THE HEART 161 of the world uncomplainingly. One with such signs on
the angles and with the planets as strongly placed as in
this horoscope and afflicting one another surely finds his
life full of lessons, and many responsibilities are placed
upon him.
In his home he was most unhappy, as we see from
Mercury in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail in
Scorpio in the 4th house. This indicates that the wife was
a nagger and a scold. Mercury in Scorpio shows that the
wife would never permit the husband to have a moment's
peace. Then we find Saturn in Cancer. Cancer is the
natural fourth house sign. Saturn is square to Venus,
again indicating a masterful and discordant marriage
partner. With Jupiter in the seventh house, in opposition
to the Moon and Mars and square to Uranus, marriage
and partnership are shown to be accompanied by many
trials and much opposition.
In spite of all this we find that this man achieved
quite a fortune, did a big work, and made many friends.
He was a leader in Masonry, where he did many kind
acts, helping the widow and orphan generously with his
money. He was deeply interested in prison work and also
in occult studies. Neptune in Pisces, sextile to Uranus,
shows his interest in occultism, but both these planets are
retrograde, which brought him all kinds of restrictions.
He was never free to follow his higher ideals.
With his many crosses, hard work, and
disappointments he developed heart trouble of a very
serious nature, and for years he used heart stimulants so 162 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS as to keep at his work. He never allowed his physical
sufferings to interfere with his business, however, which
was of a very responsible nature, with many branches
scattered over a large part of America; also he had many
men under him. With leakage of the valves of the heart
and in spite of the resulting suffering he lived to the ripe
old age of seventy years. We may see from this that the
will can be used to overcome and that man is truly the
master of his fate. Had this man had Virgo on the
Ascendant or some other sign less strong than Leo,
together with the afflictions from fixed signs, he would
have become a confirmed invalid or have passed out as a
young man. Hence we may see that “the wise man rules
his stars; the fool is ruled by them.” THE HEART 163 NO. 5D—HEART DISEASE
Male, born September 12, 1858, 8:15 A.M. O UR first concern when diagnosing this
horoscope is to ascertain the mental caliber of
the patient. Jupiter placed in the house of the higher
mind and Mars near the cusp of the house of the lower
mind are in opposition, also square to the Sun and
Mercury, a fact which stamps the native as a pessimist of
an irritable nature. This is accentuated by the opposition
of Mercury to Neptune, the lower mind being out of tune
with all spiritual concepts. Saturn square Venus prevents
the native from seeing the beauty of life. As these
adverse testimonies are only counterbalanced by the
Moon sextile Mercury and the Sun, and trine Neptune,
we may conclude that this person is in a sad state and
needs all the help and cheer it is possible to bring him.
We are afraid that even the best efforts will avail little
against such a barrier of pessimism as he has built
around himself.
Regarding the disease to which he is subject, the
cold hand of Saturn in Leo shows us the obstructed heart
action, and the consequent sluggish circulation is
designated by the square of Saturn to Venus and the
square of the Sun and Mercury to Jupiter, for Jupiter and
Venus govern the arterial and venous circulations
respectively. Uranus sextile Saturn produces a spasmodic
action felt as a fluttering of the heart; and being posited 164 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS in Gemini he also imparts a spasmodic motion to the
lungs, making it at times difficult for the patient to
breathe, though the condition is not so well defined as in
asthma. The affliction of the Sun and Mercury in Virgo opposition Neptune indicates intestinal trouble. The
affliction of the Sun and Mercury by Jupiter and Mars
from the houses of travel, also the opposition of the lastnamed planets, show a predisposition to accidents, THE HEART 165 especially when on a journey. With this phase of the
indications we are not, however, concerned at the present
time.
We may bend our efforts to accelerate the action of
the heart and promote impaired digestion in order to give
the person relief and a brighter outlook upon life. As
Saturn controls the pneumogastric nerve, his presence in
Leo shows us that this is the principal seat of the trouble,
for this nerve inhibits the heart action and acts also upon
other vital organs. It is difficult to reach this nerve in an
efficient manner when we are clothed in our dense
bodies. But the conscientious Rosicrucian health adjuster
has other means at his disposal, for his Obligation to
himself taken before the Elder Brothers enables him to
work upon his patients during the hours when his body is
sleeping. And he is taught how he may materialize
fingers inside the body of the ailing and thus give the
needed help to remove obstructions, growths, etc.—yes,
even to adjust displaced bones. We receive many letters
at Headquarters from patients who sense the presence of
the Invisible Helpers and the withdrawal of hands from
their bodies at the moment when they awake.
The best method to treat such a case as this would be
for the healer to thoroughly impress upon his or her mind
where the seat of the malady is to be found,
physiologically and astrologically. Then after
retrospection in the evening say, “Now, I will go to help
my patient under the direction of the Elder Brothers,”
letting that be the last waking thought. 166 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS The healer best fitted to take charge of this case
would be one whose rising sign is in harmony with
Libra. Aquarius would be the first choice and Gemini the
second. It is further required that he or she should not
have Saturn in Libra or Pisces. NO. 5E—THE HEART
Female, born September 18, 1854, 10:00 A.M. H ERE we have a horoscope with the energetic,
active, and aggressive sign of Scorpio on the
Ascendant, with the life ruler, Mars, in the 1st house
within orb of the Ascendant and in its own sign, where a
planet has the greatest power either for good or evil. In
the case of this woman this martial energy is dissipated
and not kept under control, for the planet Mars is in
opposition to the erratic and impulsive Uranus which is
posited in the 7th house in the fixed sign of Taurus
where it is in its fall and therefore apt to show its evil
side. The combined influence of Mars and Uranus, both
being planets of impulse, acts like a fire fanned by the
wind which has got beyond control.
We find the watery Moon near the Midheaven in the
hot, fiery, and fixed sign of Leo, and this planet is in
square aspect to both the above planets of impulse. Fire THE HEART 167 in contact with water generates steam. This affliction of
the planets of fire to the watery and emotional Moon has
a similar effect upon the mind of this woman. Mars in
Scorpio afflicted and on the Ascendant gives an uncontrolled temper, showing a woman who would fly
into a rage at the least provocation and this anger is apt
to be directed toward the marriage partner. If we place a
kettle of water on a fire which is kept fanned into a red 168 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS heat, in time the water boils down, the bottom of the
kettle becomes dry and burns out. In this state we find
this woman. For years she has created such a nervous
and emotional environment about her in her home that
the poor heart has been burned and scorched, for the
Moon afflicted in Leo indicates that the heart has been
under a great strain. The result is that in the year 1916,
when the progressed Moon reached the conjunction of
the radical Mars in the 1st house and later the opposition
of Uranus in the 7th house (indicating the husband),
domestic relations reached a critical point. With the
progressed Venus, Mercury, Sun, and Moon all
transiting the 1st house and in the martial sign of
Scorpio, the resulting fiery emotions were too much for
the body, and the poor woman lost all control of herself.
She wanted to cry all the time, she could not digest her
food, and would often swoon away with heart trouble.
There is, however, another cause for this physical
break. We find a wonderfully strong and well-fortified
Neptune in its own sign of Pisces in the occult 4th house,
in sextile to Jupiter and Uranus and trine to Mars. These
aspects, especially the sextile between the two occult
planets, Neptune and Uranus, ordinarily give a strong
desire for development along mystical lines and would
cause one to develop rapidly. But Neptune is making a
square to Saturn, and Uranus is square to the Moon. Evil
aspects between planets as well as good will bring
development, but the development is of a different
nature. THE HEART 169 As we have often stated in our lessons, anger and
evil emotions are much more injurious to a person who
is endeavoring to live the higher life than if he were
content to drift and be of the earth earthy. Each time that
this woman gave way to her anger she set in motion a
counter-clockwise vibration, a fire that burned up the
spiritual life that had been awakened, and the poor body
could not stand the strain. She cannot long continue
placing this strain upon the heart, for with the squares
and opposition of Mars, Moon, and Uranus from angles
and fixed signs, the heart will not be able to stand the
strain and death may be very sudden. CHAPTER XVII THE STOMACH
NO. 6A—STOMACH TROUBLE AND
TUBERCULOSIS I N the diagnosis of disease by the science of the
stars it is sometimes most difficult to know in
what direction the afflictions may work. For instance, we
have so often written of the sinister effects of Saturn in
Cancer, the sign which has rule over the stomach. When
he afflicts in this sign he robs the stomach of its gastric
juice, which is necessary for the digestion of the food.
Saturn in this place has also a tendency to create a desire
for unhealthful foods and leads to the excessive use of
cream, sugar, desserts, etc. But in this lesson and the
next we will endeavor to show how Saturn when placed
in the opposite sign, Capricorn—in which Saturn is at
home and where his influence is much more subtle and
malevolent than when he is in the sign of Cancer—has
similar effects.
We will use two horoscopes by which we will show
the effects of Saturn in Capricorn whereby diseases are
produced of vastly different natures. We will first use 170 THE STOMACH 171 horoscope 6A, which is that of a man born February 19,
1902, 3:00 Plutão .M.
We find Saturn in 23°21’ of Capricorn in the 6th
house, which has rule over the health. Saturn is in
opposition to the Moon. This last-named planet is in its
own sign of Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach. The
Moon is also in opposition to Jupiter. When Jupiter has any connection with signs or planets which rule the
appetite, he creates a desire for food in large quantities.
Whatever Jupiter does must be on a big scale; with the 172 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Moon and Jupiter in opposition we may look for the
gourmand.
With Saturn afflicted in Capricorn the gastric juice
of the stomach is sluggish, and we may expect trouble in
the digestion of the food.
If the stomach is filled with an excess of rich food,
the man will receive nourishment from only that part
which the stomach can digest. The blood is carried to the
lungs to be oxygenated. Oxygenation is to the body what
the draft is to the stove. If we shut off the draft, we
smother and kill the fire, and so it is in the body. If man
stops breathing, he dies. In shallow breathing the lungs
are not able to supply sufficient oxygen for warmth and
energy, and they do not exhale all the carbon dioxide.
In this horoscope we find Neptune in Gemini.
Gemini has rule over the lungs. Neptune is on the cusp
of the 12th house in opposition to Uranus in the 5th
house in Sagittarius. Uranus and Neptune when afflicted
indicate a nervous, cramping, spasmodic action. Neptune
here indicates that the capillaries of the lungs were
incapable of taking the amount of oxygen necessary to
oxygenate the blood. Consequently the carbon dioxide
formed faster than the lungs were able to exhale it. The
result was that poison was stored up in the system. The
nerve cells became weak and sluggish, and little by little
the body became lowered in resistive power. The
weakest organ was then unable to keep up with its work.
The bellows of the body, the lungs, in the case of this
man were unable to inhale enough air to burn up the THE STOMACH 173 poisons. The result was the lungs became diseased and
tuberculosis set in.
People with planets afflicted in common signs are
frequently susceptible to tuberculosis. With the Sun and
Mars in conjunction in Pisces, and with Uranus in
Sagittarius in opposition to Neptune in Gemini—Pisces,
Sagittarius, and Gemini being common signs—the lungs
as a consequence attracted the impurities. Hence we can
see that Saturn in either Cancer or Capricorn may be the
direct cause of disease which expresses itself in another
sign.
Three years ago this man began to suffer with
stomach trouble, which has now been followed by
tuberculosis of the lungs, a disease which had its
beginning in wrong eating. It can at this stage be cured
by a very carefully chosen diet of raw vegetables and
fruits and very little protein.
We will in our next lesson take up Horoscope 6B,
which has Saturn in Capricorn, but which has its
outcome in a quite different disease. NO. 6B
STOMACH TROUBLE AND
INFLAMMATION OF KIDNEYS
Horoscope 6B is that of a man born February 26,
1871, Júpiter Plutão .M. T HIS will be a continuation of the lesson on the
effect of Saturn in Capricorn, showing how this
planet may express its evil side through the planet which
it aspects adversely.
We find Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in the sign
of Capricorn, a cardinal sign. Signs of the like nature,
especially the cardinal signs, have an affinity for one
another and respond to afflictions more readily on that
account. In this horoscope Saturn is in Capricorn, square
to Mars in Libra, both cardinal signs. Libra rules the
kidneys and the little ducts leading from the kidneys to
the bladder, the ureters. Where we find Mars afflicted we
may look for heat and excessive action. Saturn in
Capricorn gives tendencies similar to those which he
gives in Cancer—perverted tastes, desire for strange and
unnatural foods, and a liking for sugar, pastries, etc.
Saturn in Capricorn also obstructs the flow of the
gastric juices in the stomach, hence we can see why
people with an afflicted Saturn in tropic or cardinal
signs, namely, Capricorn or Cancer, are often afflicted
with indigestion, rheumatism, uric acid deposits, etc. 174 THE STOMACH 175 When we find the inflammatory Mars in the cardinal
sign of Libra, square to Saturn in Capricorn, we may
expect that the poisonous elements which are left
undigested to ferment in the stomach will lodge in the
kidneys, creating highly acid urine, which causes
inflammation in the kidneys and ureters. In this horoscope we find the Moon in Gemini,
square to the Sun in Pisces. Gemini and Pisces, being
common signs, here obstruct the oxygenation of the 176 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS blood and interfere with its purification; hence more
impurities are sent to the kidneys from this source. Thus
we may see the similarity of causes in this horoscope and
horoscope 6A, although the results are not the same.
This man should be placed on a milk diet for several
weeks, and after the kidneys have been purified by this
system of flushing, he should eliminate all highly
seasoned and most starchy foods from his diet. NO. 6C—THE PYLORUS
Female, born March 29, 1909, 1:30 Plutão .M. W E find that this girl has a very bright mind,
with Mercury, the mental planet in sextile
aspect to the quick-witted and active planets, Mars and
Uranus, in the sign of Capricorn which gives stability
and balance, bringing the saturnine influence to bear
upon the impulse and quick wit of the last two planets.
Mercury is also making a trine to the Moon which is in
its own sign of Cancer. But we find much that is
dangerous in this active mentality should the parents
allow this child to take up the dangerous fads of mystic
writing such as the planchette, Ouija board, etc. Saturn in
the sign of the head, Aries, in square aspect to the
mystical planet Neptune, Neptune being in conjunction THE STOMACH 177 with the Moon, and the Moon in opposition to Uranus
and Mars from the 12th to the 6th house, show that some
time in life, if the parents are not careful this girl may
suffer through insanity or spirit obsession. This horoscope has another affliction which makes it
a very interesting figure for diagnosis. The Moon is in
the sign of Cancer, the stomach, in opposition to the
inflammatory Mars and the nervous and contracting
Uranus, which has a tendency to disturb digestion and 178 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS create gas in the stomach, also inflammation of the
mucous membrane. Uranus is airy, the Moon watery,
Mars fiery. In order to illustrate the effect of these three
planets upon one another, we kindle a fire, allow a strong
breeze to blow upon it, and after it is in full blaze pour
water upon it; this will describe to a certain extent the
effect of these three planets when acting upon the
stomach. Every bit of food that was taken into the
stomach created a disturbance. This child rarely tasted
food without having great distress, nausea, and vomiting;
nothing could be retained in the stomach. She was
afflicted in this manner even from birth. At the age of
eight years she was operated upon by the doctors, who
diagnosed her trouble as being in the cardiac orifice,
saying that this was too small. But the patient received
no relief from this operation.
If the physician could only have reasoned that the
vomiting and disturbance when food was in the stomach
could not have been caused by a defect in the entrance of
the stomach but by another cause deeper down in the
organ! Astrology tells us that Saturn in square to
Neptune indicates malformation, undersize. If these two
planets had been in the first part of the sign of Cancer or
the last degrees of Gemini, it would have indicated the
cardiac orifice, but we find that the Moon is in 22
degrees of Cancer, showing that it was nearer the lower
part of the organ. Mars and Uranus indicate involuntary
muscular action. Mars, when afflicting the Moon, shows
nausea, and Uranus, when afflicting the Moon, causes THE STOMACH 179 contraction. Thus we see indications that there were
involuntary muscular action and contraction which
caused nausea. But why should the food be thrown back
out of the stomach?—as the child could retain nothing.
We find an undersized pylorus, an undersized outlet.
After the food was in the stomach it could not be passed
into the intestines in the proper manner, and there being
also insufficient mucous membrane, there was faulty
digestion. Naturally vomiting would be the result.
In such a case it would have been difficult to cure
this young woman without an operation, but instead of
operating upon the cardiac orifice, the doctors should
have observed the pylorus and watched the action in this
part of the stomach. 180 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 6D—STOMACH AND KIDNEY TROUBLE
Female, born January 23, 1886, Júpiter :00 A.M. A NUMBER of operations have been performed
in the abdominal region of this patient, and she
has gone from one doctor to another, until now she is a
physical and mental wreck.
When we trace these effects back to their primal
cause, we come to Saturn in Cancer, the sign which rules
the stomach. It is our experience that most people who
have Saturn in this position are mincers and peculiar in
their choice of food. Saturn in this horoscope is square to
Jupiter, the planet of self-indulgence, and to Uranus, the
planet of spasmodic and irregular action. Thus Saturn
causes this person to indulge unduly her desire for good
things to eat.
Uranus and Jupiter in the sign Libra, which rules the
kidneys, square to Saturn, the planet of obstruction, show
that after the system has been filled with food which it
cannot assimilate, the kidneys are unable to eliminate the
waste products. Thus there is a general clogging of the
system with toxins and poisons of all kinds. Then the hot
and fiery Mars, placed in Virgo, the sign ruling the
intestines, lights the fire of inflammation in order to
cleanse the system. As the native's will power is not
particularly strong on account of the weak sign
Sagittarius rising, she is easily persuaded to undergo
operations rather than undertake a reform in her ways of THE STOMACH 181 living which would bring about an amelioration of her
condition, even at this late hour. It is very sad to say that this is the case with a great
many people. They are sometimes ready to admit being
gluttons when that fact is shown them, but in most cases
they think they are models of self-control, as far as the
appetite is concerned, even when they admit that they are
eating the wrong food. We have had a number of cases,
however, where they admitted this but claimed absolute 182 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS inability to overcome the fault and curb their appetite.
The person whose horoscope we are considering was no
exception to the general rule, and therefore all our efforts
to aid her were in vain. She would not even expend the
energy necessary to keep up the weekly letters required
of patients. In such cases there is of course nothing to do
but to leave the patient to his own resources until he
learns his lesson—if not in this life, then in some other
one. CHAPTER XVIII THE KIDNEYS
NO. 7A—THE KIDNEYS
Male, born March 14, 1892. T HE horoscope which we will use here is a flat
figure. The hour of birth is not known, but in
astro-diagnosis it is not necessary that we have the hour
of birth unless we are looking for a crisis. We must then
take into consideration the exact degree of the progressed
Moon and its aspects, also the transiting planets; but the
natural tendencies as to temperament and morals, also
the organic weaknesses, are shown by the radical
planets, which give the astrologer the key to the health of
the native, although if one has the rising sign to show the
will and the strength it is a help. Certain signs such as
Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, and Aquarius will overcome
and fight off a disease where most of the feminine signs,
especially Taurus and Virgo, have not the will power to
rise above physical conditions. Of the common signs the
sign of Gemini is the best able to control physical
ailments. 183 184 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS In this horoscope we find the Sun, the life-giver, in
the common and negative sign of Pisces. The Sun is
afflicted by an opposition and parallel of the destructive
Saturn. Here we have at the beginning an indication of
low vitality. Jupiter, the ruler of Pisces and having rule over the arterial blood, is in its own sign in conjunction
with the Sun and in opposition to Saturn. This opposition
tends to lower the vitality, for if the blood stream is THE KIDNEYS 185 stagnant, the entire body must suffer. We find Venus, the
planet having rule over the venous blood, in its own
home in Taurus where this planet is strong. Venus is
afflicted by the opposition and parallel of Uranus. This
will increase the ill effects of Jupiter and the Sun
afflicted by Saturn. With the afflicting influence of
Saturn from Virgo, the sign which has rule over the
small intestines, we may expect impaired assimilation of
food.
We find the Moon in opposition and parallel to
Jupiter and square to Mars. These aspects, coupled with
Venus in Taurus in opposition to Uranus in Scorpio,
would indicate that sensual pleasures have ruled this
young man and that his health was quickly shattered.
Uranus in Scorpio in opposition to Venus indicates
indiscretion regarding the sacred generative function,
and at the age of sixteen, when the progressed Moon had
reached the conjunction of Venus and the opposition of
Uranus, he contracted the dread disease of syphilis.
Although later seemingly cured, yet the powerful
compounds, such as those of mercury and the various
remedies used by medical science to combat this disease,
left their destructive influence in the blood, and
tuberculosis of the kidneys set in. This is shown by the
Moon in the sign of Libra, ruling the kidneys, square to
Mars, in opposition and parallel to Jupiter, and in
opposition to Mercury.
This young man entered the medical profession.
Later he was operated on and had one of his kidneys 186 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS removed, which was found to be hollow. The doctors
diagnosed his condition as tuberculosis of the kidneys.
He passed out at the age of twenty-eight. When he
reached that year, we note that the progressed Moon had
finished its cycle and had again reached its place at birth
in Libra, and the progressed Jupiter had reached the
opposition to the radical and progressed Moon. The time
when the Moon has made the circle of the whole
horoscope and reached its place at birth is a critical time,
and frequently when the Moon is afflicted in the radical
figure, this is a time of illness and one in which the
native is faced with many trials. THE KIDNEYS 187 NO. 7B—KIDNEYS AND MASTOIDITIS
Male, born May 8th, 1865, at 1:45 A.M. T HIS horoscope has the fixed sign of Aquarius on
the Ascendant, with the Sun in the fixed sign of
Taurus and in conjunction with Venus and Mercury. The
Sun is also sextile to Mars. Jupiter, the planet of
opulence and benevolence, is in the 10th house in its
own sign of Sagittarius. These positions and aspects of
the Sun and Jupiter indicate one who is a great lover of
humanity, a man who is very generous financially and
very ready to go out of his way for others, even
sacrificing his own comfort if he finds anyone whom he
can relieve of suffering or shield from harm. But we find
Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, and Saturn all retrograde. This
indicates that the man will find difficulty in realizing his
ideals and in doing as much good as his heart dictates,
for retrograde planets indicate latent talents, possibilities,
and opportunities.
Ability for earning money is very marked. This man
is also a liberal spender, having Venus in its own sign
and house—Taurus and the second house—in
conjunction with the Sun and sextile to Mars. Whatever
he does must be done on a large and generous scale. He
is a good entertainer also and a good liver, for the Sun,
Venus, and Mercury in Taurus, sextile to Mars in
Cancer, and Taurus ruling the palate, give a desire for
good things to eat and plenty of them. Likewise does 188 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Mars in Cancer, sextile to Venus and the Sun, desire
rich, highly seasoned foods and in large quantities. With Mars in the 5th house this man loves to share
with his friends. But while this generosity may have
been good for others and he has made people happy by
tickling their palates, the result has been disastrous to
himself. His health could not withstand the onslaughts
made upon the body by high living. THE KIDNEYS 189 To find in what part of the body the damage done by
excess of food will show, we look for the strongest
afflictions. We find Mars in Cancer, ruling the stomach,
square to the Moon and Saturn, which are in the sign of
Libra, Libra having rule over the kidneys. We also find
Saturn in conjunction with and parallel to the Moon. The
Moon rules the white fluids of the body and the lymph.
Saturn being the afflicter would as a result resist the free
flow of these fluids. As Jupiter, the planet ruling the
arterial blood, is in its own sign of Sagittarius, near the
Midheaven, in opposition to the nervous, excitable, and
spasmodic Uranus in the Mercurial sign of Gemini, and
as Mars is parallel to both Jupiter and Uranus, we find an
obstructed arterial circulation, with the lymphatic
circulation also impaired.
When the man is continually breaking the laws of
health by excessive eating, we may expect that the break
must come some time. In 1906, while the progressed Sun
was in conjunction with the radical Uranus in Gemini
and the progressed Moon was making a square to Mars
and an opposition to both the Moon and Saturn radical,
this man was taken down with a severe attack of
pneumonia. In 1907 the progressed Sun reached the
opposition to the radical Jupiter. This was followed in
1912 by the progressed Moon in conjunction with the
radical Mars in Cancer. During that same year the
progressed Moon afflicted by square its own place at
birth and the radical Saturn, both in Libra. This brought
on a severe attack of kidney trouble and constriction in 190 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the ureters, which interfered with the waste water
passing from the kidneys to the bladder.
At the age of thirteen, when the progressed Moon
had reached the sign of Aries, and during its transit
through this sign, it came to a conjunction with the
radical Neptune, an opposition to the radical Moon and
Saturn, a square to Mars, and a conjunction with the
Dragon's Tail. This brought on trouble with the ears and
continual headaches and earaches. When the Moon
reached the conjunction with the radical Mercury and the
retrograde progressed Venus in Taurus, inflammation of
the mastoid cells developed. The doctors operated on the
mastoid bone twice, draining the pus which had formed
in the mastoid cavity. These operations left the patient
with a chronic headache and impaired nerves.
If this man had been taught that he should eat to live
instead of living to eat he might have been saved much
suffering. THE KIDNEYS 191 NO. 7C—GENERAL BREAKDOWN
Female, born April 19, 1888, Júpiter :30 Plutão .M. J UDGING the mind first, as usual, we find that
Mercury is in conjunction with Venus and trine to
the Moon and Jupiter in fiery signs. Thus all the three
significators of mind may be said to be in trine. Jupiter is
in a measure concerned in the mental makeup because he
is ruler of the ninth sign, Sagittarius, and from him come
the benevolent impulses which are gradually lifting
humanity from savagery through civilization to
sainthood.
It is at once apparent that we have here a person of
unusually fine mentality. Even the conjunction of Saturn
with the Moon is very beneficial, for as we have often
said before, the nature of Saturn is obstruction, and when
he lays his restraining hand upon Mercury or the Moon,
it helps to steady the flighty mind and gives power of
concentration. At the same time, of course, there is a
tendency to melancholy connected with any of the
aspects of Saturn to the significators of mind. Therefore
it may be said that those who have the greatest and
deepest minds are usually of a sad disposition.
This woman is not of a deliberative nature, however.
She does not moan her days away over the sorrows and
sufferings of the world, for there are cardinal signs upon
the angles and Mars is conjunction Uranus in the first
house. This gives her a very impulsive and restless 192 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS nature. She has the mind to see where reforms are
needed, but the nature of her effort to carry out these
reforms depends upon her station in life, with which we
are not acquainted. If she had been born into a broad environment where wealth, position, and influence were
at her command, she would have been a powerful factor,
felt in a wide sphere; but if she were born in a financially
cramped environment, she would be correspondingly THE KIDNEYS 193 hampered by its circumstances. However, no matter
where she is her influence is bound to be felt, and she
will endeavor to revolutionize things, with the inevitable
result that she will wear herself out in her efforts for
improvement.
As a chain always breaks at the point where the
weakest link is found, so it is also with the human life.
Uranus, the planet of spasmodic, uncontrolled action, is
in opposition to Mercury, the planet which governs the
cerebrospinal system, showing that there will be a
nervous breakdown whenever great strain is put upon the
body. Saturn, the planet of obstruction, is in conjunction
with the Moon in the sign that governs the heart, Leo,
and it is square to the Sun, ruler of Leo. Thus it is
evident that the heart action is very poor and there is an
inability to specialize the vital force from the Sun, also a
poor circulation. In fact, the chart shows the possibility
of a condition which can only be described as a general
breakdown from overwork and nervous tension,
affecting every organ in the body—for Uranus and Mars
in Libra will interfere with the action of the kidneys, the
Sun afflicted in Taurus will act upon the throat, and the
rectal elimination, governed by Scorpio, will be
interfered with. This condition has finally materialized.
It is almost needless to say that in such a case as this,
absolute rest, mental and physical, is necessary,
preferably on a diet of fruits, for it is very detrimental to
force food into a system that is in such a shape as this
one. An Aquarian nurse whose Saturn is not in Libra or 194 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Pisces would have a quieting and beneficial influence.
But even though relief is given and a cure effected,
persons with this nature and temperament are bound to
work themselves to death some time sooner or later.
Nothing that one can say or do to educate them to the
fact that they should take things quietly in order that they
may last will have any effect, for the spasmodic urge of
Uranus and the dynamic energy of Mars on the
Ascendant will outweigh any consideration because
there are cardinal signs on the angles. This woman is
bound to work, even if she knew that she would drop
dead the next minute. There is no doubt, however, that
she is bound to benefit very much in soul growth, even if
the body is destroyed in the process. THE KIDNEYS 195 NO. 7D—RENAL CALCULI
Male, born September 21, 1863, noon. I N this horoscope Saturn is in conjunction with
Mars and Venus. Neptune is in opposition to all
three, and the Moon is square Saturn and Venus. Mars,
the planet of impulse, causes the native to see red on the
slightest provocation, and were he left alone there would
be absolutely no chance of restraining him, save by
putting him in a straightjacket, particularly as the Sun is
square Uranus, which would intensify the impulsiveness
and obliterate reason. But the saturnine ray is sufficiently
effectual to wet-blanket most of the erratic tendencies,
for he is in the sign of his exaltation, Libra, and highly
elevated.
Mercury in conjunction with Jupiter, both elevated
and in trine to Uranus, shows us that there is a
wholesome, kindly, and religious side to the mind. From
Mars comes the readiness to take offense, even where no
reasonable ground for it exists. Saturn will cause the
native to brood over injuries, whether they be real or
fancied; but Jupiter will endeavor to instill charity and
judgment. It is apparent, however, that the forces which
tend to accentuate the evil side of the nature are the
strongest and that it is a hard and uphill fight for the
higher nature.
Saturn in the first part of Libra, the sign ruling the
kidneys, acts in such a manner that the secretion of urine 196 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS is obstructed. Mars there causes inflammation. The
conjunction of Saturn with Venus, the latter governing
the venous circulation, reveals the fact that the branch of
the portal system which conducts the blood from the kidneys is obstructed, and the square of Saturn to the
Moon diminishes the amount of urine secreted. Neptune
in opposition to Saturn shows clearly a mental cause,
irritability and worry, interfering with nerve action. Thus THE KIDNEYS 197 renal calculi are formed, and the person is subject to one
of the most painful maladies imaginable.
To help a person of this nature we must invoke the
aid of Jupiter and Mercury trine Uranus. Mars is the
great energizer that impels to action, but Saturn in
conjunction puts a damper on him, and the native
becomes indolent, averse to the exercise generally
enjoyed by the Sagittarians. We must therefore wake the
native up to the urgent necessity for exercise, and plenty
of it. The Moon in Capricorn acts in the opposite sign,
Cancer, ruling the stomach, and because it squares
Saturn in Libra, the sign of the kidneys, it interferes with
the secretion of urine. Hence the necessity for the
regulation of the diet. Nothing of an irritating or unduly
stimulating nature should be eaten.
The best healer for this person would be one who has
Leo rising, as that is in harmony with Sagittarius. Aries
is second choice for the reason that an Arian may be too
rough and arouse antagonism without so intending.
Neither should have Saturn in Sagittarius or Taurus,
these being on the cusps of the patient's first and sixth
houses respectively. 198 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 7E—RENAL CIRCULATION
Female, born March 24, 1845, 5:06 A.M. I N judging the case presented in this horoscope our
first care, as usual, is to find out what sort of
mental quality this person has, for always we must
remember that the mind is the maker of the body.
Therefore the wisest doctors now use harmless pills and
helpful suggestions.
Mercury and the Moon, the two particular
significators in respect to mind, are in opposition. The
Moon is also in opposition to the Sun, Jupiter, and
Uranus. Mars is square to the Sun, Moon, Jupiter,
Mercury, and Uranus. Thus the person is extremely
erratic, vacillating, and torn between different purposes.
There is only one redeeming feature, namely, Saturn
trine the Moon and sextile Jupiter. Were it not for these
aspects, which steady the mind, the native would likely
have gone insane. Take now, in conjunction with the
foregoing remarks, the fact that four common signs are
on the angles and you will understand that she is
extremely difficult to handle mentally. She is one of
those unfortunate weaklings afflicted with a wishbone
instead of a backbone. The Sun square Mars makes her
impulsive, also the adverse aspects from cardinal signs
give a certain surplus energy which manifests as
impulse. But she lacks the persistence to carry out her
impetuous designs. THE KIDNEYS 199 The affliction of Jupiter indicates faulty circulation,
and naturally we judge the presence of Saturn in
Aquarius as an indication of obstruction in that place, for
the diseases to which the human body is heir are found in
the weakest spot, and Saturn usually marks this. Aquarius governs the lower limbs, and the presence of
Saturn there shows us that the obstruction of the
circulation is at work in that region. Moreover, Mars has
progressed to the conjunction of Saturn in Aquarius, and 200 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS both are in the twelfth house, the house which indicates
confinement. Therefore we may judge that the person is
afflicted with a severe case of impeded circulation, and it
is no surprise to learn that her legs are numb and cold,
that she cannot use them properly, and that she is
confined to her bed on that account.
The Moon in Libra, which rules the kidneys, and her
opposition to Jupiter shows that the renal circulation is
out of order, and the presence of so many planets in
Aries, which governs the head, is a sure indication that
there is a riot of conflicting forces there. Thus, because
of the afflictions of these planets, we have a case of
sleeplessness, extreme nervousness, and the irritability
given by Uranus. The blood runs riot in the upper part of
the body, and there is too little in the lower.
As that native is well along in years there is not
much to build upon, but an effort should nevertheless be
made to stimulate the kidneys. The secretion of urine is
often totally stopped by the opposition of Uranus,
Mercury, and Jupiter to the Moon in Libra. This leaves
deposits of poison in the system, and as long as these are
not eliminated the person will be weighted down by a
heavy and sluggish feeling which makes the body seem
as if it were made of lead. Great care should be taken to
soothe and calm this woman as every bit of anger or
irritability makes elimination more difficult and causes
more poison to collect in the system. A healer who has
Scorpio rising and who does not have Saturn in
Aquarius, Pisces, or Leo would have a beneficial effect. THE KIDNEYS 201 NO. 7F—BLADDER TROUBLE
Female, born October 21, 1886, 11:00 A.M. W HEN we note that the Moon and Mercury,
which are significators of the mind, are
squaring each other from fixed signs, it is at once evident
that this patient will be rather set in her opinions and on
that account difficult to handle. A person with Leo or
Aries rising, whose Saturn is not in Gemini, would
probably have the best success in making her obey
orders. Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in Cancer, the
sign which rules the stomach, shows that the digestion is
poor, and his square to the Sun, Jupiter, and Venus
placed in the sign Libra, which rules the kidneys,
indicates that there is difficulty in the removal of the
waste material through these organs. The Sun being
close to the cusp of Scorpio, the sign which rules the
rectum, further accentuates the trouble of elimination,
showing that the person is subject to constipation.
It should be noted that when the significator of
bladder trouble is in the fore part of the sign Libra, the
difficulty will usually be found in the kidneys
themselves, but if in the latter part of Libra, the bladder
will be affected. Thus, following out this line of
judgment, we may know that as of the Sun is in 28
degrees of Libra, the trouble will be found more in the
bladder than in the kidneys. The square of the Moon to
Mercury in Scorpio shows that there is nervous trouble 202 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS in the rectal region. Altogether the various signs and
aspects which we have enumerated show that this person
is suffering from constipation and bladder trouble. This is not all. We find Mars, the planet of surgery,
conjunction Antares. When one of the malefics is placed
near the nebulous spot Antares, Sagittarius 8°, and either
of the lights are afflicted, trouble with the eyes is quite
certain to result. In this horoscope both the Sun and THE KIDNEYS 203 Moon are afflicted, one by a square of Saturn, the other
by a square of Mercury. We may therefore judge that this
woman will have trouble with her eyes, and as Mars is
placed in the twelfth house, which rules confinement in
hospitals or kindred places, it is evident that she is facing
a grave danger from that source.
It is also plain from the horoscope that Saturn in
Cancer is at the root of all the trouble by obstructing the
digestion, and if we can once convince the patient that
right living is the key to health, it may not be too late to
restore the tone of the system. It will probably be very
difficult to so convince her on account of her fixed
mental attitude, indicated by the square of the Moon and
Mercury in fixed signs.
A diet of coarse food, consisting of whole wheat
bread and vegetables, which have a great deal of fiber in
them, will be necessary to stimulate the peristaltic action
of the bowels. Asparagus and other foods which act on
the kidneys, with plenty of lettuce and spinach, which
are full of iron, will help to tone the system up so that in
time elimination will become normal and then the eyes
will grow better. 204 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 7G—DIABETES
Female, born December 28, 1885, 11:55 Plutão .M. T HE patient in this case is suffering from
diabetes, a disease in which the food is turned to
sugar in excess of the requirements of the body, and this
product is eliminated in the urine. Here we find Jupiter
on the Ascendant in the sign Libra, which governs the
kidneys, conjunction and parallel Uranus, and square the
Sun and Saturn, the latter in the sign Cancer, which rules
the stomach. We also find that the Sun is square the
Moon in Libra, and parallel and opposition Saturn. Thus
it is very evident that the stomach and kidneys are the
weakest links in the chain of the body, and therefore we
may look for disease in these organs.
Jupiter afflicted and on the Ascendant denotes one
who is too fond of good things to eat—a glutton. The
conjunction with Uranus tells us that this person is not
satisfied with quantity alone but desires her food to be
superfine in quality and to be excessively seasoned.
Saturn, the planet of obstruction, being in Cancer, the
sign governing the stomach, interferes with digestion.
Consequently the food cannot be entirely assimilated,
and some of it must be expurgated from the system or it
will cause a clogged and poisoned condition. Jupiter has
rule over the liver, where the sugar usually required in
the economy of the body is manufactured, but he is
sorely afflicted by a square of Saturn and the Sun. THE KIDNEYS 205 Consequently this activity is abnormal, and as Jupiter is
placed in the sign of the kidneys, Libra, he allows the
sugar to slip out in the urine, thus giving rise to the
symptoms which we diagnose as diabetes. There is also a
throat affliction because Neptune is in Taurus, the sign
that governs the throat, afflicting Venus, the ruler of
Taurus. When we look to the inner causes of this disease in
our endeavor to find a remedy, we note that Saturn is 206 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS elevated and afflicting the Sun and Jupiter. This makes
the person morose and irritable, given to looking upon
the dark side of life and to finding fault with everything
and everybody. The ductless glands are centers of
important spiritual activity. An afflicted Neptune in
Taurus and an afflicted Uranus in Libra interfere with the
activities of the thyroid gland and the adrenals.
Before such a person can be really cured she must
experience some kind of a shock or be taken into an
entirely new environment and more cheerful
surroundings. A healer with Gemini or Aquarius rising,
whose Saturn is not in Pisces, would probably have the
most beneficial effect. THE KIDNEYS 207 NO. 7H—DIABETES
Female, born February 24, 1863, at Mercúrio :50 Plutão .M. T HE horoscope of this woman has the sign of
Libra on the Ascendant, with cardinal signs on
the four angles, and Leo intercepted in the 10th house.
These are all signs of strong feeling. The cardinal signs
are the favorites of the universe, for the Sun's entrance
into these four signs marks the four seasons. People with
the cardinal signs on the angles feel more keenly, live
more intensely, and as a result suffer more than others.
The ascending sign of our patient is that of Libra,
with Jupiter retrograde on the Ascendant. Jupiter is
parallel to the Sun, but its being retrograde naturally
weakens the effects of this planet. We find Jupiter in the
latter degrees of Libra, a Venusian sign, and Venus and
the Sun in the Jupiterian sign of Pisces. Usually under
such conditions the body takes on an abundance of flesh
after middle life. This woman was of immense size,
weighing over two hundred pounds, which is indicated
by the above positions, also by Jupiter on the Ascendant
and Mars in Taurus sextile to Venus in Pisces. Venus
being in the fifth house, this woman found great pleasure
in good things to eat and wanted her food in large
quantities. This naturally caused her to put on much
flesh.
Neptune, the planet of mysteries, representing
hidden or occult things, is in Aries in the 6th house, 208 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS sextile to the Moon. The 6th house rules labor and the
10th house the vocation. The Moon is the ruler of the
10th house, and together with Neptune indicates the
vocation which this woman would choose. It is thus
clearly indicated that she was a professional medium. She was reported to be a very good one, which is shown
by the Moon sextile to Neptune and trine to Saturn, the
6th, 8th, and 12th houses being involved. Uranus being THE KIDNEYS 209 trine to Mercury, she would seek reasons for
spiritualistic phenomena, also because Mercury is in the
intellectual sign of Aquarius. Uranus is in the mercurial
sign of Gemini, a sign of intellectuality, and Uranus and
Mercury are therefore in mutual reception, which is
conducive to much sympathy between these two planets.
What is meant by “mutual reception” is that these planets
have exchanged signs—Uranus is in Mercury's sign, and
Mercury is in the Uranian sign. These two planets as a
result have a strong influence on the life of the native.
This woman conducted classes in spiritualism and gave
spiritualistic readings.
We find Venus and the Sun in Pisces in the 5th
house, the house of pleasure. Venus is sextile to Mars
and has a weak square to Uranus. This was clearly
expressed in the woman's life, for she lived with a man
whom she introduced as her husband but to whom she
had never been married. This man was represented by
the Sun and Venus in Pisces and by Venus sextile to
Mars and in weak square to Uranus. The man was large,
red-haired, and fond of drink. He depended upon this
woman entirely for his support, and they both lived to
eat, and to make merry upon the money which she
earned as a medium. This kind of a life may do for a
while, but there comes a time when nature rebels, when
the vital organs refuse to stand the strain any longer, as
in this case.
When the progressed Venus reached a conjunction
with Mars in Taurus and the progressed Moon was in 210 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Aquarius, making a square to Mars radical and to Venus
progressed, the strain which the woman had placed on
her body by her riotous living found a weak spot in the
kidneys, for the chain is only as strong as its weakest
link. Saturn usually shows the spot where the weakness
is apt to show itself. We find in this case Saturn in Libra,
in opposition and parallel to Neptune. This woman called
upon headquarters when she was suffering very greatly
from diabetes. It was, however, very difficult for her to
follow the diet laid down for her as she was accustomed
to the richest foods, which were taken in large quantities. CHAPTER XIX
SEX
SEX AND THROAT
NO. 8A—B W E are told in The Rosicrucian CosmoConception, page 269, that when the Ego
entered into possession of its vehicles, it became
necessary to use part of the creative force for the
building of the brain and the larynx. The latter was
originally a part of the sex organ. The larynx was built
while the dense body was yet bent together in the baglike shape which is still the form of the human embryo.
As the dense body straightened and became upright, part
of the creative organ remained with the upper part of the
dense body and later became the larynx.
It is always possible to make the lesson stronger by
using two horoscopes. In this case we will begin with the
horoscope numbered 8A, which is that of man born April
22nd, 1881, at 2 Plutão .M.
The common sign of Virgo is on the Ascendant and
common signs on all the angles. In this horoscope we
will show the law of the vicious circle, which the doctors
are so interested in and which is so baffling, and how 211 212 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS this law proves the truth of the statement quoted from the
Cosmo-Conception. We have Saturn, the Sun, and Jupiter in conjunction,
and Saturn and Jupiter are parallel to the Moon. Neptune
is in conjunction with Venus and both are square the
Moon. All these planets except the Moon are in Taurus,
the sign which has rule over the throat.
We find the planet of impulse, Uranus, retrograde on
the Ascendant in Virgo and in opposition to Mars. These SEX 213 planets are in common signs and in angles. Thus they are
strong by house position but placed in weak-willed signs.
Uranus and Mars give the desire for pleasure and the
gratification of the senses. Mars is sextile to Venus and Neptune in Taurus, a sign which makes one apt to drift
along the same path, Taurus ruling the sense of taste.
Neptune and Venus in Taurus, square to the Moon in
Aquarius, would lead to the habit of drink and also to 214 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS irregular association with women friends, for the Moon
is the ruler of the house of friends, the 11th.
We find no planets in Scorpio, the sign which rules
the generative organs, but Uranus afflicted by Mars gives
a tendency to venereal diseases. Syphilis was the net
result. Therefore we may see that Taurus, which rules the
throat and larynx, here expresses itself through the
opposite point of the vicious circle of the fixed signs,
namely Scorpio, ruler of the generative organs. The
Moon in Aquarius, the third point of the circle, is also a
contributing factor in the situation.
In the second case we will use a plain figure, as the
hour of birth is lacking. This is the horoscope, numbered
8B, of a woman born November 12th, 1895.
In this figure we find Mercury, Mars, Saturn, the
Sun, and Uranus all in the sign of Scorpio, which has
rule over the generative organs, with Saturn and Mars in
conjunction and square to Jupiter. The Sun and Uranus
are also in conjunction with each other and the Sun is
parallel to Jupiter.
This woman had her tonsils removed at puberty. The
tonsils are ruled by Taurus. Due to Mars in conjunction
with Saturn, and the Sun in conjunction with Uranus in
the sign of Scorpio, she unfortunately yielded to the
vicious practice of abortion, which so weakened the
functions of the generative organs that removal of the
ovarian tubes was necessary. Here again we see the
vicious circle of the fixed signs in operation—Taurus
and Scorpio being the points affected. SEX 215 We may see by comparison of these two horoscopes
how the generative organs and the throat are closely in
sympathy with each other and that abuses of the function
of one of them often express themselves through
impaired functioning of the opposite organ. NO. 8C—SEX
Female, born November 24, 1909, hour of birth not
known. W E will here illustrate how it is possible to
diagnose a disease correctly from a flat figure.
It is, however, impossible to predict the exact time of
crises or to judge the strength of the will of the patient,
for those with a common sign on the Ascendant
sometimes become hopeless invalids if planetary aspects
are also weak; while one with fixed signs on the angles
(especially with the vital Sun sign Leo ascending), even
if the planets are weak, will often, through the
determination and will power of the fixed signs,
overcome adverse conditions. The Taureans, however,
although under a fixed sign, sometimes allow fear to
throw them into a chronic condition of ill health which 216 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS with the fixed and stolid nature of this sign it is very
difficult to overcome.
In this lesson we shall deal largely with the ductless
glands, upon which science has spent so much time,
though it has been unable as yet to arrive at a full
understanding of these little organs. We will deal
particularly with the thyroid gland, which is under the SEX 217 rule of Mercury and in which science is greatly
interested, the thyroid glands of goats and monkeys
having been grafted into men to rejuvenate them.
In the above horoscope we find Saturn, the planet of
obstruction and crystallization and ruler of the
pneumogastric nerve, in conjunction with the Moon,
which rules the uterus, ovaries, and sympathetic nervous
system. Venus, the planet ruling the sign of Taurus, the
throat, also rules the thymus gland, the organ through
which the child receives the parental blood necessary to
build the body. This gland has especially to do with the
development of the reproductive organs. At puberty the
thymus gland atrophies, and its work is then continued
by the pituitary body, ruled by Uranus, which is the
higher octave of Venus. In this girl's horoscope we find
the planets Venus and Uranus in conjunction, square to
Saturn and the Moon, and in opposition to the planet
Neptune, which has rule over the pineal gland and which
is the higher octave of Mercury. Scientists have observed
that the pineal gland has some connection with the mind.
Dr. J. S. Lankford stated in The New York Medical
Journal some time ago that “the pineal gland, which is at
the base of the brain, is a partly glandular and partly
nervous structure, and is known to be the center of all
sensation and emotion; at the same time it rules and
directs all the activities of the whole system of ductless
glands and the vegetative nervous system, thereby
governing all the functions of organic life. It also serves 218 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS as a communicating center between the brain and the
other organs.”
Now, where we find the planets which have rule
over the nervous system and the brain in square and
opposition, what can we expect but that abuse of one
kind or another will cause bodily disturbance! In the case
of this young girl, whose guardians called upon our
Healing Department for help, she had for some years
been afflicted with the secret sex habit, of which the
guardians were unaware until apprised through our
diagnosis. The venous circulation is obstructed by the
conjunction of Venus and Uranus. The latter planet,
according to The Message of the Stars (page 573), “is
responsible for strange and abnormal growths which
produce...freaks of nature.” The thymus gland in this
case has an abnormal growth caused by the conjunction
of Venus with Uranus, which created too much blood for
the development of the generative organs in childhood.
This in turn created a disturbance in the parts of the body
ruled by this gland.
We are told by the doctors that the pineal gland
(under Neptune) rules and directs all the ductless glands.
Max Heindel has been alone in his claim that Neptune is
the higher octave of Mercury, the latter planet having
rule over the thyroid gland. Other astrologers have
claimed that Neptune is the higher octave of Venus. But
science corroborates our contention that the pineal gland
has rule over the mentality. The Cosmo-Conception
states that this was at first an organ of sensation and SEX 219 orientation, and that when it began to withdraw into the
head, the division of the sexes began to take place and
the brain and larynx were developed.
Dr. Lankford further states that the large amount of
sugar consumed by humanity overdevelops and
overstimulates the pineal gland. The truth of this has
been shown in our experience with cases in which
Neptune was afflicted and especially where the
afflictions were such that the patient had to overcome
unnatural sex desires. These patients invariably were
heavy sugar eaters. Sugar in excess, as well as liquor, is
a false stimulant and excites the ductless glands, which
when overstimulated are responsible for sex degeneracy.
This young girl by years of abuse had dissipated the vital
fluids that were necessary to help build the brain, and
consequently at the age of eleven she was afflicted with
epilepsy, which is a disease caused by abnormality of
one of the ductless glands. The doctors could not find the
cause and wished to remove the tonsils. When there is an
abnormal exercise of the sex function or unexpressed
unnatural desires, the throat, and especially the tonsils
and the larynx, are often enlarged and swollen. Oh, what
a pity that all surgeons and the doctors of all schools do
not have a knowledge of diagnosis by the wonderful
science of astrology to combine with their own science!
In order to help a case such as the one under
consideration it is first necessary to remove the cause,
which is to help this poor girl overcome her unnatural
desires. The diet must be changed. All highly seasoned 220 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS food, condiments, eggs, and especially sugar, must be
eliminated, and the vegetables which contain elements
that work directly upon the nervous system should be
used, such as celery, onions, parsley, lettuce, etc. This
body should be kept clean by bathing and dry rubbing,
and plenty of exercise in the fresh air and sunshine
should be taken. It will be difficult at the girl's present
age to build up the brain, which is very undeveloped.
Young people who have dissipated their vital fluids
between the ages of seven and fourteen, when the
creative force should be used for the development of the
brain, will seldom be very bright mentally. The physical
body, however, can be built up, and if the habit is
overcome before the age of twenty-one, there is hope
that by careful living the brain can be developed, giving
an average mentality. SEX 221 NO. 8D, 8E—GONORRHEA
Female, born July 30, 1896, hour not known. T WO horoscopes will be used in this lesson in an
endeavor to illustrate how the planets show
when disease may be the result of breaking the laws of
nature in former lives, and how the seeds that have been
sown by past sins will bring their fruits in this life.
The first horoscope is that of a woman whose hour
of birth is not known. Nor is it necessary for diagnosis in
a horoscope with planets so strangely grouped and in the
fixed signs. We will set the figure with Aries on the
Ascendant. We find Mercury, Sun, Venus, Jupiter, and
the Dragon's Tail all in the fifth sign, Leo, which
represents the pleasures of the native. We find Mars in
Taurus in its detriment, the sign in which this planet of
dynamic energy shows its most evil tendencies. This
planet is afflicted by the opposition of the licentious
Uranus and the obstructive Saturn. These last named
planets are in conjunction and in the fixed sign of
Scorpio. These three malefic planets, Mars, Uranus, and
Saturn are also square to the planets in Leo.
Here we find a very heavy debt of destiny. In the
Rosicrucian teachings we are told that we lay the
foundation in this life upon which we shall build the
structure of future lives. This woman in her previous life
had developed a very powerful desire nature, which in
this embodiment was very hard to keep under control. 222 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Venus in conjunction with the Sun and Jupiter and
square to Uranus and Saturn in the sign of Scorpio, also
Mars, the planet which has rule over the desires, square
to Venus and Jupiter, all lead to free love and clandestine
attachments, with the result that this poor woman has
contracted that dread disease, gonorrhea, which has
resulted in tuberculosis of the pelvic and hip bones. Now planets impel but they do not compel. This
woman by her former living had attracted to herself these SEX 223 planetary afflictions, but she was not impelled to respond
to their weakness, for we find the Moon well-aspected,
making a sextile to Neptune and a trine to Jupiter,
Venus, Sun, and Mercury. Neptune is also sextile to
Venus and Jupiter. If the woman had used her will and
followed the desire to live right, which naturally must
have come to her from time to time, she could have
transmuted this seeming evil into good. But the path of
sensual pleasure was so much broader and so alluring,
while the upward path meant self-surrender! NO. 8E Male, born August 13, 1920, 1:18 A.M.
The second horoscope is that of a young boy born
with the dread disease with which the woman in case No.
8D was afflicted. The boy's poor little body at birth was
covered with sores, and in the early part of November of
the birth year this poor soul passed out under great
suffering. 224 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Now as regards the man who does not understand
and believe in rebirth and the law of consequence this
last case would be apt to disturb his faith in God, who to
him might appear cruel and unjust to have visited this
suffering upon an innocent babe. But when the occultist
who has a knowledge of astrology seeks an answer to this seeming injustice, he finds Uranus in Pisces, the
12th house sign of self-undoing, near the Midheaven and SEX 225 in opposition to Saturn, which is in the 4th house. These
two planets represent the parents and show that this soul
had sinned in its previous lives in such a manner as to be
attracted to parents who were afflicted with the above
disease.
We also find Mars in the sign of Scorpio, square to
Neptune, Sun, and Moon, which are in the fixed sign of
Leo, the natural 5th house sign of pleasure. This soul had
passed out of its former embodiment in a manner very
similar to that of the woman with the first horoscope.
The parents were only the instruments through which it
received its lesson.
How strangely the threads of life cross one another,
weaving in and out with the threads of other persons'
lives we have wronged, and who then must be the means
through which we learn our lessons.
The mills of God grind slowly,
But they grind exceeding small. 226 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 8F—VENEREAL DISEASE
Male, born April 5, 1896, Júpiter :00 A.M. Plutão ISCES, a watery and negative sign, is on the
Ascendant, and the ruler, Jupiter, is in another
watery sign, Cancer, 29°18’. Planets that are in the last
three degrees of a sign are not as helpful and active as
when they are less advanced in the sign. They act in the
same manner as a ball thrown with force; by the time it
reaches its destination it has to some extent lost its speed,
and the greater the distance it travels the less its force. So
we find that planets situated in the last three degrees of a
sign partake partly of the sign in which they are placed
and also of the one following, giving a mixed vibration;
therefore they express the nature of two signs. In this
horoscope Jupiter is in the 5th house of pleasures and
trine to Mercury, the planet of reason, which is in the
impulsive and martial sign of Aries. The Moon, the ruler
of the 5th house, is in the 11th house, ruling friends, in
the sign of its fall, Capricorn, and in sextile to the planet
of love and pleasure, Venus. When this last-named
planet is on the Ascendant the native is very apt to drift
into the pleasure-loving path, the path of the senses. He
is easily influenced by attention and flattery from the
opposite sex. In this case, the Moon, a feminine planet,
in the house of friends, indicates that this young man's
women friends will have the strongest influence in his SEX 227 life. Venus, another feminine planet, on the Ascendant,
afflicted by a square of Neptune, the co-ruler of the
Ascendant and the higher octave of Mercury, situated in
the mercurial sign of Gemini in the 4th house, indicates that his women friends will lead him into paths of the
senses and may destroy his love for the home, for Venus
is also trine to the restless and romantic Uranus and the
materialistic Saturn. These last named planets are 228 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS retrograde and in the martial sign of Scorpio, governing
sex. Mars, the planet of passion, is in the fixed sign of
Aquarius, in the 12th house, that of self-undoing, and in
square aspect to Uranus and Saturn. Saturn and Mars are
in mutual reception strengthening the good or evil of
these planets.
What do we find? It happens that this poor young
man's weakness and love for women have attracted
licentious and free-love companions, and the result is
venereal disease, which has poisoned the blood. And
with Venus, the planet ruling the venous circulation, on
the Ascendant and afflicted by the watery planet Neptune
in the sign of the lungs, Gemini, quick consumption is
the result.
In February, 1919, the progressed Moon reached the
conjunction of the radical Saturn, which brought on the
lung disease. In July, five months later, when the man
called upon Headquarters for healing, he was already in
an advanced stage of galloping consumption. The
following month, August, the Moon made a square to the
inflammatory Mars, which brought on hemorrhages.
Here we can see the influences of the planets, their
causes and effects. The relatives of this young man did
not understand why he should have contracted this
disease of the lungs which worked so rapidly and was so
destructive. With the affliction from watery signs, the
soil was well prepared for the seeds which were sown
through dissipation and thoughtlessness. SEX 229 A case of this kind is very difficult to heal, for with
the negative Pisces on the Ascendant, and Saturn and
Uranus, the planets indicating impulse, yes, even
stubbornness, in conjunction in Scorpio and square to
Mars, all in fixed signs, it is very hard to guide such a
person into safe channels. And we find both the lights
afflicted, the Moon in the saturnine sign of Capricorn,
showing determination and stubbornness, square to the
Sun in the impulsive sign of Mars. Hence this young
man would not listen to reason. He would do as he
pleased regardless of caution and advice. A life in the
open air with careful diet and pure surroundings would
be the only cure. If he would listen to reason and adopt it
he might get well. 230 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 8G—VENEREAL DISEASE
Male, born October 6, 1895. L EO is on the Ascendant, and Jupiter is just
above the cusp of the first house, making a
square aspect to Saturn and Mercury in the sign of
Scorpio. The Moon in Taurus, its exaltation sign, is in
the 10th house and in opposition to Uranus, which is also
posited in its exaltation sign, Scorpio, ruling the
generative organs. The Moon so strongly situated will
have the greatest influence over the young man's life and
health. Being in opposition to the licentious Uranus, it
will make him very free and unconventional in his love
affairs, and he will be attracted to women of a low type.
With the afflicted Jupiter ruling the arterial blood, and
with Neptune in Gemini in the 11th house, the house of
friends, in square aspect to Venus, which has rule over
the venous blood, this young man is apt to be led into
association with undesirable women friends. As a matter
of fact they are responsible for his contracting a severe
case of syphilis which poisoned the blood.
In 1914 we find the progressed Sun in the first
degree of Scorpio, and the progressed Moon in the sign
Aquarius, forming an opposition to the Ascendant and
the radical Jupiter in Leo. It is also coming up to a square
of the radical Saturn, Mercury, and Uranus in Scorpio. In
this same year two new moons afflicted the three latter
planets. The one on January 26th fell in five degrees of SEX 231 Aquarius in opposition to Jupiter and square to Saturn
and Mercury. On April 25th the new Moon fell in four
degrees of Taurus, square to Jupiter and opposition
Saturn and Mercury. This was the time when the
venereal disease was contracted. In 1918 the Sun by progression formed a square to
the radical Jupiter in Leo, and in 1919 a conjunction with
Saturn in Scorpio. In the latter year, however, the 232 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS progressed Moon trined the Ascendant, and on May 29,
1919, an eclipse of the Sun in seven degrees of Gemini
sextiled the Ascendant. These vibrations no doubt saved
the young man's life during the adverse aspects of the
progressed Sun.
In 1921 the progressed Sun came into conjunction
with the radical Mercury. On April 22nd the full Moon
eclipse fell in two degrees of Scorpio opposing the
transiting Sun and Venus. At the same time the transiting
Mars was within orb of a conjunction with the radical
Moon and in opposition to Uranus. In the spring of that
year the young man submitted to an operation for an
abscess under the diaphragm, which after being opened
was a very long time in discharging, necessitating a drain
tube. The doctors claimed that the pus was from the
lungs, but the patient denied ever having had trouble
with these organs. The horoscope shows, however, that
the doctors' diagnosis was correct, for Neptune in
Gemini, ruling the lungs, afflicted by a square of Venus
from the common and earthy sign of Virgo, would
obstruct the delivery of the venous blood to the lungs,
causing poor oxygenation. With the blood stream
polluted by the dread disease of syphilis and with both
the arterial blood (ruled by Jupiter) and the venous blood
(ruled by Venus) obstructed, the weakest organ, the
lungs, would naturally receive the poison generated in
the blood.
After the patient had somewhat recovered from the
operation he returned home. On April 25th, he was taken SEX 233 back to the hospital (that was three days after the total
eclipse of the Moon in Scorpio) with what at first was
termed a case of mumps. The throat, jaw, and larynx
were very much swollen and inflamed. This condition
was later diagnosed by some of the doctors as
actinomycosis, an infectious, chronic disease of cattle,
sometimes transferred to man. But there was a difference
of opinion among the doctors. Some held that the disease
was cancer.
As the Moon is the most heavily afflicted planet in
the natal chart, naturally when by progression in 1922 it
reached the opposition of the radical Saturn and Mercury
and the square to Jupiter from the 10th house and the
sign of Taurus, the disease reached a stage where the
body could no longer rid itself of the poisons which had
been stored up during eight years. There were two new
moons in 1922 which helped to bring about the crisis. On
January 27th the new Moon fell in Aquarius, seven
degrees and eighteen minutes, opposing the radical
Jupiter and square to the radical Saturn and Mercury. On
April 27th the new Moon fell in six degrees and nine
minutes of Taurus, square to Jupiter and in opposition to
Saturn and Mercury. All these afflictions were from or
reacted upon the signs of Taurus and Scorpio. The
tonsils, the larynx, and the throat therefore received
much of the pus generated in the body. The result was
death.
Had this young man, after he contracted the disease,
lived a life of abstinence from rich foods, tobacco, meat, 234 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS liquor, etc., he might have overcome it and perhaps have
lived for a number of years. But the poisons which were
lodged principally in the lungs were increased by more
impurities generated through ignorance of diet. NO. 8H—UTERINE TROUBLE
Female, born July 29, 1881, 6:00 Plutão .M. C APRICORN, the Saturnian sign of the cardinal
quadruplicity, is on the Ascendant, and the
ruler, Saturn, is in the 4th house, that of the home, in the
determined, stubborn, persistent sign of Taurus, making
a square to the life-giving Sun, in the fixed sign of Leo
ruling the heart. This has a tendency to obstruct the life
forces. The vitality is low, the heart action sluggish,
especially as we find Jupiter, the planet ruling the arterial
circulation, afflicted by the conjunction of the fiery
Mars. This is a latent condition which will give the
native much greater trouble after she has reached the
period of menopause. Her restricted heart action will
then be more troublesome than before.
When she called upon Headquarters for healing in
the early part of 1914, the progressed Moon had reached
the opposition to the afflicted planets in the 4th house in
Taurus. The doctor who had been treating her for catarrh SEX 235 of the stomach and nervousness failed to benefit her. She
was very skeptical and did not believe in spiritual
healing, but friends who had been healed by the Invisible
Helpers persuaded her to write to Headquarters for diagnosis. She did not ask for healing, but only wanted
to know what was the matter with her physically, stating
that the doctor could not understand the cause of her
general poor health. 236 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS In our diagnosis we told her that she had not
developed normally. With the obstructing Saturn
conjunction Neptune in the sign of the throat, trouble
was indicated at puberty, also restricted menses,
adenoids, and inflamed tonsils. This had a reflex action
in the opposite sign of Scorpio, which rules the
generative organs, showing that these organs had never
become fully developed. Neptune has this tendency
when afflicted, especially in the sign of Taurus or
Scorpio and in conjunction with or opposition to Saturn.
Then the generative organs are underdeveloped, and
childbirth becomes very severe and painful. This woman
had four children, and at each birth her life was
despaired of. The result was uterine trouble.
A tendency to catarrh of the small intestine is also
indicated, for we have the Moon, the ruler of the sign
Cancer, the stomach, placed in the sign Virgo, the small
intestines, conjunct the spasmodic Uranus, showing that
there was spasmodic action of the intestines and that the
food was not properly assimilated. This aspect also
interfered with the digestion of food in the stomach, as
the Moon is the ruler of that organ. This was aggravated
by a square of the Moon to Venus.
Uranus in conjunction with the ruler of the 7th
house, the Moon, shows inharmony in marriage. The
husband as indicated by this aspect is of a very nervous,
irritable nature, fond of drink (Venus square Moon). A
separation is shown. This woman acknowledged that she
has had trouble with her husband, that he had left her SEX 237 suddenly, and stated that she was compelled to support
her four children. One with Saturn, Neptune, Jupiter, and
Mars in Taurus afflicting one another has a tendency to
be critical and severe in the home, but at the same time
of a very frugal, hardworking nature, not saving oneself
but always working beyond one's physical strength.
Due to the conditions noted this woman had become
a broken-down, nervous wreck, with severe uterine
trouble and catarrh of the stomach and intestines. She
was not able to do a full day's work. Inside of two
months, however, through the aid of the Invisible
Helpers she was able to take a position, and she became
a healthy, happy woman. We advised a rational, careful
diet, eliminating all liquids with meals, for one with the
planetary conditions noted likes to drink a great deal
during meals. This is often dangerous to one with poor
assimilation, and where there is a lack of digestive fluids
in the stomach and intestines. 238 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 8I—CHILDBIRTH
Female, born June 3rd, 1884, Mercúrio :00 Plutão .M. I T is evident from the figure that the native is of a
very nervous, restless temperament, for Mercury,
the planet which rules the mind and the nerves, is in
conjunction with its higher octave, Neptune. This makes
her very high-strung. Then we find Saturn, the planet of
obstruction, conjoined with the life-giving Sun in the
mercurial sign Gemini. This diminishes the vital solar
life currents which feed the nerves, so that instead of
assimilating a great amount such as is necessary to feed
the nerves of a high-strung person, she gets less than the
normal amount and therefore is “on edge” and run down.
Add to this that Mars, the planet of passion, is square
Mercury, the planet of mind, which makes her temper
very short, and that the Moon, ruler of the imaginative
mind, is square Venus, the planet of love, and you will
understand that this person is very unhappy and always
out of patience with her condition and environment.
Her trouble is due to the aftereffects of childbirth.
The astrological figure gives a very good description of
the case. Mercury is conjunct Neptune in the fifth house,
which governs children, indicating an abnormal
condition. The planet of parturition, the Moon, is in
mutual reception with and square to Venus. Mars in the
eighth house, which indicates the manner of death, is
square to Mercury in the fifth house, ruling children, SEX 239 which shows the use of instruments, loss of blood, and a
great shock to the nervous system in childbirth. She must
have been near the door of death at that time. But while
Saturn conjunct the Sun saps the life forces, he also imparts a tenacity of life. Such people, unfortunately for
them, do not die quickly; they linger in their agony, an
almost unbearable burden to themselves and others who
must perforce live with them. No one is more to be 240 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS pitied. But the long years of invalidism, shown by Saturn
conjoined with the Sun in the sixth house, must be
necessary to impart to the soul some quality it lacks and
has refused to cultivate in other and easier ways,
otherwise our Father in Heaven would never have taken
such strenuous means to teach her the lesson.
From the healer's standpoint a case with Saturn and
the Sun conjoined in the sixth house is almost, if not
quite, hopeless, especially if there is a fixed sign on the
cusp, for the patient will be antagonistic, skeptical, and
recalcitrant to such an extent that he may more than
neutralize all efforts to aid nature in restoring harmony.
The principal work should be directed to cultivate in this
patient a right understanding of the spiritual cause of her
condition. If she can be brought to pray for light to see
the lesson and for a chance to correct her mistake,
whether in a past life or the present one, the changed
attitude of mind will cause a change in her condition so
that either a cure will be effected or a speedier release
found in death.
In the meantime such a person should be given food
that will supply ether to feed the nerves. Milk, warm and
fresh from the cow, has this in abundance, and so have
uncooked vegetables. Under the Law of Compatibility a
healer with Aries or Leo rising whose Saturn is not in
Gemini, would be best for this person. SEX 241 NO. 8J—ABORTION
Female, born February 7, 1866, 3:30 A.M. S AGITTARIUS is on the Ascendant in this chart.
On page 133 of The Message of the Stars it
states that this sign produces two distinct classes, the
high and lofty type which aims its arrow at the stars, and
the type which responds to the animal instincts and
indulges the animal desires. The latter type will not think
of the future. Like a child it will enjoy itself to the
fullest, living only from day to day, never laying aside
anything for a rainy day. Give such a person a million
dollars and he will become a pauper in spite of it. His
greatest enemies are his own appetites.
In the horoscope which we have under consideration
we find the ruler, Jupiter, in the sign of his fall,
Capricorn, in the first house. Jupiter is also conjunct the
fiery Mars in its exaltation sign of Capricorn. This gives
Mars greater power for evil than otherwise. Planets have
a reflex action and often affect the signs opposite them,
as in this case where the sign Cancer receives the effects
of Mars conjunct Jupiter. These planets denote bulk, and
when affecting the sign of Cancer the person is apt to
make a god of his stomach. His food must be of the very
best, rich and highly seasoned.
The ruler of Cancer, the Moon, is afflicted in the
fixed sign Scorpio (which has rule over the generative
organs) by a conjunction of Saturn and a square of This compilation © Phoenix E-Books UK 242 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Venus and the Sun. The Moon is the planet of
fertilization, of impregnation, and when found in the sign
of Scorpio in a woman's horoscope it is an indication that
she will be apt to have several children. But when the planet of obstruction, Saturn, is also in this sign and
afflicted, the organs of generation are sometimes
undersized, as in the case of this woman. During the
birth of her first and only child she was three days in SEX 243 labor, suffering greatly. This left her with a great fear of
childbirth, which led her to resort to abortion, the most
dangerous and vicious of practices. Due to the Moon in
Scorpio conception was frequent, and the native's great
fear caused her to employ means which destroyed the
fetus. In the eyes of God she became a murderess. The
continued abuse later developed into a most dangerous
case of blood poisoning, which left her broken in health,
a confirmed invalid.
Because of the rich food in which she had for years
indulged, her system was overcharged with poisons, and
since Venus, which has rule over the venous blood, and
Jupiter, the arterial, were both afflicted, all the impurities
were attracted to that part of the body where these
planets were located, Capricorn and Aquarius.
Sluggishness of the body is always found in the parts
corresponding to the signs in which Venus and Jupiter
are afflicted. There the ash is usually deposited. This
woman was unable to walk for five years before her
death, which occurred in February, 1920. We have not
been able to ascertain the exact day of her death. We find
the progressed Moon in February making a square to the
radical Venus. The progressed aspects alone, however,
would not cause death. We must look for the exciting
planets, the transits. The full Moon on February 4th fell
in 14 degrees and 16 minutes of Leo in opposition to the
radical Venus and Sun and square to the radical Saturn
and Moon. These aspects, we think, were responsible for
the native's demise. 244 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS How wonderfully accurate is diagnosis by the
planets! Each time this woman passed through a severe
illness, which was quite frequently, her relatives would
report that it was a case of peritonitis. We find, however,
no affliction to the small intestines, but very severe
afflictions to the generative organs. CHAPTER XX
THE SPINE
NO. 9A—SPINAL TROUBLE
Female, born June 21, 1899, 5:30 A.M. T HIS horoscope is the figure of a young woman
who is the daughter of wealthy parents, as
shown by the Sun, which is ruler of the second house,
trine to Jupiter. We will first consider the mental caliber,
as that is the prime consideration in dealing with anyone.
The Sun is in the twelfth house showing that the spirit in
a certain sense is imprisoned. The Sun is in conjunction
with the Dragon's Tail, which has a saturnine influence
and tends to further obstruct. These conditions rob life of
its joy and fill the soul with melancholy and fear, gloomy
forebodings, and thoughts of impending evil. Mars
square to the Moon, which is the life ruler, shows
rebellion against this condition. The square of Mars to
Venus, however, adds to the tendencies which rob life of
its satisfaction. The trine of the Sun to Jupiter and the
sextile of Mars to the Sun, Mercury, and Jupiter are 245 246 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS mitigating influences which give some light and life to
this poor soul's existence. The comforts procured
through the wealth of parents as indicated by these
aspects help to make life more tolerable than it would
otherwise be. With regard to the health denoted in this figure, we
find in the first place Cancer, a weak sign, on the
Ascendant. Four planets are posited in the twelfth house, THE SPINE 247 which in this case denotes confinement upon a sick bed.
Saturn, in the sixth house, which has to do with health, is
a sufficient indication that this will be a life of suffering.
Saturn, the principal significator in this respect, shows
that the ailments will be deep-seated and chronic. The
Moon, which is the peculiar significator of health in a
woman's horoscope, is within six degrees of the sixth
house cusp, adding its testimony in the same direction.
Mars square to the Moon near the sixth house renders the
native liable to operations. The Sun conjunction the
saturnine Dragon's Tail in the twelfth house makes such
operations exceedingly dangerous for she has not the
vitality wherewith to withstand and recuperate.
Moreover, the Sun in 1914 had progressed within orb of
a parallel to Saturn at birth. Thus the native had at that
time less vitality than she has had in earlier years. As the
Moon came into opposition to Saturn in the sixth house
in October, 1913, we may well conceive that the
condition at that time became critical.
Mars governs the muscles and the motor segment of
the spinal cord. He is square to the Moon, which governs
the sympathetic nerves, and also square to Uranus, which
causes spasmodic movements. Thus it is evident that the
nerves are affected and that the young lady has no
dependable control over her limbs. Neptune governs the
spinal canal, and it is opposite Saturn, the planet of
obstruction. This configuration occurs in the signs of
Gemini and Sagittarius, and in the sixth and the twelfth 248 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS houses. It is therefore evident that there is trouble in the
spine—obstruction, as denoted by Saturn.
The obstruction will be found in the region indicated
by the conjunction of Neptune, Sun, and Dragon's Tail in
24 to 29 of Gemini, namely, the dorsal region. The
doctors have been unable to diagnose this case, and sad
to say, it is incurable by any physical means. There is
only one method, namely, the dilation of the spinal canal
by repeated manipulations from within of the
materialized fingers of the Invisible Helpers. As the
young woman has not applied to us for healing, we are
sorry to say that we cannot touch her case; but were it
submitted to us, we should advise a healer having
Scorpio rising and with Saturn neither in Cancer nor in
Sagittarius, letting the healer put himself under the
direction of the Elder Brothers, who would then do the
work. THE SPINE 249 NO. 9B—SPINAL TROUBLE
Male, born February 1, 1918, at 12:30 A.M. W E have here the horoscope of a boy who has
fixed signs on all four angles and the martial
sign of Scorpio on the Ascendant. Our first thought when
looking at a horoscope for the diagnosis of disease is to
find if there is strength of will so that the patient will be
able to give the needed assistance to the healer, for if he
has persistence to fight for his life, if he will follow the
instructions given by the healer, then the healer has some
cooperation and the task is not so heavy. The task is
doubly hard, however, in the case of a patient who has
Saturn elevated in the 10th house, conjunction with
Midheaven, square the Ascendant, and with the stubborn
sign of Scorpio on the Ascendant. To effect a cure
against the stubborn will of such a patient might truly be
classed under the head of miracles.
As a rule we look to the strongest malefic planet
when diagnosing from the horoscope. Here we find the
obstructing and restricting Saturn in conjunction with the
Midheaven, also conjunction and parallel Neptune and in
opposition to the life-giving Sun. Saturn is in the sign of
the Sun, Leo, and the Sun is in Saturn's sign, Aquarius.
When planets are in mutual reception, i.e., have
exchanged signs, as we find Saturn and the Sun in this
horoscope, and especially when they are also in angles 250 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS and fixed signs, then we may expect a most stubborn and
deep-seated cause of disease. We are told on page 619 of The Message of the Stars
that Leo rules the spinal cord, and on page 566 of the
same book that Neptune rules the spinal canal. In this
horoscope we find 10 degrees of Leo occupying the cusp
of the 10th house and the life-giving Sun in opposition to
Neptune, Saturn, and the Midheaven. Can we find a THE SPINE 251 more pronounced affliction than this, especially with Leo
ruling the spinal column and Neptune the spinal canal,
the latter of which is filled with the spinal spirit fire, the
life of the Father?
When we find this spirit fire obstructed by Saturn
and the Sun, we may conclude that this affliction is the
result of serious wrongs committed in previous lives.
The wasting of the vital fluids, the abuse of the
generative faculty, is a sin against the Holy Ghost and
brings to the Ego the most severe punishment, as in the
case of this boy, who was drawn to parents who were fit
instruments to give him a body which would cause the
spirit to suffer for past sins. And what a pitiful future
faces him! He has never walked nor talked. He must be
fed, and he has positively no use of his body whatever.
The question may be asked, is there any hope for this
boy? Yes, to a certain degree. The planet of reason,
however, is weakly aspected by only a semi-sextile to
the Sun and Uranus: therefore we may expect little help
from this quarter of the horoscope. But Mars, which is
the ruler of the Ascendant and the sixth house, both
ruling the health, is the strongest and best-aspected
planet in the horoscope. Mars is in the 11th house in
Libra, in conjunction with the Moon, trine to Jupiter.
And we may also say that Mars is sextile to Saturn,
although seemingly out of orb, for Saturn is retrograding
and therefore throwing his influence towards Mars. Also
we may expect that Mars will receive some help from 252 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the life-giving Sun, the Sun's orb being larger than that
of other planets.
When a patient has fixed signs on the four angles
and a well-aspected Mars, he will make a greater effort
to overcome than one who has not these influences. This
boy should be placed in the home of a nurse who has
Scorpio or Aries on the Ascendant, and away from the
parents, for the home, under the rule of the Father, is no
place for him. With this change and proper care he might
be able to gain at least partial control of his body and be
able to walk and feed himself; but he will never be very
bright mentally, and will always to some extent be a
charge to his parents. THE SPINE 253 NO. 9C—TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SPINE
Female, born March 17, 1889, 7:04 A.M. T HE fiery and martial sign of Aries is on the
Ascendant, with Mars, the ruler of the
horoscope, in its own sign in the 1st house, giving great
energy and impulse. Mars also in opposition to the
erratic Uranus will tend to make this young woman
unable to use moderation in anything. But she will be
like a skyrocket which is sent with great force into the
air: as soon as it has spent its energy it falls back to earth
dull and lifeless. With the life-giving Sun, the ruler of
the 6th house of sickness, in the negative and watery sign
of Pisces, and posited in the 12th house in opposition to
the watery Moon, which is in the house of sickness and
in the earthy and common sign of Virgo, this woman has
not sufficient vitality to keep up with the impulse of the
double fiery influence on the Ascendant and is soon
depleted in strength.
Mercury is sextile to Mars from the mental and fixed
sign of Aquarius. This makes the native very quick and
active mentally, but whatever she becomes interested in
she takes up with such force that the nervous system
suffers. This is increased by Mercury square to its higher
octave, Neptune, in Taurus.
The Sun, afflicted and intercepted in the 12th house
in Pisces, would indicate a very unhappy and restricted
life in early childhood. And as the Moon, ruler of the 4th 254 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS house, the home and the mother, is afflicted, it would
indicate that much of the restriction will come from this
direction. We are told in the Rosicrucian teachings that we are
building the archetype in this life of the body we shall
inhabit in a future life, and that we are attracted to the
parents who are physically, mentally, and morally able to
supply us with such a body. In this case this young girl THE SPINE 255 was attracted to a mother who was selfish and
neurasthenic, for the afflicted Moon in Virgo in the 6th
house would represent the mother. The Moon also
afflicts the small intestines, giving poor assimilation of
food, which lowers the vitality. We find Saturn, the ruler
of the 10th house, representing the Father, square to
Venus in her own sign of Taurus, ruling the throat and
palate, which indicates that the Father was fond of the
wine cup; he was, in fact, a drunkard. This would
corroborate the indications, shown by the afflicted Sun
above the Ascendant, of a hard life with many privations
in childhood.
Now let us see how the afflictions between Saturn
and Venus would affect the health. As Leo is the sign
ruling the heart and the spinal cord, Saturn, the restricter,
when placed in this sign, square to Venus which rules the
venous blood, causes a restricted circulation. It is stated
in The Message of the Stars, page 555, that Saturn in Leo
gives a tendency to curvature and disease of the spine.
The physical body is the crystallized counterpart of the
finer vehicles. The vital body holds the physical atoms
together. This vital body, which is ruled by the Sun,
surrounds and interpenetrates the physical. If the Sun in
a person's horoscope is afflicted, the vital fluid is
obstructed and the vital body becomes diseased, as this
invisible force gains its entrance through the spleen,
which is also ruled by the Sun. Therefore, we can readily
see that the vital fluids were obstructed from childhood. 256 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS This young woman's case was diagnosed by the
doctors as tubercular disease of the spine, Potts' disease.
In December of 1918 and January 1919 she had severe
attacks of inflammation of the spine and has had several
spinal operations.
It will be very difficult to heal this patient on account
of her great impulsiveness and the wasting of vitality.
With Sun and Moon afflicted in the 6th and 12th houses,
she will dissipate her strength and will rebel at restraint.
She has Venus in the 1st house in Taurus, trine to
Jupiter on the cusp of the Midheaven. This with Neptune
in Taurus sextile to the Sun should give wonderful
musical ability and the faculty of writing and
improvising music. The impaired physical body and
consequent suffering will soften the nature and bring out
the spiritual side. Neptune is making a trine to the Moon,
as a result of which this girl could develop talent for the
inspirational and spiritual side of music, which would
bring wonderful soul growth. This soul will make greater
spiritual progress in this one life of suffering than she
could in three ordinary lives with perfect health. THE SPINE 257 NO. 9D, 9E—INABILITY TO WALK
Male, born January 18, 1919, 12 Noon. I N this lesson we will try to show how a doctor,
who can only observe from outward and physical
signs and who depends for his diagnosis upon symptoms
only, can err in his diagnosis, and how the science of
astro-diagnosis proves that functional weakness is shown
even at birth. “A chain is as strong as its weakest link,”
is a proverbial expression, and so it is with the physical
body. We may go along smoothly for many years,
seemingly in good health, when suddenly something
goes wrong, a link begins to weaken. The strain which
we have been putting on our physical body causes this
weak place to give way.
This horoscope is that of a boy with the fixed sign of
Taurus on the Ascendant, and with the Sun in Capricorn
on the cusp of the Midheaven. The life-giving Sun,
however, makes only a semi-sextile to Mars and Uranus,
besides its conjunction with the Midheaven, therefore the
boy cannot expect a great amount of help from this
planet. We find Uranus in its own sign of Aquarius,
elevated in the 11th house, in conjunction with and
parallel to the dynamic Mars, and in opposition and
parallel to the obstructive Saturn, which is in the fixed
sign of Leo and in the 5th house. We also find the Moon
in the same sign, in conjunction with Saturn and in
opposition to Mars and Uranus. 258 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS We are told in The Message of the Stars, page 555,
that Saturn afflicted in Leo gives a tendency to spinal
diseases and sclerosis of the spinal cord. The Moon has
rule over the synovial fluid, and with its affliction by
Saturn, which has rule over the bony structures and the ligaments, and with the Moon and Saturn both in the sign
of Leo, which has rule over the spinal column, we may
expect that the seat of the trouble will be found in this THE SPINE 259 latter region. Saturn dries up and causes atrophy.
Therefore we may diagnose this case as a lack of
synovial fluid to lubricate the vertebrae of the spine, also
a loss of strength in the ligaments which connect the
spinal bones.
The result is that this child, while healthy and wellformed, seemingly in moderate health, still was unable to
bear his weight on his legs. He would draw them up each
time that the nurse attempted to teach him to stand. This
affliction, which comes from fixed signs, will be a most
difficult one to overcome unless a miracle is performed
through spiritual healing, although by patient
manipulation with olive oil over the spinal region and a
careful vegetarian diet the child may be helped to a very
great extent. 260 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 9E
Male, born December 13, 1868. T HIS horoscope leads to a very different
diagnosis. Having no hour of birth we use a flat
figure. We find in this case also the Moon in conjunction with the obstructive Saturn, but in the sign of Sagittarius
ruling the hips. Saturn is in conjunction with and parallel THE SPINE 261 to Mercury, and square to Mars. In 1914, after a spell of
typhoid fever, this man was unable to walk without
crutches. He could not stand without swaying. The
doctors believed this weakness to have its seat in the
spinal cord, while astrology diagnoses it as a drying up
of the synovial fluid of the hip joints. When the weight is
put on the pelvic region by standing, stooping, or by any
strained position, the pelvic bones slip out of position
and in turn press on the sciatic nerve, which controls the
sacral plexus and the limbs. A pressure on this nerve
may cause what is termed paralysis of the lower limbs.
A case of this kind, however, is curable. A slight
adjustment by an osteopathic physician or a chiropractor
will eliminate the pressure upon the sciatic nerve. Here
we may see what a vast difference there is between astrodiagnosis and medical diagnosis. The healer who has a
knowledge of the planets and their effect upon the
physical body may find a great difference in cases which
may have the same outward or physical symptoms. Also
a knowledge of body adjustment is often very helpful. CHAPTER XXI
THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER
NO. 10A—THE LIVER
Male, born March 6th, 1831, Júpiter Plutão .M. T HIS is the horoscope of a man with the fixed
and fiery sign of Leo on the Ascendant, and the
obstructing Saturn in Leo in the 1st house.
Whenever Saturn is placed in an angle, a fixed sign,
or near the Ascendant, his influence is much more
destructive than elsewhere, especially when in the sign
of Leo, which rules the heart. Then we may expect that
the person will be lacking in vitality—especially so in
the case of this man, as we find Saturn in square aspect
to the dynamic Mars, and Mars in its fall and near the
cusp of the 10th house, where its destructive influence
may result in the greatest amount of damage, particularly
as we find these two afflicting and powerful planets in
Leo and Taurus, two of the most powerful signs in the
horoscope. These planets are of opposite natures; Saturn
is cold and moist, while Mars is fiery, and dry.
Consequently we may expect that the body will suffer as
a result. 262 THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER 263 The Sun, the ruler of the Ascendant, is posited in the
8th house, in the negative sign of Pisces, square to the
Moon. Here again we find an indication of depleted
energy and lack of vitality. Now let us see how these afflictions work. The 10th
house indicates the father, and Mars afflicted by a square
to Mercury and Saturn, and in Taurus near the cusp of
the Midheaven would indicate the death of the Father by 264 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS accident. At the age of twelve years, when the Moon
passed the Midheaven and the conjunction of Mars, the
Father was killed by the falling of a tree, leaving the
mother and three small children penniless. This forced
the eldest boy, whose horoscope we are delineating, to
help earn the wherewithal to live. He was placed as an
assistant to a blacksmith in the neighborhood, and was
compelled at the growing age of twelve years to do a
man's work, wielding the heavy sledgehammer. As a
result the valves of the heart were not fully developed.
For years he suffered, and each time he reached a state of
financial success, his health would break, forcing him to
give up and change to another climate for relief. Some
doctors diagnosed his trouble as tuberculosis, others as
asthma. He had all the indications of asthma, but these
spells would come and go. Each winter while in the cold,
eastern climate he spent some time in bed with
pneumonia or congestion of the lungs.
Here we see the effect of the affliction of Sun square
Moon from the two common signs of Pisces and
Sagittarius. We find Mercury in the fixed sign of
Aquarius, in opposition to Saturn and square to Mars in
Taurus, the throat, which would give some tendency
toward a nervous contraction of the trachea.
Now we have found the afflicting planets indicating
valvular heart trouble and weak lungs, but the man died
from an abscess of the liver. Where do we find the
indication of liver trouble? Mars in Taurus is in his
detriment. This planet is the strongest in the horoscope; THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER 265 in fact, Mars may be called the life ruler. When in the
sign ruling the throat, it gives a desire to tickle the palate
and a thirst which often leads to strong drink. In this case
we find Mars sextile to the Sun and trine to Neptune.
Neptune governs and sometimes predisposes to the use
of drugs. This had its result in an abnormal desire for
strong, black coffee. Instead of quenching his thirst with
water, this man would drink cold coffee and in large
quantities. Mars in Taurus also gives an abnormal
appetite, indicating one who is apt to gourmandize. With
the lowered vitality, on account of the affliction to the
heart and poor oxygenation in the lungs, the native was
unable to do manual labor, thereby being unable to work
off the excess of food. Consequently the poor liver was
worked over time and became a receptacle for the
poisons created by the excess of food which could not be
absorbed by the blood. Jupiter rules the liver. We find
Jupiter in conjunction with and parallel to Uranus in the
6th house of sickness, also parallel to the Moon.
Naturally the liver would be sluggish and easily
overtaxed.
If this man had lived normally, he could have
reached a ripe old age, in spite of the planetary
afflictions, for with Mars elevated and sextile to the Sun,
with the Moon sextile to Jupiter, and with fixed signs on
the angles there is no reason why he should have passed
out at the comparatively early period of middle life. 266 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 10B—GALLSTONES
Male, born November 13, 1885, 8:52 Plutão .M. W E will judge first the mental caliber so that we
may be better able to deal with our patient, for
the basic quality and trend of the mind have a great
determining influence as to the way a person views
sickness, and we must be prepared to meet his ideas in
such a manner that we inspire confidence. Mercury rules
the 3rd house, which governs the lower mind. Its parallel
to Saturn, the planet of obstruction, curbs this flighty
constituent of the personality and gives it depth, but this
aspect also gives a tendency to look at the dark side of
things. Pessimism and melancholy are among its results.
Mars in the mercurial sign of Virgo, square to Mercury,
makes the native cynical and quick to anger.
Saturn in Cancer, the sign of the stomach, shows us
that digestion is obstructed. His opposition to Venus and
the square of both to Uranus in Libra show that the
venous circulation is also obstructed, particularly that of
the renal veins, which carry the blood from the kidneys
(Uranus in Libra), and that part of the portal system
which carries the blood from the stomach (Saturn in
Cancer), through the liver. Saturn rules the gall bladder,
and his position in Cancer, square Uranus in the sign of
the kidneys (Libra), shows the concretion of sediment in
both of these organs. As brick is baked clay, hardened by
heat pent up in the kiln, so this sediment is burned into THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER 267 gallstones and renal stones by the restraining action of
Saturn when anger is kindled by Mars. Inward, impotent
rage and vindictiveness which wait for an opportunity to
get even, the nursing of a grievance instead of letting anger have vent and then forgetting it, harmful though
that may be, are the true cause of one of the most painful
maladies to which flesh is heir.
The trine of Jupiter and Neptune show the way of
liberation through appeal to the higher nature, for there is 268 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS a basic benevolence that may be invoked. Physical
treatments can and must of course be given, but however
effective they may prove for the time being, they are
merely palliative, for until the patient changes his mental
attitude there can be no real cure. Continued inward rage
will form new stones to take the place of those
eliminated or dissolved by the treatment. To thoroughly
impress this fact upon the patient is the first duty of the
astro-therapeutic health adjuster. The harm has been
done in the present case, and cultivation of serenity can
only act to correct. But if a configuration like this is
noted in the horoscope of a child, we ought to warn the
parents so that this trait of nursing wrath may be
eradicated before it gets a hold on the growing girl or
boy. Prevention is always better than cure. It is not
enough just to help people to regain health; our aim
should be to teach them how to live in harmony with the
laws of love and life that they may never be sick. Until
we thoroughly realize this and practice it, we are missing
the greatest part of our privilege.
A person with Scorpio rising would be our first
choice when selecting a healer for this case; one with
Taurus would come next. But neither may have Saturn in
the degrees of the signs included in the patient's 1st or
6th houses. The treatments, both mental and physical,
should be given in the hour of the Sun. Large doses of
olive oil or copious draughts of hot water would be of
great assistance. THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER 269 NO. 10C, 10D—GALLSTONES
Male, born April 23rd, 1850. N O. 10C is the horoscope of a judge of the
Supreme Court, whose hour of birth we could
not ascertain, but from events in his life we judge that
Capricorn would be on the cusp of the Ascendant.
Although the writer never met this man in person, yet
from indications in the home he was born some time
near Mercúrio :30 or 10 Plutão .M. This would place Jupiter and the
Moon in or near the Midheaven or the 9th house which
would correspond with his character, for from reports of
friends he was a very efficient and just judge. He had
much inharmony in his home, which would be indicated
by Saturn and Uranus in Aries in the 4th house,
describing the wife as nagging and erratic. Saturn is
square to Mars in Cancer in the 7th house, again showing
inharmony and quarreling with the marriage partner.
The Judge was also greatly troubled through the
weakness of an only son, who squandered his time in
drink and immorality, spending his money on the
opposite sex. This is shown by the position of Venus in
the 5th house, governing children, also pleasures. Venus
is very strong in the sign of Taurus, which rules the
palate, and it is also sextile to Mars in Cancer, ruling the
stomach.
People with Capricorn rising and with the ruler,
Saturn, afflicted have a tendency always to see the dark 270 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS side of life and to brood over it, and when Saturn is
square to Mars there is much temper, but not of the
explosive kind. Capricorn people cannot as a rule forgive and forget. Suppressed anger, when continued for years,
will crystallize the bile in the gall bladder, which will
have a tendency to form into small stones, causing
intense pain while they are being eliminated. The Judge
suffered from these stones for nearly twenty years. THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER 271 About 1894 the progressed Saturn neared an exact
square to the radical Mars, which may have set the time
for the beginning of the forming of these stones. This
patient passed into the higher life on January 1, 1916,
when the transiting Saturn had reached the square to its
own place at birth. NO. 10D
Female, born December 14, 1855, at 10 A.M. T HIS is the horoscope of a woman who has
Capricorn on the Ascendant, and the ruler,
Saturn, is in the 5th house, square to the inflammatory
Mars. We have noted from a number of horoscopes in
our files of patients who have suffered from gallstones
that they have had Saturn and Mars conjunction or
square. Saturn in this horoscope is in the house ruling
children, the 5th, and square to Mars in the 8th. This
woman's troubles were caused by aggravations by the
children of her husband's first marriage, the stepchildren.
Note how clearly this is shown by Mercury and the Sun
in the 11th house, which rules stepchildren, square to
Neptune, ruler of the 2nd house. Anger and inharmony
arose in her home on account of her husband's finances,
and as usual the Capricorn nature would not forget and
forgive, holding resentment within until she paid the 272 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS penalty in 1903 when she had the first attack of
gallstones, followed by another attack fourteen years
later, about 1917. The progressed Moon was in
Sagittarius in 1903 and in Gemini in 1917. The exact
time of the illness is not given, but the opposition and the
conjunction of the progressed Moon with Saturn will no
doubt register the exact time. This disease is one of the most painful of afflictions.
When the stones pass from the gall bladder, pressing THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER 273 through the tiny gall duct which leads into the
duodenum, they often get partly through this duct but
remain wedged in, causing intense suffering. A very safe
and often most beneficial remedy is to have ready onehalf cup of olive oil and the juice of one lemon. Set the
alarm clock to go off at 3 A.M. At that time drink all of
the oil followed by the juice of the lemon. Refrain from
eating breakfast, and eat very little during the day.
Repeat this for three nights in succession, and the third
morning take a cathartic. A tablespoon of Epsom salts
has been used by some with excellent results. If this does
not eliminate the gallstones, try the remedy again about
two or three weeks later. CHAPTER XXII
THE CIRCULATION
NO. 11A—PALPITATION OF THE HEART
Female, born April 24, 1862, midnight. T HE Ascendant in this chart is occupied by the
saturnine sign of Capricorn, with Saturn, the
ruler, intercepted in the 8th house. When we find the life
ruler so weakly situated and afflicted, we may look for a
person who is very likely to become a victim of
circumstances, instead of being victor—one who will
allow the planets to rule her instead of her ruling the
planets. Where Saturn is afflicted in the house of
limitations, the native is very gloomy and always looks
at the dark side of life, and if he suffers physically, he is
very apt, like the Virgoans, to give in to the disease.
Wherever Saturn, the plant of obstruction, is posited in
the horoscopes, we may look for trouble. In this case we
find him in the sign of Virgo, ruling the small intestines,
and in conjunction with the planet Jupiter, which rules
the arterial circulation. Jupiter also has rule over the
adrenals. The secretion of these glands is necessary to 274 THE CIRCULATION 275 give tone to the blood, and when restricted by Saturn we
may expect that the arterial blood will be disturbed. But we do not judge by Saturn and his influence
alone. We find the planet Venus, ruling the venous
blood, in conjunction with the Moon, which has rule
over the synovial fluids, the lubricants of the body.
Venus and the Moon are in opposition to Jupiter and
Saturn. What would be the effect upon the body of the 276 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS afflictions of the above four planets? Due to the
restricting influence of Saturn we may expect trouble
with the arterial circulation. With the venous blood also
restricted there is no freedom to the blood flow, and the
effect is the same as that of a stagnant stream of water
which becomes muddy and full of poisonous weeds. We
may expect the blood to become polluted and stagnant.
We extract a certain amount of minerals from our
food, which while we are children can all be utilized to
build bone; but after we have reached our full stature and
the body can use little of this mineral matter for its
growth, if taken in excess it then deposits in the joints
and blood stream, clinging to the surface of the little
blood vessels in the same manner that it does on the
inside of a teakettle. If the circulation is good and the
blood has freedom to flow through the arteries and veins
in a natural manner, this deposit is very slight; but in old
age or when circulation is impaired, this mineral is
deposited in the blood and causes what is commonly
known as sclerosis or hardening of the arteries. In this
case the walls of the blood vessels are covered with a
deposit of hard mineral substance, consequently the
blood flow is impeded. The muscles and joints become
stiff and sore, and gradually, as this condition becomes
chronic, the person loses the use of arms and limbs and
chronic invalidism is the result.
In this horoscope we find both Jupiter and Saturn
posited in Virgo, ruling the small intestine. This small
tube, although it is between 20 and 25 feet in length, is THE CIRCULATION 277 coiled in a small space in the abdominal region. It is
lined with mucous membrane and small tongue-like
vessels that assist in digesting and absorbing the food
elements, afterwards distributing various minerals
extracted from the food into the white and red fluids of
the body. If the mucous membrane and these villi of the
intestines are obstructed by Saturn, as in the case of this
woman whose Moon is also opposed by this afflicter,
then the secretion of lymph and chyle, the white fluids of
the body, is obstructed, and in addition, the blood
receives little nourishment.
The woman suffers greatly from palpitation of the
heart, headaches, high blood pressure, and a constant
pain in back and limbs. When the blood has become
sluggish and filled with ash it stands to reason that the
heart must suffer, for when through undue excitement or
anger an excess of blood is drawn to the heart and the
clogged condition of the blood vessels prevents it from
freely leaving this central station, palpitation, high blood
pressure, rush of blood to the head, and various other
afflictions naturally result.
Now, what can we give as a remedy for such a
condition? First of all we would advise a simple and very
light diet with very little starch, less sugar, but more of
raw onion, lettuce, spinach, etc. Always keep the bowels
free, and give the body a dry rub with a pair of bath mitts
each morning on arising and at night before going to bed.
Unfortunately, a woman with the Sun unaspected, as in
this case, except by a semi-sextile to Neptune, and with 278 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS afflicting planets in Virgo and Pisces, will not make the
effort to get well. It is so much less trouble to drift into
invalidism. NO. 11B—SLUGGISH CIRCULATION AND
CATARACTS
Female, born April Mercúrio , 1851, 1:58 A.M. W E first judge as usual the mentality of our
patient. Aries, the sign of the head, has more
planets than any other, and two of these are malefics.
Even if this were all it would be unfortunate and an
indication of unfavorable characteristics, but the
affliction of Saturn in Aries to the Sun, Moon, Mercury,
Uranus, and Jupiter tell us this is a subtle and
untrustworthy person, who is sadly indifferent to moral
obligations of truth and justice. Nor is it to be wondered
at that such pronounced mental characteristics should
produce a marked effect upon the bodily functions,
especially as the afflictions are all from cardinal signs.
Saturn, the planet of obstruction, makes the native
subtle and cautious mentally by his conjunction with
Mercury and square to the Moon, and also protects her
from being “found out.” This same configuration THE CIRCULATION 279 obstructs the flow of nerve force, and thus causes a
clogging of both the voluntary and sympathetic nervous
systems, which are ruled by Mercury and the Moon respectively. Saturn's principal field of activity will be
found in the pneumogastric nerve, which is normally
saturnine and suppressive in its action upon the heart,
stomach, and other vital organs. The conjunction of
Saturn with the Sun is aggravated by the fact that they 280 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS are in parallel, situated in the first cardinal sign, Aries,
ruling the head, square to the Moon in the second
cardinal sign, Cancer, which rules the stomach, and in
opposition to Jupiter in the third cardinal sign, Libra,
which rules the kidneys. Were it not for the trine of Mars
to the Moon and the placement of the Sun in its
exaltation sign, Aries, it would be difficult for life to be
sustained in this severely afflicted nativity.
This person is afflicted with sluggish circulation,
indigestion, and nervous constipation on account of the
planetary afflictions mentioned. Still, this is far from the
worst trouble. The conjunction of the planets in Aries,
the head, and their opposition to Jupiter, which rules the
arterial circulation, show plainly how the nerves and
blood vessels are clogged in that most important part of
the body, the head. As a consequence there is a dearth of
material with which to build up the various organs, and
an accumulation of waste. We all know that a bad
stomach reacts on the eyes, and when we consider the
effect of the Sun and Saturn in Aries square to the Moon
in Cancer, we see that it is small wonder that both eyes
are afflicted with the saturnine obstruction known as
cataract.
A Taurus healer would be best fitted to handle this
case, and it should be made very, very plain to the
patient that frankness and strict adherence to truth are an
absolute necessity for recovery. Even if resented at first,
a kindly statement of the fact of the opposite fault and its
effects will probably bring a change. A religious attitude THE CIRCULATION 281 of mind will loosen the tension of nerves, allowing the
bodily functions greater freedom. Uncooked food should
be given in as large a measure as the patient will allow,
for its ether is necessary to build up the nerves. Onions
are prime builders, and pineapple is unrivaled as a
digestive stimulant. But in this case physical factors,
though of vital importance, pale into insignificance in
comparison with the benefit that will be derived from a
proper appreciation of the moral factors that have caused
the disease, and a realization of the imperative necessity
of altering the trend of mind before any permanent relief
can be experienced. Nor should the healer despair and
feel that this is a case analogous to that of the leopard
changing its spots, for the afflictions are from cardinal
signs and therefore movable. It requires thought and
energy to plan how to deceive successfully, and this
energy, if turned to good, will be a factor of equal power
in bringing the light of truth into the patient's life and
letting it shine for others.
(The above was the diagnosis of this case in 1915.
The outcome in 1919 is given in 2BX, page 94—Ed.) 282 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 11D—VARICOSE VEINS
Female, born January 17, 1875, 7:00 A.M. T HIS woman has the saturnian sign of Capricorn
on the Ascendant, with the life ruler, Saturn, in
Aquarius where this planet is at home and most
powerful. Being in the first house, in an angle, and in a
fixed sign we may look to Saturn as having the most
powerful influence on the life as well as the health of the
native.
We find that the obstructing Saturn is in square
aspect to the inflammatory Mars. This last named plant
is on the cusp of the Midheaven and also in an angle; it is
in its own sign of Scorpio where it is powerful. Mars is
square to the spasmodic Uranus, which is in the sign of
its fall, the fixed sign of Leo, and also angular in the
seventh house. Consequently, these three malefics so
powerfully situated in fixed signs and in the angles will
be very difficult to overcome.
Mars in the Midheaven will dominate the actions of
this woman, and it being square to the restless Uranus
will incline toward excessive social activity. With the
Capricorn egotism enhanced by the Sun and Mercury in
the first house in Capricorn, square to Jupiter and
Neptune, the native would aspire to shine in society.
Especially would this be true with Venus in the active
sign of Sagittarius and in the eleventh house, ruling
friends. With Venus sextile to Saturn she would aim to THE CIRCULATION 283 lead in games and social affairs, into which she would
enter with all the impulse of the Mars-Uranus nature. Capricorn people are not very robust, and with the
Sun and Mercury on the Ascendant in Capricorn
afflicted by the square of Jupiter and Neptune, both
these last-named planets being in martial signs, giving
impulse, the native would be very apt to dissipate her
strength, the result being a physical break in the weakest 284 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS part. The greatest afflictions in this horoscope are found
in the region of the knees, Capricorn, and the lower
limbs, Aquarius, causing enlargement of the veins.
Varices are caused by interferences in the Venus
circulation resulting from overtaxing the muscles or
nerves of certain parts of the body.
Venus being the best-aspected planet and free from
afflictions in the sign of sports, Sagittarius, in the
eleventh house of friends, trine to Uranus and sextile to
Saturn, and Mars, being prominent in the Midheaven,
indicate that the patient was an enthusiast in games; also
in the entertainment of friends, for the Moon is wellaspected by the Sun and Mercury and is in the Venus
sign of Taurus in the 4th house, indicating the home,
where the native would be lavish in her entertainments.
The consequent exertion would put a heavy strain upon
the heart. Uranus in Leo, square to Mars, and opposition
Saturn indicates organic heart trouble, and causes a
spasmodic gushing of blood through the aorta.
Interference with the natural flow of blood through the
heart will cause a disturbance in the veins in other
afflicted parts of the body, as in this case, where we find
enlarged veins in the lower limbs.
This woman called upon our Healing Department for
help in September, 1920, while under the care of the
doctors in a hospital, after having had a second operation
for varicose veins. At that time the progressed Venus had
reached a conjunction with the radical Sun, and the
progressed Moon was also in that part of the horoscope. THE CIRCULATION 285 The transiting Sun, Mercury, and Saturn were in
conjunction in Virgo, the sign of health. The transiting
Saturn was square to the radical Venus, which brought
on the last attack and was responsible for her submitting
to the operation.
Ordinary cases of varicose veins may be relieved and
even cured by bandages, and by a removal of strain so
that the circulation of the blood may become more
normal. When the knife is used, however, as in this case,
healing is interfered with. 286 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 11E—RESTRICTED CIRCULATION
Female, born April 13th, 1862. T HIS horoscope is minus the hour of birth, but as
the given time of birth is frequently unreliable
on account of the difference in time and clocks, unless
we have some data by which we can correct the
horoscope, we are nearly as safe in using a flat figure—
diagnosing from the planets and signs only. A very safe
diagnosis may be arrived at by this method. Only when it
is necessary to watch for the crisis in order to help the
patient pass through a critical period is it necessary that
we have the hour of birth. This is then required in order
to observe the progressed Moon and the aspects of the
transiting planets.
We here find Saturn, the malefic, conjunction Jupiter
in the sign of Virgo. Virgo is the natural sixth house sign
and therefore rules health and sickness to a very great
extent. We find that people who are ruled largely by
Virgo are prone to think much of their health and often
become hypochondriacs. When several planets are found
in this sign, we may trace the cause of disease to this part
of the horoscope. The small intestine is the organ of
distribution of the nutriment, where much of the food
must go to be distributed to the various parts of the body
through the blood. The intestines are to the body what
the commissary department is to the army. Therefore
Virgo necessarily is a most vital part of the horoscope. THE CIRCULATION 287 Jupiter is the planet ruling the arterial circulation and
the glycogen of the liver, and Saturn has rule over the gall bladder and the pneumogastric nerve, the most
important of all nerves, which sends its branches to the
three most important parts of the body, namely, the
heart, stomach, and lungs. Here they affect the
distribution and digestion of the food in the small 288 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS intestine due to the sluggishness of the gall bladder in
furnishing the needed amount of bile and through
impaired peristalsis. As a consequence the tiny blood
vessels which are distributed over the inner intestinal
surface are robbed of their nutriment, and the blood
stream becomes deficient and sluggish, causing anemia.
Especially is this true since we also find Venus,
which rules the venous blood, afflicted by a square of
Uranus, these planets being in the common signs of
Pisces and Gemini. Uranus is also squaring Saturn and
Jupiter. This will interfere with the oxygenation of the
blood as it passes through the capillaries of the lungs.
Before middle life these afflictions may express
themselves through colds, pneumonia, and painful
menstruation. But after middle life when the body begins
to feel the strain of years, these afflictions will cause
anemia, arteriosclerosis, and high blood pressure. The
patient suffered from the latter three diseases, and at the
age of sixty was threatened with paralysis of the right
side. She also had a dizzy, reeling feeling in the head.
A healer should advise such a patient against
stimulants such as coffee, tea, etc. Stimulation by friction
of the skin would be of great benefit, using a pair of bath
gloves night and morning and rubbing the body until it
glows. Keep the mind free from excitement and worry,
adopt a light and carefully selected vegetarian diet, and
drink plenty of pure water between meals. THE CIRCULATION 289 NO. 11F—PERNICIOUS ANEMIA
Female, born Aug. 12, 1886, 5:00 A.M. W E are using this chart to impress upon the
mind of the student the great necessity of
advising patients as to the proper diet. Ninety per cent of
those who are suffering and broken down in health are ill
not on account of the lack of food but because of wrong
combinations or too much food.
This young woman has the fixed sign of Leo on the
Ascendant, and the Sun, the ruler, on the cusp of the first
house. We find the obstructive Saturn in his detriment in
the sign of Cancer, which rules the stomach. Venus, the
planet ruling the venous circulation, is in conjunction
with Saturn and in opposition to the negative Moon,
which is in its detriment in the Saturnian sign of
Capricorn. Since Saturn and the Moon are both in their
detriment and in mutual reception, the power for evil of
these two planets is greatly increased. The opposition
occurs from the sixth house, that of sickness, to the
twelfth house, that of hospitals, confinement, and selfundoing. We can well see how this poor soul has been
responsible for her complete breakdown. She has for
years been an invalid in bed, not able to use her limbs.
The doctors have stated her disease to be arteriosclerosis.
We find that Jupiter, ruling the arterial circulation, is
afflicted by the conjunction of Uranus in Libra, and that
Venus, ruling the venous circulation, is square to Mars, 290 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS these two latter planets being respectively in the sign of
the kidneys and the stomach. Mars is also square to the
Moon in the house of sickness, the sixth. With these planetary afflictions to the stomach there is a tendency to
overeat. The opposition of Venus and the Moon gives a
great desire for liquids and sweets, and Saturn gives an
abnormal desire for unnatural foods and an excess of
pastries, starches, etc. This patient's body was like a THE CIRCULATION 291 stove that is filled with paper: when the paper is burned
it makes a terrific heat, but the heat is not lasting, and the
stove is quickly filled with ashes.
With Saturn in Cancer, there is a lack of gastric juice
in the stomach. Leo is rising and the Sun and Mercury
are on the Ascendant in sextile to Mars. These positions
give an unusual amount of energy but also the tendency
to dissipate it. When the body has become worn out and
tired, the stomach cannot digest the food; then if too
much food is partaken of, decomposition takes place,
especially if the meal is made up of inharmonious food
elements. In the present case the poor weak stomach has
been stuffed to overflowing with food, and then cold
water or hot tea with sugar has been poured in after it.
What was the result? Fermentation took place and the
food turned to poison instead of nourishing the body.
This poor young woman at the age of twenty-four was an
invalid. Her body was filled with ash, and with both the
venous and arterial circulation impaired the blood could
not remain pure. She dissipated her energy, could not use
moderation. She went to excess in food, play, and mental
work, and the result was that the body could not throw
out the ash accumulated from the excessive and illbalanced food.
If she had come in contact with a doctor who would
have placed her on a rational and carefully chosen diet
and who would not have given her poisonous narcotics,
she could have been saved much suffering. Man often
starves in the midst of plenty, overloading his stomach 292 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS while the body is really starving from non-assimilation,
as was the case with this young woman. She lived to
satisfy her appetite, but did not give her body bloodmaking food. Her joints became stiff, her body ached,
and in a few years she became a confirmed invalid and is
now confined in a hospital. If she were taken to a
hospital where scientific dietary treatment is given, she
could yet become a useful woman.
When we meet such poor unfortunate ones, it
behooves us who aspire to become helpers and healers of
humanity to use our efforts to guide them in the right
direction. THE CIRCULATION 293 NO. 11G—RHEUMATISM AND IMPURE BLOOD
Male, born August 14, 1912, 1:30 Plutão .M. W E are using here the horoscope of a young
man with the martial sign of Scorpio on the
Ascendant, and with the life ruler, Mars, in the 10th
house, sextile to the Ascendant and in conjunction with
the watery Moon. Where we find the close conjunction
of a hot and inflammatory planet with a cold and watery
one, as in this case, and especially in the sign of Virgo,
which is the natural sixth house sign governing sickness,
we may expect that it is a starting point of illness, for fire
and water create steam.
Virgo is the sign which has rule over the small
intestine, the intestines being among the principal organs
for the digestion, assimilation, and distribution of the
food. The inflammatory Mars in this sign causes
inflammation of the intestines. As Mars is in conjunction
with the Moon, the latter having rule over the
lymphatics, we may expect that the lymphatic vessels
and glands will be disturbed in their functions. They are
carriers between the cells of the body and the blood. Not
only do they carry some of the nutriment of the food to
the blood, but they also act as cleansers, taking up a part
of the waste matter and carrying it where it may be
eliminated from the body through the excretory organs.
When the Moon is afflicted by the inflammatory Mars in
Virgo, we may expect the lymphatics to be inflamed and 294 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS not able to function so as to help the blood in its work.
The Moon has rule over the chyle, or white fluid which
has been extracted from the food through the villi of the
small intestine. This intermingles with the lymph and
passes on into the circulation. These white fluids, which
are so necessary in the work of feeding the blood, are
obstructed in the case of this boy. We have still another affliction which interferes with
the purification of the blood stream. Saturn, the THE CIRCULATION 295 obstructor, is in the sign of Gemini. Gemini has rule over
the lungs. Saturn is in opposition to the planet Jupiter,
ruling the arterial circulation, and square to Venus,
which has rule over the venous blood. The lungs are the
bellows of the body. Into the tiny capillaries of these
organs the pure air passes and the blood is thus
oxygenated and aerated. The pure oxygen is drawn into
the air cells of the lungs, the poisonous carbon dioxide is
exhaled, and thus the body is freed from a large portion
of its poisons. Whenever we find Saturn in the sign of
Gemini, especially if this planet is afflicted by both
Jupiter and Venus, we may expect the blood to be
unhealthy and impure, for Saturn, the obstructor, is
stationed at the door of the respiratory system, partially
shutting out the air from without and also partially
keeping the carbon dioxide within the body.
With these planetary afflictions we may look from a
health point of view for impure and anemic blood; also a
tendency to intestinal inflammation, which will interfere
with the proper assimilation and distribution of the food.
This boy at the age of eight years suffered from blotches
and eruptions of the skin. As the Moon has rule over the
synovial fluid, we may see how the conjunction of Mars
with the Moon caused rheumatism and fallen arches, an
indication that Mars burned up the oils which were
necessary to keep the joints of his legs and feet in order.
What a pity that the parents were not familiar with
the science of astrology! If they had been, they would
have known of these planetary afflictions and by a 296 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS careful diet, plenty of fresh air, and training in deep
breathing this boy could have been saved from much
suffering. From all indications tuberculosis of the lungs
may set in should he neglect his health by exposure to
cold, for with Saturn afflicted by both Venus and Jupiter
from common signs, he has naturally developed a habit
of shallow breathing, which will tend to induce lung
trouble. THE CIRCULATION 297 NO. 11H, 11I—RHEUMATISM W E will use two horoscopes in order to show
how planets placed in different signs will
bring about the same symptoms, the real causes of the
disease being different.
NO. 11H
The native, a woman, was born on March 16, 1865,
no hour given. We find the fiery, discordant Mars
conjunction the restless Uranus in the nervous sign of
Gemini (the arms and shoulders), and square to the lifegiving Sun and Mercury, which are in conjunction in the
watery sign of Pisces. Mars and Uranus are also in
opposition to Jupiter, which rules the arterial blood, and
Jupiter is square to the Sun and Mercury.
This patient has always had some trouble with
obstructed circulation, especially in the arms and legs.
Afflictions often work in squares and oppositions.
Illustrating this we find the assimilation in the small
intestine much impaired. Venus, the planet ruling the
venous circulation, is in opposition to the Moon, which
we find in the martial sign of Scorpio, ruling elimination,
the anus, urethra, and the generative organs. Saturn, the
planet of obstruction, is found in Libra, the kidneys, and
being placed in the last degree of this sign he obstructs
elimination through the ureters, the small ducts carrying
the urine from the kidneys to the bladder. 298 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS With all the many obstructions in the elimination of
waste matter and the impaired assimilation of food do we
wonder that when this woman reached the age of
menopause the body suffered and the blood became so
sluggish and impure that rheumatism was the result? Her
body was stiff, she found it almost impossible to move
about, and she suffered especially with the arms and
shoulders. THE CIRCULATION 299 NO. 11-I
The native, a man, was born December 6, 1870,
about 7:30 Plutão .M. There are four planets in the sign
Sagittarius in the 5th house, ruling pleasures and appetites. The Sun, ruler of the Ascendant, and Venus,
the ruler of the house of friends, are in conjunction and
square to the impulsive and discordant Mars, showing 300 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS that this man is fond of a good time. His love for wine
and women has been his undoing. He has indulged the
appetites, and he is surely paying the price of such
living.
Jupiter in the nervous sign of Gemini afflicted by the
opposition of the obstructing Saturn and nervous
Mercury, also square to the inflammatory Mars in the
sign of Virgo, the small intestine, are indications similar
to those in horoscope 11H. This man suffered from
numbness in the arms and hands. The great strain put
upon his system and the abuse of the poor stomach
caused neuritis, as both the venous and arterial
circulations are afflicted from the signs ruling the
nervous system.
The instruction given to both these patients would be
very similar, namely, a simple vegetarian diet,
elimination of meat, alcoholic drinks, and highly
seasoned foods, using plentifully green, raw vegetables,
especially lettuce and onions. The onion is a wonderful
nerve tonic and body scavenger. If taken at night in the
form of a sandwich, when the stomach is empty, it will
purify the kidneys and liver and build up the nervous
system. A good brisk massage with a pair of bath gloves
night and morning to keep the pores of the skin open and
stimulate the circulation is recommended. In case 11H
the bowels and kidneys should be kept free from
clogging, and food should be taken that works directly
upon the liver and kidneys. CHAPTER XXIII
LEPROSY
NO. 12A, 12B—LEPROSY
Male, born September 11, 1885, at 1:00 A.M. T HE writer feels that horoscopes 12A and 12B,
those of two brothers, will give students a most
helpful lesson in the diagnosing of disease, and show
that though the underlying causes and the outward
appearances of both cases are of a similar nature, still
these cases are entirely different when scientifically
diagnosed.
In both cases the relatives called upon Headquarters
for healing of the dread disease with which these
brothers were afflicted.
In horoscope 12A we find the watery sign of Cancer
on the Ascendant, with the obstructive Saturn near the
cusp and square to Uranus in Libra. Here we have two
planets which both by position and aspect indicate
eruptive blood disease, and show the two stations where
the poison is generated, namely, Cancer, the stomach,
and Libra, the kidneys.
Saturn in Cancer interferes with the peristaltic
action, which is so necessary in the churning and the 301 302 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS breaking up of food in the stomach. Saturn has a
tendency also to dry up the body fluids, and when in
Cancer, which is the sign of its fall, this planet is weak and therefore most
evil. Uranus is the higher octave of Venus, and as Venus
rules the moral nature on the lower planes, so does
Uranus rule or balance the morals on the higher planes.
Uranus in the Venus sign of Libra afflicted by a square LEPROSY 303 of Saturn would indicate that a lack of moral balance
was largely responsible for the physical ailment of the
patient.
Uranus has rule over the pituitary body or
hypophysis. This little organ, which is so wonderfully
protected in a cradle-like bone within the brain, consists
of two small lobes, the anterior and posterior. The
anterior lobe has rule over the sex or creative force and
over nerve fiber, while the posterior lobe contributes to
and controls the circulation of the fluids of the body,
especially the renal circulation.
With Uranus in Libra, which has rule over the
kidneys, square to the obstructive Saturn, and both in
cardinal signs, also with the impulsive-cardinal signs on
all the angles, we may expect excesses. With Mars, the
planet of dynamic energy and impulse, in the first house
in Cancer, square to the planets of pleasure and selfindulgence, Venus and the Moon (Venus being strongly
situated in its own sign of Libra and the Moon being the
ruler of the Ascendant, square to its own house), we may
conclude that this man through his excessive desires
indulged in sensual pleasure to such an extent that the
functions of the pituitary body became impaired. As the
pituitary body regulates the assimilation of food, and as
Saturn and Mars are afflicted in the sign of the stomach,
(Saturn in Cancer gives abnormal tastes and appetites,
and Mars in Cancer indicates a gourmand) we may
expect that this man would be apt to make a cesspool of
his body. 304 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS With Venus and the Moon in conjunction and square
to Mars in Cancer on the Ascendant, and with Saturn on
the cusp of the Ascendant, we may expect this person to
be very untidy and careless. He is one who would
neglect cleanliness of the body and of his surroundings,
also the elimination of toxic poisons through the colon,
kidneys, and skin. This would in time fill the body with
poisons which would ultimately cause eruption.
The skin would become dry and dead, for the
pituitary body, with the assistance of the thyroid gland,
feeds the skin. When these glands are tired and depleted
by sensual excesses, the conditions of the skin, as well as
the general circulation of the body, are impaired, dulling
the mentality and causing the slowing up of energies of
mind and body. In this case the result was leprosy.
This dread disease first made its appearance after the
Flood, when vegetation was scarce and Noah and his
family were forced to revert to the use of meat for food.
This together with excesses and degeneracy relating to
the generative function was responsible for this disease
being of such common occurrence among the ancient
Israelites and Egyptians. This ailment was classed as
unclean, and those afflicted with it were ostracized and
excluded from the church.
Truly it is a disease caused by unsanitary and
unclean habits of living, and only those who, as in the
case of this man, are gluttonous and careless in their
personal habits are afflicted with it. We will use
horoscope 12B to illustrate another phase of this disease. LEPROSY 305 NO. 12B
Male, born March 19, 1896, at 7:50 Plutão .M. D URING the ancient Israelitic times the Jews
looked upon leprosy as a peculiar disease sent
to man by God. It was recognized as a mark of the
displeasure of God for some great sin committed, and it
was considered a dreadful moral disease. The afflicted
ones were separated from others by the priests, who used
ceremonies of purification for the healing of those who
had this unclean disorder.
We see in this horoscope indications of moral
depravity and uncleanliness: We find Saturn retrograde
in Scorpio, the sign which rules the secret parts, the
generative organs. Saturn is square to Mars, which is in
Aquarius, the home of Saturn. Uranus is also retrograde
and in the sign of Scorpio. These three planets, Saturn,
Uranus, and Mars, are in mutual reception, that is, Mars
is in a Saturn sign and Saturn and Uranus are in a
Martian sign. Uranus is parallel to Mars and opposition
the Moon, both Uranus and the Moon being in their
exaltation signs and in angles and fixed signs. These
planets are thus strong both by position and sign;
therefore they are also most powerful in their afflictions.
When Saturn afflicts Mars from Scorpio and Uranus
afflicts Mars and the Moon from this sign of sex, we
may at once diagnose the case as venereal disease, but it 306 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS was of such a malignant nature that it was believed to be
leprosy, for all outward symptoms indicated leprosy. Certain forms of venereal disease go hand in hand
with the dread disease of leprosy. When the blood stream
is poisoned, the glandular system is also affected, which
in turn interferes with the metabolism of the entire body.
The Jews in olden times used no medicine to cure
this unclean disease. They claimed that it withered all LEPROSY 307 desire for grace and spiritual life; therefore the only cure
was prayer and spiritual purification.
In Matthew, 8th chapter, we find: “When he [Christ]
was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
followed him. And, behold, there came a leper and
worshiped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst
make me clean. And Jesus put forth his hand and
touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And
immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” CHAPTER XXIV PARALYSIS
NO. 13A—PARALYSIS
Female, born August 22, 1899, 1:30 Plutão .M. Plutão ARALYSIS of the limbs and arms is the
affliction of this young woman. We note first
that this condition is indicated by the Moon, which is the
particular significator of health for a woman. She is in
Pisces which rules the feet, and square to Saturn, the
planet of obstruction, placed in Sagittarius, the sign
ruling the hips. Thus the whole region of the lower limbs
is afflicted. The Moon is also square to Neptune and the
saturnine Dragon's Tail, which are placed in Gemini, the
sign ruling the arms. The life-giving Sun is square to
Uranus in Sagittarius and to the Ascendant, and these
afflictions are all the more powerful because the Sun and
Moon are both angular, one near the Midheaven, the
other close to the Nadir. Thus there are strong tendencies
to trouble with the arms and limbs, dropsy, paralysis, and
wasting disease shown in the natal horoscope.
These conditions did not become manifest until the
patient was eighteen years of age. At that time the 308 THE NERVES 309 progressed Sun had reached Virgo 16°33’; it was then
square to the radical Saturn. This brought out the latent
weakness and resulted in a gradual loss of control of the limbs, which left her prostrate. Neptune conjunction the
saturnine Dragon's Tail in Gemini, the sign ruling the
lungs, gives an asthmatic condition and the afflicted
Moon in Pisces gives a tendency to dropsical swellings,
which have also manifested. Thus, for the time being, 310 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS she is in the grip of what seems an incurable condition.
But it is noteworthy that the afflictions are all from
common signs, and this gives the astrologer a ray of
hope that when the Sun has passed the critical points the
affliction may be cured and she may regain the use of
both arms and limbs even if not in full measure.
In the meantime every effort should be made to
promote circulation by the manipulation and massage of
the limbs and arms. A diet of fresh milk, which contains
much ether, and uncooked vegetables that will give her
mineral salts is sure to be of great benefit in helping to
keep the limbs in shape and preventing atrophy so that
when the present planetary afflictions have passed, the
sextile of the radical Sun and Jupiter may restore
circulation. This patient can best be treated by a healer
having Aries or Leo rising and whose Saturn is not in
any place included in the degrees of the patient's 1st or
6th houses. THE NERVES 311 NO. 13B—PARALYSIS AND HARDENING OF THE
ARTERIES
Male, born February Mercúrio , 1855, Mercúrio :00 Plutão .M. W E note first the mental qualities of the patient.
The Moon is conjoined with the Dragon's
Tail, a saturnine influence, and Mercury is square to
Saturn. Thus the two significators of mind are afflicted
by an obstructive and melancholy influence, which also
operates upon Mars and Venus through the square of
Saturn. Saturn moreover is placed in the 9th house in the
sign of the lower mind, Gemini. Thus there is very little
joy for this person; all the world looks blue and gloomy
to him; he meets everybody and everything with gloom
and distrust, and is always afraid to make a move in any
direction for fear something is going to happen to him.
This mental attitude is at the bottom of all his
trouble, for no one who carries such thoughts of fear and
worry can ever be healthy. The more cheerful and
optimistic we are, the more we act as magnets for good
things; we become what people call “lucky.” Conversely,
such an attitude as this person has is bound to bring
misfortune and trouble. He thinks he has cause to be
worried, and upon the surface it may appear so, but the
trouble is that he mistakes effect for cause. The first
work of a healer should be to show him this fatal error
and teach him to smile or at least to try to smile. 312 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Just as cheer promotes circulation and elimination,
keeping the body in health, so worry produces concretion
by hindering the elimination of waste matter, and
therefore a diseased condition of the body follows. Three
places in this patient's body are affected by the saturnine influence. In the first place Saturn is in the sign Gemini,
which governs the lungs; he is square Mercury, Mars,
and Venus, and thus he obstructs the expulsion of THE NERVES 313 carbonic acid and prevents the proper oxygenation of the
blood. The Moon has particular rule over the fluids of
the body. She is in the latter part of Scorpio in
conjunction with the Dragon's Tail. Thus we may look
for obstruction of the urine and for concretions in the
bladder. The Sun and Jupiter are in Aquarius. Uranus
squares Jupiter and the Moon squares the Sun. The
effects of these are felt in the opposite sign Leo, which
rules the heart. The Sun is also parallel to Uranus, and
therefore the heart action is very uncertain, the
circulation poor, the blood poisoned and heavy with
waste matter that cannot be eliminated through the
regular channels. So this clings to the walls of the
arteries, and in the course of years the condition known
as hardening of the arteries takes place, and the body
becomes dry and emaciated.
The horoscope is the clock of destiny which marks
the time when tendencies shown at birth are due to
materialize. In August, 1910, the Moon had progressed
to the conjunction of its radical place. This configuration
excited the Moon's radical conjunction with the Dragon's
Tail to action, as well as her square to the radical Sun
and her opposition to Uranus radical. Thus the disease
which had been prepared for during so many years took
a serious turn and commenced to seriously hamper the
native. In January, 1912, the Moon progressed to the
opposition of Saturn radical and squared Mars and
Mercury, thus enlivening and bringing into action the
condition foreshown in the natal chart. Mars and 314 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Mercury govern the nervous system. Mars has rule over
the motor nerves and Mercury over the sensory nerves.
The above progressed affliction obstructed the vital flow
along the nerves and paralyzed the body.
Jupiter was parallel to the Sun's radical place during
1912-14, and the conjunction of the progressed Sun and
Mars in January, 1914, served to give more energy.
These influences should have been taken on the wing.
The patient should have outdoor life, on a farm if
possible, with a diet in which buttermilk has a large part,
and above all the cultivation of a cheerful attitude should
be forced. This with manipulation of the spinal nerves
would probably bring life into the paralyzed limbs and
might restore a fair measure of health under good
progressed aspects. THE NERVES 315 NO. 13C—FACIAL PARALYSIS
Female, born April 13, 1912, Mercúrio :00 A.M. T HIS horoscope is that of a young girl with the
watery and cardinal sign of Cancer on the
eastern angle and with the fiery Mars in conjunction with
the Ascendant. Mars is square to Venus and trine to the
Moon, the Moon being the ruler of the Ascendant. Mars
is the ruler of the 6th house, which has rule over the
health; consequently we must look to Mars as the
indicator of health.
Mars in Cancer afflicted by a square from Venus,
and Venus in the martial sign of Aries, would indicate a
gourmand, one who would as a result of too much rich
and highly seasoned food suffer from indigestion or
inflammation of the stomach.
Neptune in Cancer afflicted by a square from the Sun
and Mercury would be apt to give nervous trouble or
malnutrition. But this young girl has been in the very
best of health, with the digestive organs in good
condition. The conjunction of Mars with the Ascendant
in Cancer and square to Venus has had little effect upon
her health.
The birth of this child was prepared for under the
purest conditions and in the most careful manner. The
parents had prepared for it even before conception, for
they desired to attract to birth an Ego advanced and pure.
During all the prenatal period the mother received the 316 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS greatest care, and the child was loved into this physical
world by advanced and pure parents. She was a most
wonderful child—healthy, happy, far above the average
child of her years, and superior to other children of her
age in mentality. In the summer of 1922 she was taken with frequent
hemorrhages of the nose and with severe headaches. The
best physicians were consulted, who did everything THE NERVES 317 possible to locate the cause, but to no avail. The facial
muscles of the right side began to relax, and facial
paralysis finally set in, greatly disfiguring a beautiful
face. After trying every available method to relieve the
child, the father and mother took her on a touring trip to
southern California, hoping that the seacoast and lower
altitude might relive her, which they did to some extent.
Having read the Rosicrucian books on astrology, and
knowing of our method of healing and diagnosing, they
visited Headquarters with the hope that the writer would
be able to diagnose and help them in their trouble. This
hope was realized. As soon as the aura of the child was
contacted, the writer was impelled to lay the child on her
face and to run her hand over the spinal column.
Although not an osteopath or a chiropractor, she found
irregularity in the region of the upper cervical vertebrae,
also in the center of the dorsal region.
During this, may we call it intuitional or spiritual,
diagnosis the parents were silently watching every move
of the writer, exchanging glances from time to time.
When it was mentioned that the spinal column was
irregular, the father spoke up, saying, “Oh, her spine is
all right.” When asked if she has had an adjustment, he
admitted that both he and his wife were chiropractors
and had practiced for almost two years. When asked if
they had not both practiced on the child, they
shamefacedly admitted that they had, with the result that
the motor nerves had been over-stimulated. 318 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Through the wonderful keyboard, the spinal column
with its thirty-one spinal nerves, a skillful operator can
by manipulation enervate or stimulate almost any part of
the body, while an unskilled one may cause untold
suffering. Such was the case with this beautiful young
girl. The parents who had loved her into existence, who
would have sacrificed their very lives for her, had in
ignorance played once too often on her spinal nerves,
exciting them to work overtime, and after the damage
had been done, they were not skilled enough to know
what method to use to undo the damage.
We take the rulers of the 10th and 4th houses to
indicate the parents. Neptune is the ruler of Pisces, which
is on the Midheaven, and Mercury the ruler of Virgo,
which is on the cusp of the 4th house. The above two
planets are squaring each other. Mars on the Ascendant
indicates accidents, injuries, etc. Mars is square to Venus
in Aries, the head. The cardinal signs act upon each
other. The parts affected by squares such as from Aries,
the head, to Cancer, the stomach, are in mutual bondage
to each other. While the nerves of the stomach may have
been over-stimulated, thereby sending an excess of blood
to the head causing the bleeding of the nose, by a
knowledge of proper adjustments a skilled osteopath or
chiropractor could in a few treatments overcome this
trouble. The Invisible Helpers of the Rose Cross, by
materializing a hand, can also accomplish the same
thing. THE NERVES 319 NO. 13D, 13E—PARALYSIS
Male, born March 25, 1876, 2:00 A.M. W E will use for this lesson the horoscopes of a
man and woman who have afflictions in
common signs, in order to illustrate why one patient will
succumb to disease and become an invalid when another
who has many more afflicting planets rises above them
and thus becomes able to lead an active and useful life.
We will first diagnose horoscope 13D, where we
find the common sign of Sagittarius on the Ascendant
with the ruler, Jupiter, retrograde, and in its own sign in
the 11th house, trine to the life-giving Sun, but square to
the obstructing Saturn, which is in the sign of Pisces,
another common sign. We find the Sun making only
good aspects. The Moon is square the Ascendant and in
conjunction with the Dragon's Head, which has a
Jupiterian influence, sextile to Mars and Venus, and trine
to Jupiter. These configurations should give much
vitality and be a strong factor for health in this
horoscope. Now why should a man with so few
afflictions have become an invalid?
We find only two afflictions which would be
detrimental to health; these are Saturn square Jupiter, and
Venus conjunction Mars in Taurus square to Uranus in
Leo. But with the common sign on the Ascendant this
man's will was not strong enough to withstand the
temptations shown by Venus conjunction Mars in 320 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Taurus, the larynx (Taurus also represents the generative
organs by opposition from Scorpio), and square to
Uranus. Dissipation in food and drink filled the blood with impurities, which impaired the arterial circulation.
Saturn in a common sign, square to Jupiter, also in a
common sign, Sagittarius, which has rule over the sacral
region, shows that the fifth lumbar nerve and the sacral
nerves were obstructed in their function. Naturally this
interfered with the circulation in that part of the body, THE NERVES 321 causing paralysis of the lower limbs. The common-sign
man naturally follows the line of least resistance and
drifts into invalidism.
Now horoscope No. 13E, that of a woman, has the
fixed sign of Leo rising, and Mars is on the cusp of the Ascendant. But in this case we find the ruler, the Sun,
also the Moon, both afflicted by the opposition of
Neptune and the square of Uranus. Venus, which has
rule over the venous circulation, is in the common sign 322 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS of Virgo, square to the obstructing Saturn in Sagittarius,
the home of Jupiter, Sagittarius also ruling the sacral
region. A native with the dynamic Mars on the
Ascendant in the fixed and impulsive sign of Leo is full
of energy and ambition, and would naturally use up
much strength and through temper and impulse dissipate
much of her vitality. With the circulation restricted in the
sacral region by Saturn, why should this woman not
suffer with conditions similar to those of the man in
horoscope No. 13D?
In the man's horoscope we find conditions indicating
a phlegmatic, mentally lazy person. With Moon and
Mercury in conjunction in Pisces and sextile to Venus
and Mars, and with Jupiter trine Sun, everything came to
him without any great effort. Especially was he drawn to
5th, 7th, and 10th house people—musical, theatrical
people and movie actors, who led him into a life of
pleasure. We find the woman in horoscope No. 3E with
plenty of will and ambition, whose desire to heal and
help humanity led her to take up the medical profession.
But she had a constant fight to keep her joints from
becoming stiff and sore. With Saturn obstructing the
circulation in the sacral region she suffered greatly with
granulated joints of the shoulders, hips and feet. Venus
or Jupiter afflicted from common signs gives a tendency
to paralysis of the limbs, but with a fixed sign on the
Ascendant the native will not succumb. Therefore it is
most necessary at all times when diagnosing a disease to THE NERVES 323 observe the rising sign and the aspects of the Sun, Moon,
and the ruler of the Ascendant.
One who suffers from such afflictions as the above
should make an effort to keep the circulation normal by
eating very lightly of plain food, exercising plentifully,
and with a pair of bath mitts rubbing the limbs briskly
morning and night. This will often avert a case of
paralysis. NO. 13F—INFANTILE PARALYSIS
Male, born July 7, 1908, 2:00 A.M. W E will here examine the sympathetic aspects
of planets in the cardinal signs. We find in
this horoscope a most interesting lesson illustrating the
sympathy and antipathy of the planets when placed in
signs which are square or in opposition to each other.
The horoscope of this young man has the common
sign of Gemini on the Ascendant, with Mercury, Venus,
Neptune, the Sun, Mars, and the Dragon's Head all in
Cancer, the sign which has rule over the stomach. Four
of these planets, namely, Mercury, Venus, Neptune, and
the Sun are in opposition to Uranus and square to Saturn.
The Sun is parallel to Uranus and Neptune; Neptune,
Uranus, and the Sun are square to the Moon in Libra in
the 6th house. 324 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS From our first observation we might diagnose this
case as one of stomach trouble, for with Venus in
conjunction with Mercury, Neptune, and the Sun
afflicted in Cancer we may expect poor digestion. When
Neptune is one of the afflicters, especially when it in turn is afflicted by Saturn, there is a tendency to
underdevelopment. The organs affected are often
undersized and misshapen. With Saturn square Neptune THE NERVES 325 and Uranus, Uranus being in the sign of Capricorn,
which is in opposition to the sign ruling the stomach, this
child could not digest its food, which was often found in
the stool in pieces. The parents, being ignorant of the
cause of the condition, were indulgent and permitted him
at the age of two years to eat whatever he craved. As a
small child he was given solid food to eat.
With Neptune in the sign of the stomach, square
Saturn, and in opposition to Uranus, the tiny glands
which secrete the gastric juice of the stomach and which
are so necessary to furnish the lubricating mucus as well
as the digestive fluid, were lacking in vitality and prone
to function spasmodically—for Uranus causes spasmodic
action, Saturn sluggish action, and Neptune undersize or
abnormal functioning. Therefore we would expect that
the blood in this case would not receive due nourishment
from the food. The body, as a result, would be deprived
of the elements necessary for nourishment.
The damage in such cases generally materializes
where the planet is placed which has the most evil
aspects. Here we find Uranus in Capricorn making
several adverse aspects as noted above. Uranus is
receiving no help whatever from other planets; therefore
naturally we may expect the place of such an afflicted
planet to be the focusing point of the vicious circle.
Capricorn has rule over the legs and joints, especially the
knee joints. At the age of two years this boy was
afflicted with what the doctors call infantile paralysis,
which caused him to lose the use of his feet. Infantile 326 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS paralysis is a disease which is diagnosed by the doctors
as inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord but
this has not been proven. Some of them are in doubt
about this, and are seeking for another cause.
No two children have the same effects from this
infantile disease. From an astrological standpoint no two
who are afflicted with it have exactly the same planetary
afflictions or necessarily the same rising sign. The writer
has found in seven horoscopes of children afflicted with
it that Neptune has been the chief afflicter in each case.
As stated in The Message of the Stars, Neptune has rule
over the spinal fluids and the pineal gland, and it
depends upon the planet which is afflicting Neptune as to
how the disease expresses itself. This naturally baffles
the doctors, and they are unable to explain why one child
is left with one paralyzed leg, another with both legs and
arms paralyzed, and still another with one side entirely
useless. But the planets tell the reason for this diversity
of outward expression. THE NERVES 327 NO. 13G—RICKETS AND TETANY
Female, born January 6th, 1911, 8:20 Plutão .M. W E have here the horoscope of a young girl
who has the common sign of Virgo on the
Ascendant, with the Sun in the fifth house in Capricorn.
We are told in The Message of the Stars, page 544, that
the Sun rules the vital fluid which is drawn into the body
through the spleen and how this life-giving fluid feeds
the entire organism. The Sun is afflicted in this case by
an opposition of Neptune, which is placed in the sign of
Cancer. Cancer has rule over the stomach. The Sun is
also afflicted by a parallel of Mars and Uranus. We here
may see that the gateway of the body through which the
solar force must needs enter in order to make it possible
for the vital body to restore what the desire body
destroys, has not worked normally even from birth.
When the Sun is afflicted by the spasmodic Uranus, the
cramping effect of Neptune, and the inflammatory
conditions of the fiery Mars, we may expect that at some
time during the life of the native, when nature's laws
have been broken and when the progressed planets start
the afflictions into action, there will be trouble.
In the beginning of the year 1923 the progressed
Moon was passing through the sign of Virgo and made a
square to the radical Mars in Sagittarius. This disturbed
the metabolism of the digestive tract, which on account
of the resulting inflammation was unable to furnish the 328 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS blood with the proper amount of mineral salts. This
combined with the disturbed solar force caused by an
afflicted Sun deprived the bones and the muscles of their nourishment. In January 1923 the new Moon fell in
conjunction with the radical Venus, Uranus, and
Mercury, square to Saturn, and opposition to Neptune.
This excited the latent condition caused by Neptune in
Cancer, the Sun, Uranus, Venus, and Mercury in THE NERVES 329 Capricorn, and the malefic Saturn in Aries making a
square to the last three planets. Added to all these
afflictions Mars radical is parallel to Uranus, Neptune,
Venus and the Sun. Do we wonder that this young girl
was afflicted with the dread disease of rickets, which is a
malady in which the bones are lacking in mineral matter,
and with tetany, which is a disease causing a nervous
contraction of the muscles of the extremities?
Had the parents known the tendencies in this
horoscope when the child was quite young and carefully
chosen her food so that she would have received the
greatest possible amount of nourishment from the
smallest possible amount of it, avoiding the excessive
use of sugar, starches, and proteins, and had they used
more of nature's pure, green vegetables, they might have
helped her to build better bones and muscles.
Unfortunately many of our northern countries do not
have the pure green food all the year round such as we
have here in sunny California, where it may be found in
abundance twelve months in the year.
In prescribing a diet for the patient suffering from
the above malady we would eliminate all heavy proteins,
giving her plenty of pure fresh goat's milk, carrots,
lettuce, onions, and spinach, adding a very small amount
of entire wheat bread each day to give bulk. Let her lie in
the sunshine as much as possible; especially should the
sun shine upon the spine. Give her friction rubs, which
will stimulate the circulation. 330 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS CHAPTER XXV
THE NERVES
NO. 14A, 14B—NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AND
PARALYSIS I N order to illustrate to the student why the same
disease will leave different aftereffects we will use
two horoscopes. These two charts prove the claim which
we have always made: that there is no more perfect way
of diagnosing the disease of a patient, nothing more
reliable, than astro-diagnosis.
Both patients have called upon the Invisible Helpers
for healing, and both have been sufferers from that dread
disease which has taken so many lives all over the world
and has claimed more victims than did the world war, the
disease which the doctors call influenza, or for short, the
“flu.”
NO. 14A
Male, born June 3rd, 1855, 2:00 A.M. H ERE we have the ambitious, fiery sign of Aries
on the Ascendant, with the Sun in the restless,
nervous sign of Gemini in the house of finances, in THE NERVES 331 conjunction with the persevering, tactful, thrifty,
grasping Saturn. The ruler of the horoscope, Mars, is in
the last degree of Taurus, square to Jupiter. Jupiter has
great love for finance. He likes it and therefore can do great things with it. He is large and benevolent in all his
ways. We find that this man had a great desire for
wealth, and after having had influenza he put such a
strain upon his physical body in order to gain wealth that 332 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS he brought about a nervous condition from which he is
now suffering. He has the restless Moon in the
Midheaven trine to the irresponsible and inventive
Uranus, giving a great desire for speculation and to
engage in get-rich-quick schemes. But Neptune, the
planet dealing with large corporations and speculation, is
square to the Sun and Saturn in the 2nd house, showing
that he has always been speculating with large
corporations and always losing.
Venus in Cancer in the 4th house in opposition to the
Moon in the Midheaven gives an extravagant, frivolous,
slothful, and dissolute condition in the home, indicating
that money is wasted and used very foolishly, giving the
native even greater desire to make money. He sacrificed
his vitality for the almighty dollar. Being a telegraph
operator, he used the brain and the fingers tips to excess,
which caused inadequate nutrition of the nervous system.
The result was a complete nervous breakdown. THE NERVES 333 NO. 14B
Male, born April 15, 1865, 8:22 A.M. W ITH the nervous sign Gemini rising and the
restless, unconventional Uranus on the
Ascendant in opposition to Jupiter, ruler of the arterial
blood, this man was an easy prey to pneumonia, as the
capillaries of the lungs were contracted, which made
oxygenation spasmodic.
The Sun, the life-giver, we find in the 11th house in
Aries, in opposition to the retrograde Saturn in Libra.
Saturn is in his exaltation in Libra and very powerful.
We would ordinarily look for the greatest trouble in the
corresponding part of the body. This man would some
time have suffered with renal disorder as the body was
very sluggish and charged with impurities and the
kidneys had not been eliminating properly for a number
of years. He has always been a hearty eater. With Mars
in Cancer square to Neptune, he has been very
immoderate and abnormal in the indulgence of his
appetite, also too fond of liquids.
The planets frequently work in opposites. In this
case we find that the sign Aries is the seat of the
principal trouble. This man was paralyzed after the
effects of pneumonia were overcome.
We can see the difference between these two men.
14A is more able to overcome disease, having the fiery,
ambitious sign of Aries on the Ascendant. He has better
circulation for he has Mercury and Jupiter trine. 14B has 334 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the restless, emotional Uranus in Gemini on the
Ascendant badly afflicted, and it is very difficult for him
to remain quiet and calm. His emotions constantly carry him to excesses and extremes. Both should be put on a
strict diet, for they have indulged too freely in the good
things of the table. It should consist principally of
vegetables, including raw onions, parsley, and celery.
14A is suffering from a complete nervous
breakdown, while 14B is paralyzed. THE NERVES 335 NO. 14C, 14D—DEFECTIVE WALK A PAIR of most interestingly similar charts, both
in aspects and symptoms, will now be
considered. We will first take figure No. 14C, that of a
boy born November 25, 1899, 0:30 A.M.
We find the vacillating and negative Moon in the
12th house near the Ascendant, as the ruler of the
horoscope. This planet is square to the Sun and Uranus.
These last two planets are in conjunction in Sagittarius,
the sign which has rule over the hips, the sacral region of
the spine, and the coccygeal region. Sagittarius also has
rule over the iliac arteries and veins, sciatic nerves, and
locomotor muscles in hips and thighs. We also find Mars
in this sign of the hips, in conjunction with Venus,
Mercury, and Saturn. Venus rules the venous blood, and
wherever this planet is placed and afflicted, the
circulation in that part of the body is impeded. Mars
burns up while Saturn restricts, contracts, and dries up.
So we find that the circulation is interfered with by these
two afflicting planets, and as Mercury rules the nerves
we might expect that this boy would suffer from
restrictions in the region of the hips. Neptune, the higher
octave of Mercury, works upon the nervous system and
rules the spinal canal. In this horoscope Neptune is
placed in the 10th house in an angle where his power is
greater than when placed in a cadent or succedent house.
We also find him in the sign of Mercury (Gemini) which
rules the upper spinal nerves. As Neptune is in 336 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS opposition to Venus, Mercury, and Saturn, and parallel
with Saturn, Mars, and Uranus, through this planet which
has so many aspects and the greater number of them
afflictions, we can locate the seat of the trouble—
obstruction in the nervous system and spinal fluids. This boy has never been able to walk without
staggering like a drunken man. Gemini being the sign of
speech, and Mercury the planet ruling speech, Neptune
in Gemini has prevented him from learning to use the THE NERVES 337 faculty of speech. With the Moon, the life ruler, afflicted
in Virgo (the Moon having rule over the white fluids of
the body, and Mercury, the small intestine), it will be
doubtful whether this young man can overcome these
afflictions, for a negative sign is rising and the afflictions
from angles are stronger than the will of the patient.
NO. 14D
The second figure, that of a young man born March
17, 1900, 1:00 A.M., has the energetic sign of Sagittarius
on the Ascendant with Jupiter, the life ruler, in its own
sign in the 12th house, in conjunction with the nervous
and erratic Uranus, which is co-ruler of the horoscope.
These two planets are also in conjunction with the
Dragon's Head, which is of a Jupiterian nature. They are
afflicted by a square of Mars, from the sign Pisces, also a
parallel of Neptune and Saturn. With these afflictions of
Jupiter ruling the arterial blood, in the two Jupiterian
signs, Sagittarius (hips) and Pisces (the feet), what may
we expect but that the arterial blood would be obstructed
in the limbs? As the action of Uranus is spasmodic, it
shows that at certain times only does this young man
suffer with cramping of the motor nerves. But we find
Saturn, the planet of obstruction, strong in its own sign
of Capricorn, ruling the knees, afflicted by the square of
the Moon from near the Midheaven, also by the square
of Mercury in Aries. As the joints of the body are largely
ruled by the sign Capricorn, especially when Saturn is 338 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS placed in this sign and afflicted, we may expect a lack of
power in and control of the lower part of the body. We find Neptune, the planet ruling the spinal canal
and the spinal spirit fire, square to the life-giving Sun.
This aspect acts upon the body as a disconnected wire
would upon a telephone; there would be no response.
The vital fluids cannot flow freely through the spinal
column; and the upper and lower part of the body may be
likened to two disconnected wires. This boy, like the first THE NERVES 339 one, could not walk without the support of crutches; but
this affliction was very slight until he reached the age of
seven years when the progressed Moon reached the
conjunction of the radical Saturn; then he lost entire
control of his limbs.
We are told in Galatians, 6th chapter, 7th verse, that
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. The
question might be asked, “How could these poor young
men be held responsible for something that came upon
them as babes?” We are told that this life is not all, that
we have lived many lives, and that we are born to parent
with whom we have made ties in previous lives. They
are the instruments through which we are to receive our
lessons. As we look into the lives of these poor souls we
see this exemplified. They have been attracted to parents
who could give them certain bodies, the archetype of
which they themselves were the builders. We note in
Horoscope No. 14C that Neptune is in the 10th house,
opposition Saturn, Venus, and Mercury in the 4th house,
indicating lewdness and drunkenness of both parents;
while in No. 14D the Moon is afflicted in the 9th house
by an opposition of Mercury, and Saturn in square to
both Mercury and Moon, indicating a drunken father and
a nervous and neurasthenic mother.
May the poor boys born into these miserably
afflicted bodies learn their lessons, as afflictions are to
the soul what fire is to gold—a refiner. Surely the
experiences in this life will bring them much purification
and soul growth. 340 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 14E—EXAGGERATED HYSTERIA
Female, born December 5th, 1873, 8:45 Plutão .M. T HIS horoscope has the positive, vital, and fixed
sign of Leo on the Ascendant, with the ruler, the
Sun, in the fifth house in Sagittarius. The Moon and
Saturn are very strong in their own home signs. Saturn,
the planet of obstruction, is in Capricorn in the sixth
house, the house of sickness. We usually look to such a
planet and its position for the key to the trouble. Saturn
is square to the retrograde planet Neptune, which is in
conjunction with the Midheaven and in the impulsive
sign of Aries. Neptune is the higher octave of Mercury; it
is in the ninth house, ruling the higher mind. In such a
case we may expect to find brain storms or some
abnormal mental trouble.
The Moon is in its own sign, Cancer, square to
Jupiter. Therefore the native can expect little help from
the Moon, and so we must look to the planet Mercury to
see if the mind is to receive assistance to overcome the
square of Neptune to Saturn. Mercury is retrograde,
which makes its influence latent, and in the sign of its
fall, the common sign of Sagittarius. Mercury, however,
while weak by sign and retrograde, is helped by a sextile
of Jupiter and by one of Saturn. This will save the native
from insanity.
Uranus, the planet of impulse, is retrograde and in
the impulsive sign of Leo, in conjunction with the THE NERVES 341 Ascendant and in opposition to the fiery Mars. Mars and
Uranus are in angles, the first and seventh houses, and
have a tendency to cause spells of temper and spasmodic
emotions. This causes irregularity of the action of the
heart. Neptune in Aries square to Saturn causes the mind to
become very selfish, and from childhood this native has
demanded that others grant her every wish. She would 342 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS throw herself into a spasm in order to get what she
wanted from her parents. This habit grew upon her, and
when she reached the age of menopause, she had no
control whatever over her emotions. The doctors
diagnosed her case as exaggerated hysteria.
As the progressed Sun neared the conjunction with
the radical Mars and the opposition to the radical
Uranus, heart trouble developed as a result of the strain
which she had put upon her body all through life by
these selfish spells. With Neptune in Aries, square to
Saturn, she is lacking in mental control and allows the
emotional Uranus and Mars to entirely rule her life.
Here is a case where the parents were much to blame
by permitting her as a child to have her own way. If they
had controlled her in these spells in the beginning, even
though it had necessitated severe methods and caused the
clashing of wills, it would have helped her to get mastery
over the emotions. But as it is they permitted her to have
her way, which has caused her untold suffering and may
bring a fatal ending.
This is a case in which the patient precipitated her
trouble through violent actions. There is no reason
whatever for poor health with only three afflictions,
namely, Saturn square Neptune and the Midheaven,
Uranus in conjunction with the Ascendant and in
opposition to Mars, and Jupiter square the Moon; while
there are 15 good aspects in the horoscope, including the
parallels and the sextile of the Sun to Mars, and fixed
and cardinal signs are on the angles. It may well be said THE NERVES 343 that this woman is digging her own grave. Think of the
archetype which she is laying the foundation for to be
used in her next embodiment! Can it be wondered at that
some souls are born with chronic and incurable diseases? NO. 14F—OBSTRUCTION OF THE
PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE
Female, born April Júpiter , 1915, 5 Plutão .M. I N this horoscope we have the common sign of
Virgo on the Ascendant, common signs on the
four angles, and the afflicting planets are posited in the
common signs. As a rule planetary afflictions from these
weaker signs are more easily overcome than from
cardinal or fixed signs, but when the patient also has
common signs on the four angles he will not make the
effort necessary to overcome planetary conditions.
We find the Sun in the martial and impulsive sign of
Aries, sextile to Uranus. This latter planet is strong in its
own sign of Aquarius. The Moon is in the restless sign of
Sagittarius, and the ruler of the Ascendant, Mercury, is
in conjunction with the fiery and impulsive Mars. The
positions of these various planets will give this child a
most impulsive, restless, and ambitious nature, one
which will keep her on the go constantly, and whatever
she does will be done in a quick and impulsive manner. 344 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A lack of self-control is shown. She will eat hurriedly,
failing to give proper attention to the mastication of her food. This hurry and impulse will have a bad effect, for
Mercury ruling the nervous system, conjunction Mars
and square to the Moon and the destructive Saturn, will
cause the nervous organization to become deranged each
time that the native gives way to great excitement, anger, THE NERVES 345 excesses in eating, or anything which might produce a
strain on the nerves.
The Moon has rule over the esophagus and stomach,
and Saturn, which is posited strongly in the Midheaven,
has rule over the pneumogastric nerve. Saturn is in
opposition to the Moon, hence we may expect trouble
from the branches of pneumogastric or vagus nerve. The
two divisions of this great nerve, the esophageal and the
gastric branches, are obstructed in their functions by
Saturn, and this interferes with peristaltic action. The
sluggish action of the esophagus and the cardiac orifice
cause the food to move too slowly through this tube
before it reaches the stomach, and then it remains too
long a time in the stomach before it is digested, for
Saturn causes a sluggish condition of these organs. This
may result in great distress.
This girl suffered intensely with stomach trouble
once every six or eight days, the time varying. These
spells may be traced to the effect of the transiting Moon
as it passed through the common signs, forming the
conjunction, opposition, or square of the planets in these
signs. The Moon transiting over its radical place in
Sagittarius, over Mercury, Jupiter, and Mars in Pisces,
and over Saturn in Gemini will bring these afflicted
periods once a week.
The parents consulted a number of doctors, each one
giving a different diagnosis. One physician was positive
of cancer and wanted to operate. Between these spells of 346 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS stomach trouble the girl seemed to be in fairly good
health.
In a case of this kind, undue excitement and all
excesses should be avoided at the time of the Moon's
transits over the afflicted planets. Caution in the choice
of food should be exercised. All coarse foods which are
hard to digest should be avoided, and everything that is
eaten should be well masticated before it enters the
esophageal tube. CHAPTER XXVI
THE BONES
NO. 15A—INJURY TO FEMUR
Male, born November 11, 1886, 6:36 A.M. S AGITTARIUS 24°24’ is on the Ascendant in the
present instance and the inflammatory and
destructive Mars, the planet of impulse, is on the cusp of
the Ascendant in the pleasure-loving and heedless sign
of Sagittarius. This man was especially fond of horses.
Mercury is in the 12th house in Sagittarius, sextile to the
impulsive Uranus in the 11th house of friends, which
shows a desire for swift action, racing, fast driving, etc.
Mars, the ruler of the fifth house, which has rule over
pleasures, is sextile Jupiter. This young man met with
accident caused by horses.
We find that at the age of 21 years the boy's
progressed Sun and Venus were in conjunction with the
radical Mercury and sextile to Uranus, the progressed
Mars having just passed the square to Uranus, and
reached the sextile to Venus, indicating a most
pleasurable time with friends. But the progressed Moon
was in square aspect to the radical Neptune, sextile to
Mars, and opposition the Midheaven. This brought about 347 348 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS an accident, the young man being thrown from a horse.
From this he never recovered, the lower limbs becoming
paralyzed as a result. He was rarely free from pain, and
in 1916 the doctors removed part of the femur of the
right leg, for the fall had bruised the bone and it had
rotted. We find Saturn in the 8th house in Cancer square to
Jupiter, which is the ruler of the Ascendant. The Moon is
in its exaltation sign of Taurus, ruling the palate, and in THE BONES 349 the fifth house, hence there was a desire for drink. From
the indications in the 11th house of friends, he was
wined and dined until he had his body over-charged with
ash. Now when this is the case and the boy is unable to
take care of the excess of rich food, the toxic products
settle in the weakest place. With Jupiter afflicted in
Libra, which has rule over the kidneys, these organs
were overworked and not able to eliminate the toxins and
poisonous matter. The bruised femur naturally was the
point which attracted this toxic poison, and
decomposition necessarily took place.
After a number of operations the native passed out in
June, 1918, when the progressed Sun was nearing a
conjunction with the Ascendant and the progressed
Moon was in Cancer in conjunction with Saturn in the
8th house of death. Also the progressed Mars was then
within one degree of an opposition to Saturn.
Now had this young man been in touch with a
physician who could have properly adjusted the
misplaced femur and who would have placed him on a
strict vegetarian diet, eliminating all meats and highly
seasoned food in order to keep the blood pure, there
would have been great possibilities that the life might
have been prolonged and that he would not have become
paralyzed. But unfortunately he was in a small town in
far-off New Zealand where proper aid could not be
obtained. The dislocated and bruised bone was
neglected, and the diet was largely composed of flesh
foods, as vegetables were very scarce there at that time. 350 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 15B—ARTHRITIC MUSCULAR ATROPHY
Female, Born December 4th, 1899, at 8 Plutão .M. T HIS young woman has the watery sign of
Cancer on the Ascendant, with the Sun in the
common sign of Sagittarius.
It is the rule when looking for physical ailments to
take the ruler of the 6th house, which rules sickness, and
find the position of this planet and its aspects. In this
horoscope we find 28 degrees of Sagittarius on the cusp
of the 6th house, but the influence of this sign is almost
spent before reaching this house. We therefore consider
Capricorn, the sign on the 7th house, with 28 degrees on
the cusp. The greater part of this sign is thus thrown into
the 6th house; therefore we may consider Saturn as
having rule over the house of sickness.
We find this disturbing and crystallizing planet in
24°37’ Sagittarius in conjunction with the inflammatory
Mars and in opposition to Neptune and the Dragon's
Tail. We are told on page 566 of The Message of the
Stars that Neptune rules the spinal gas, or spinal fluid as
the doctors call it. We find Neptune in conjunction with
the Dragon's Tail in the sign of Gemini, which has rule
over the arms and the region of the 6th and 7th cervical
and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dorsal vertebrae. We find Mars
and Saturn in the region of the lower end of the spine,
the sacral or Sagittarian region. Saturn, when afflicted by
Neptune, gives very deep-seated disease, that which is THE BONES 351 difficult to understand. Saturn when afflicted also dries
up the synovial fluid of the joints wherever he may be
posited. When in conjunction with Mars in the sacral
region we may expect trouble, for Mars is hot and
inflammatory and Saturn is cold and moist, with a
restricting influence. We also find Uranus, the Sun, and Mercury in
conjunction and parallel in this same part of the body,
namely the sacral or Sagittarian region. Wherever we 352 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS find two hot, fiery planets such as the Sun and Mars, we
may expect that much of the heat and vitality of the body
will be brought to this region, and when the restricting
influence of Saturn is opposed to the abnormal and
ossifying influence of an afflicted Neptune in the
opposite region—namely the upper end of the spinal
column, both exerting a harmful influence—we may
liken the spinal fluid of the patient to a stream of water
which has been dammed at both ends. No fresh water is
allowed to flow in, and the old and stagnant water must
remain and become polluted. As the greater number of
afflictions are to be found in the sacral region, naturally
the greater amount of impurity is also lodged there.
This young girl developed arthritis of the hip joints
at a very early age, partly on account of the neglect of
the parents, who were very inharmonious. The father
was a drunkard and libertine and the mother careless and
neglectful of her home duties, spending most of her time
away from home and leaving three little girls to shift for
themselves. It was never definitely known whether the
beginning of this disease was due to an accident, but the
stars indicate a fall, which no doubt bruised the hip bone
or the sacral bones and was probably the first cause of
the disease. Gradually the right leg atrophied, and the
spine became bent.
In 1917 this girl called on Headquarters for the
healing of her hand injured in an accident. Here we may
again note the influence of Mars and Saturn in
conjunction, which had their effect in the opposite sign, THE BONES 353 Gemini, and caused the breaking of one of the fingers.
The bone became affected, and the doctors were unable
to do anything to heal it. With the help of the Invisible
Helpers, however, and a strict vegetarian diet she
recovered. But the native has inherited tainted blood
from the father, in conjunction with Saturn and in
opposition to Neptune, which would indicate the
affliction of the father, namely, the dread disease
gonorrhea. Parents with this disease frequently attract
souls for rebirth who must needs suffer from spinal
diseases, blindness, etc. “The mills of God grind slowly,
but they grind exceeding small.” 354 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 15C
OSTEOMYELITIS—INFLAMMATION OF
MARROW OF BONE
Male, born January Mercúrio , 1898, 8:00 A.M. T HIS lesson is based on the horoscope of a man
who has the fixed sign of Aquarius on the
Ascendant, and fixed signs on all the angles indicating a
nature that has the will strongly developed. And with the
Sun in the Saturnian sign of Capricorn there is indication
that he has great persistence in resisting disease.
How well he has succeeded in his fight is shown by
the aspect between the Sun and Mars, which often shows
the extent of the damage which may have been done to
the physical body. Any aspect between Mars and the
Sun, even though it be a square or an opposition, is better
than no aspect. Strong signs on the angles and the Sun in
a determined sign is an indication of power to overcome
physical restrictions. But in this case the Sun is void of
aspects to Mars showing that the disease has mastery
over the man.
Mars, which is exalted in Capricorn, is in
conjunction with Venus, square to Jupiter, and elevated
in the 11th house, indicating liability to accidents. Mars
in the 11th house also shows that friends would be
responsible for leading him into danger. THE BONES 355 We find a very prominent Uranus in this horoscope,
which is near the cusp of the Midheaven, in conjunction
with Saturn, sextile to Jupiter, and trine the Moon,
indicating one who wishes to shine, to be a good fellow
among his friends; also one who would go to extremes in
entertaining them. Uranus in Sagittarius shows impulse
which finds expression through sports, particularly in
connection with four-footed animals. Saturn rules the
bones. 356 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS In 1917 the progressed Mars had reached a
conjunction and a parallel of the radical Sun, which is in
19°21’ of Capricorn in the 12th house, the house of selfundoing. At the same time the progressed Venus was in
parallel to the radical Saturn and Uranus. This indicates
that during the year 1917, while with friends and horses,
this man sustained an injury to one of the bones of the
leg, which although at the time seemed but a bad bruise,
nevertheless was a deep-seated injury. We will see now
how clearly and precisely the clock of destiny registers
events. On December 3, 1918, there was an eclipse of the
Sun in 10°31’ of Sagittarius, conjunct this man's radical
Saturn. The effect of an eclipse lasts during all the year
which follows. In 1919 we find the progressed Sun
conjunct the Ascendant, progressed Venus opposition to
the radical Moon, and progressed Mars conjunct the
radical Sun. We have here three afflictions during the
year following the eclipse, and when the transiting Moon
on June 5, 1919, fell in square to the place of the eclipse,
at the same time making a square to the radical Uranus
and Saturn, the young man was taken with severe pains
in the right ankle, followed by chills and fever. From that
time the leg began to swell and a large abscess formed,
which was lanced by the doctor. As soon as one abscess
healed another would form and in eight months he had
been operated on for abscesses at least ten times. By
1920 pus began to run from small holes in the ankle and
the doctors diagnosed the disease as “osteomyelitis.” THE BONES 357 On April 26th, 1924, this man again entered the
hospital for an operation, and at this time small pieces of
bone were chipped away for seven inches up the leg.
In August 1924, when he called upon Headquarters
for healing, he was returning to the hospital for another
operation.
It is unfortunate that many doctors do not realize that
operations or removals of parts of the body will never
permanently cure so long as the patient is not put on a
proper diet.
The writer visited a friend in a hospital a short time
ago who was severely injured in an automobile accident.
While she was strictly a vegetarian and disliked meat,
the doctors compelled her to eat plentifully of meats and
broths while her wounds were healing.
In the horoscope of this young man under
consideration we find Venus conjunction Mars in a
Saturnian sign, and square to Jupiter. Venus and Mars
are the rulers of the 4th and 10th houses, indicating the
parents, from whom he had inherited scrofulous blood.
So we may realize that no matter how many bones the
doctors may remove from his limb, the real disease,
which is in the blood, can only be cured by the strictest
vegetarian or fruit diet. CHAPTER XXVII SPIRIT CONTROL
NO. 16A—SPIRIT CONTROL
Male, born April 27, 1868, 6:37 Plutão .M. I N the horoscope before us we consider first the
mental qualities as shown in particular by
Mercury and the Moon. Mercury has three aspects: the
conjunction with its higher octave Neptune, which
occurs in Aries, the sign of the head; a sextile to Venus
in the Mercurial sign Gemini; and a square to the Moon
in Cancer. We also note that Mercury goes before the
Sun. This shows a kindly disposition and fairly good
reasoning ability, though the native will not employ the
ordinary processes of reasoning, but will use the
Neptunian method in all his mental operations.
The Moon in the ninth house in the psychic sign
Cancer, its home sign, and in conjunction with Uranus,
gives marked intuition. Saturn in Sagittarius, the 9th
house sign, trine to Jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius, will
help to bring order into the native's thoughts, with the
result that he will be much more balanced than 358 SPIRIT CONTROL 359 inspirational people usually are. Nevertheless he will
always stand out from the crowd, for he is marked as a
dreamer. Uranus and the Moon conjoined in the 9th
house, the house of the higher mind, will overrule
everything else. But the other configurations bearing on
this matter save him from becoming foolish and a butt
for jokes. With respect to his health, we note first that the ruler
of Aries is near the cusp of the 6th house in conjunction 360 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS with Neptune. Neptune makes a conjunction with
Mercury, which will make this man very sensitive and
irritable, offsetting in that respect at times what we said
concerning the kindly disposition denoted by Mercury
sextile to Venus. The Moon and Uranus in Cancer, the
sign which governs the stomach, shows that it will be
very difficult to please him with respect to food, and the
square of Mars to this configuration shows that he is
likely to have gastric trouble when the resistance of the
system in broken down. Strong drink will be craved, and
if this desire is indulged, the psychic experiences of
delirium are inevitable.
Spirit controls are very apt to take possession of the
body of such a person even apart from drink because the
square of the Moon and Uranus to Neptune and Mars
favors such a condition, and temporary insanity at least
is liable to occur.
Part of these statements have already been realized,
for this patient has applied to Headquarters for relief
from unwelcome attention of spirits which he had
attracted at spiritualistic seances. He rebelled very much
against the diet which was prescribed for him and could
not be made to keep up the weekly letters. There is
considerable hope, however, from the Sun sextile to the
Moon and Uranus, that the Ego will ultimately free itself
from outside influences, though this will naturally cause
the native a great deal more trouble than if he had
remained on the healing list until cured, instead of doing
as he has done and as so many do. SPIRIT CONTROL 361 The moment such people feel the slightest relief they
think there is no need for further help from others. That
is not a bad attitude to take because upon the Path of
Attainment it is continually held up as an ideal that “if
thou art Christ, help thyself.” There are too many leaners
who do not wish to bear their responsibility, who shirk it
whenever they can, who are always applying for help
whenever they have even a toothache. Some have even
telegraphed because of a headache and other ridiculously
small ailments. Therefore it is always best to encourage
patients to help themselves as soon as it is possible, for
in that way they gain spiritually even if physically their
progress is slower.
In a case of this nature the simplest diet should be
prescribed in order to soothe the nerves: lettuce if it is at
all obtainable, and onions in the evening in any case.
Such a diet, and exercises to limber up the spine,
particularly in the lumbar region where Saturn in
Sagittarius has a grip on the sciatic nerves, will in time
restore such a patient to health, provided he avoids liquor
and stays away from spiritualistic seances. 362 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 16B—OBSESSION—TONSILS
Female, born August 17, 1881, at Mercúrio A.M. T HIS horoscope is that of a woman who has the
sign of Libra on the Ascendant, with cardinal
signs on all four angles. The Sun in the positive and
fixed sign of Leo indicates that she will have
determination well developed. This determination,
however, may be expressed in the form of stubbornness,
for Mercury is in Leo in the 10th house, square Saturn
and Neptune, these last two planets being in the fixed
and stubborn sign of Taurus. The squares of the above
three planets—Saturn, Neptune, and Mercury—are from
the natural Capricorn or Saturnian 10th house, which is a
dominant position, to the 8th house, which is the natural
Scorpio or Mars house. So we may expect that this
woman will be very fixed in nature and determined to
follow her own inclinations.
Her ideals or desires should have been expressed
through Venus in Cancer, conjunction the Midheaven.
Venus is sextile to Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus and
parallel to the Moon and Mars. This gives talent for art
or music, also a love for dress and display, and Venus
being ruler of the Ascendant, it should also give a sweet
personality coupled with beauty of face and figure.
According to the diagnosis of psychoanalysis this
woman during the years of adolescence, when the life
forces were welling up and the latent talents were SPIRIT CONTROL 363 seeking a means of expression, which would naturally be
through art and music, was not finding her field. Her
ideals were crushed as a result, and the spirit felt
cramped and restrained. We may here see that Saturn, the ruler of the 4th
house, indicating the mother, is restraining Neptune, the
ruler of the 6th house, which indicates the service to be
rendered. Mercury in the 10th, the house of the 364 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS profession, is squaring Saturn and Neptune. We have
here the proof that the mother was not in sympathy with
this woman's choice of a profession, and forced her to
express herself through channels where the spirit felt
cramped and the artistic instincts were held in check. In
the case of a weak and negative personality this
sometimes works to advantage and the person does not
feel the restraint. But with a fixed and positive nature
such as we have in this horoscope, with five planets in
fixed signs and cardinal signs on the four angles, the case
is different. When a woman of this type has her ideals
shattered, she finds it most difficult to adjust herself to
the will of others. The impulses thus restrained most
frequently find an expression in some other direction.
In this case we find Neptune and Saturn trine
Uranus; the psychic side must then be the means of
giving this soul relief from its pent-up feelings. Uranus is
square Mars, and the Moon is conjunction and parallel
Mars. These afflictions together with those of Saturn,
Neptune, and Mercury gave this woman a negative
development. Mediumship was most attractive to her.
For a short time she had the greatest joy, for she
developed very rapidly, which we may see from Neptune
trine Uranus, indicating psychism. But had this poor soul
had a knowledge of astrology and could she have seen
the danger signals in the planets, she would not have
meddled with the negative phase of spiritual
development. She would not have forced her
development as we have found that she did. Being a SPIRIT CONTROL 365 positive character the Invisible Helpers were able with
her assistance to relieve her in a short time of a very bad
case of obsession, which she had developed through the
practice of mediumship.
The advice given to this woman through
Headquarters was to eat lightly of food consisting mainly
of vegetables and fruits, eliminating heavy proteins and
starches, and to keep her mind and body active, not
forgetting to pray, for prayer is a wonderful help and a
protection against adverse psychism.
We also find in this horoscope a very helpful lesson
relative to trouble with the throat. We find Neptune and
Saturn in conjunction in Taurus, which rules the throat
and larynx, square to Mercury in Leo; also Jupiter in
Taurus is square to the Sun in Leo, indicating that the
circulation of the throat would be impaired at some time.
Whenever we find Saturn and Neptune in conjunction
there is some difficulty in the development of the
corresponding organ. This woman developed a very bad
case of tonsillitis, and submitted herself to an operation
in which the tonsils were removed. This compilation © Phoenix E-Books UK CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
NO. 17A, 17B—THYROID GLAND TROUBLE W E will use a flat figure in both the following
cases as the hour of birth is not known. This
will not interfere with the diagnosis of disease, but
knowledge of the rising sign is necessary, however, in
determining the will of the patient. When the patient is
facing a crisis it is well to know the exact time of birth in
order to calculate the place of the Moon and its relation
to the transiting planets. These planets act as the minute
hand of the planetary clock. They determine by their
aspects to the radical and progressed planets whether the
disease has reached a critical point. Especially do the
new and full moons mark the time when changes may be
expected.
NO. 17A
Female, born April 25, 1877. W E are told in The Message of the Stars that
Neptune is the higher octave of Mercury, and
has rule over the pineal gland, while Mercury rules the 366 THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 367 thyroid. In this horoscope we find Venus, which rules the
venous circulation, in its own sign of Taurus, ruler of the
throat, in conjunction with Neptune and the Sun, also
square to Mars in the sign of Aquarius. Neptune, when
afflicted by Saturn, as in the second horoscope, 17B, causes atrophy or an undersized organ in whatever part
of the body he may be found by sign. If in Leo, he may
cause one valve of the heart to be smaller than the others, 368 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS producing irregularity of circulation. In this horoscope,
however, we find Neptune between Venus and the Sun,
which gives bulk, The Sun brings heat and a large supply
of blood to that part of the body in which it is placed by
sign. In this case the throat is the part receiving the
greatest flow of blood. When Mars is square to the Sun
or Venus we may find the corresponding organ enlarged
abnormally. Mercury, the planet which rules the thyroid
gland, is in Taurus, square to Uranus in the fixed sign of
Leo. Uranus in this sign also has a tendency to enlarge
the organ affected by it. Jupiter, which rules the arterial
circulation, is square to the Moon.
This woman suffered from an enlarged thyroid
gland, which reached such a size that it interfered with
the circulation and caused poor heart action. THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 369 NO. 17B
Male, born September 26 1863. V ENUS is in conjunction with the Sun, Mars,
and Saturn, these four planets being in the sign
of Libra and all in opposition to Neptune. This configuration, particularly the obstructing influence of
Saturn, caused a disturbance in the thyroid gland, which, 370 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS however, was not enlarged as in the previous case, but its
functions and circulation were interfered with. This
caused the man to suffer from weakened memory,
deranged kidneys, and enlargement of the prostate gland.
What could be advised in order to help these
patients? might be asked. In the case of the woman of the
first horoscope, where an excess of blood is found in the
throat and both Jupiter and Venus are afflicted, causing
poor arterial and venous circulation, we would advise a
brisk rubbing of the lower limbs with a pair of bath
gloves, also hot foot baths to cause the blood to circulate
more freely to the lower part of the body, thereby taking
the pressure away from the throat. We would also
decrease the amount of food which makes for flesh, such
as white bread, pastries, sugar, and the like. In the
second horoscope we find the Moon in Pisces, a watery
sign, which gives a craving for liquids. It is square to
Uranus. This, together with the conjunction of Venus
with Mars, Sun, and Saturn, indicates that the lower
nature, especially sex, has been the native's undoing. We
would advise elimination of highly seasoned foods,
liquor, tobacco, and meat, and that he live a simple life
with plenty of outdoor exercise. THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 371 NO. 17C—THE THYMUS GLAND
Male, born August 16, 1918, 1:45 A.M. T HIS is the horoscope of a young boy who has
the watery and cardinal sign of Cancer rising.
People with cardinal signs on the Ascendant are more
tense, or we may call it more high-strung and sensitive
than others. They feel more keenly. Not alone are their
feelings more quickly hurt, but their bodies are more
sensitive to pain, and their suffering is more intense.
This boy has the magnanimous and jovial Jupiter in
conjunction with the Ascendant. Jupiter is parallel to the
Moon, which is the ruler of the Ascendant, and Jupiter
and the Moon are in mutual exception. The suave and
loving Venus is in the first house, which will give the
native a beautiful form and face and a most lovable and
attractive personality.
At the age of about twenty months he was taken ill
with meningitis, which is an inflammation of the
membranes enveloping the brain and spinal cord. He
recovered from this illness, but his head began to
enlarge, and he lost his sense of hearing. The
enlargement of the head became so pronounced that it
necessitated operations. At two periods a little past the
age of three years (we judge the first to have been about
when the progressed Moon reached 27 degrees of
Capricorn, which brought it to the opposition of Venus,
or two months later when it reached the square of Mars)
two operations were performed. A small piece of bone 372 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS was removed from each temple, making an opening into
the brain. This caused water to gush out of the brain, and
seemed to relieve the child for a time; but later it was necessary to relieve the back of the head by two
operations just behind the ears, one on each side of the
head. We are unable to give the exact dates of these
operations. We believe, however, that the Moon's aspects
registered them. We find that about twenty-five months
after the first operation the Moon was in opposition to
Saturn, which registered another disturbance that we feel THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 373 probably marked the time of the operation on the back of
the head.
The parents brought this boy from the Midwest to
Los Angeles and placed him in charge of a noted
osteopathic physician, who superintended the operations
and treated him with the scientific manipulations of the
modern and excellent method of healing, osteopathy.
The parents also placed the child on our healing list with
the hope that he might regain his sense of hearing, which
he lost at about the age of one and one-half years. The
writer was not made familiar with the past of the boy
until after she had diagnosed the case to a friend, so we
will see how closely the planets tally with the case.
Venus, which has rule over the thymus gland, is
strong in the first house and is afflicted by the square of
Mars. Mars is close to the cusp of its own sign Scorpio.
Mars indicates injuries. Scorpio is the sign which has
rule over the physician. The birth of this boy was a very
labored one. The life of the mother as well as that of the
boy was despaired of. The present-day physician does
not allow the birth to be a natural one if it takes too much
of his time, for he is too busy and must hurry back to his
office to see his other patients. Consequently a large
proportion of births are hurried through the use of
instruments. In this case the forced birth caused an injury
to certain nerves and to the innominate blood vessels
which carry the blood through the thymus gland to the
brain. With Saturn in conjunction with the Sun in Leo,
which has rule over the spinal cord, and both in 374 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS opposition to Uranus, the spinal fluid was restricted and
sluggish. Uranus, which is the higher octave of Venus,
has rule over the pituitary body. This body is connected
directly with the outer sheath of the spinal cord, the dura
mater. Uranus being afflicted by the Sun and Saturn has
interfered much with the functions of the spinal fluids.
The thymus gland in a small child regulates the
blood flow to and from the brain through the innominate
artery and vein. At birth the neck of this child was in
some manner injured, causing restriction of the flow of
the blood. The circulation being restricted, the head
consequently filled with water. The most interesting
proof of this is that at the removal of the pieces of bone
from the temples, also from the back of the head, there
was no red blood in the wounds, at which the doctors
marveled. The osteopathic physician had been very
active in his manipulations and treatments of the thymus
gland and the spinal column, showing that his diagnosis
tallied with ours.
The boy is seemingly in good health but has lost his
hearing. There is some hope that this may be regained.
When he reaches puberty and the thyroid gland takes up
the work of the thymus gland, the nerves and the blood
vessels which serve the ear may be stimulated, and
through the aid of the Invisible Helpers the hearing may
be regained. There is, however, some danger that the
operations which were performed on the back of the
head may have permanently injured the nerves, which
would affect the hearing. THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 375 17D—THE ADRENALS
Female, born November 27th, 1905, 1:15 Plutão .M. T HIS young woman has the watery and negative
sign of Pisces on the Ascendant, and Jupiter, the
ruler, retrograde in Gemini in the third house in
opposition to the life-giving Sun. This to begin with is a
much hampered and restricted ruler, and is an indication
that this soul has in its former lives contracted debts of
destiny which have matured and await their payment in
this life; for if the life ruler is afflicted by the most
powerful planet, namely the Sun, also the square of
Saturn and the parallel of Mars, and is receiving little
help, having only one helpful aspect—the trine of Mars
from the twelfth house—then we may take it that this
person will have her debts to pay in this life, and there
will be no freedom until they are liquidated.
We find a very well-aspected Mercury in the 10th
house, in conjunction with the Moon, the Midheaven,
and Uranus, and sextile to Saturn. The Moon, which has
partial rule over the mind, is in conjunction with the
Midheaven, giving the native a quick, keen mind. From a
mental standpoint this girl should be able to accomplish
anything upon which she sets her mind, and one wonders
why such a mind is seemingly not accomplishing
anything. What is the cause?
We find common signs on all the four angles. The
life ruler, Jupiter, is retrograde in the common sign of 376 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Gemini, which is the sign of its fall, and the Sun also is
in a common sign. These are indications that this soul is
satisfied to drift with the tide. Whatever headway she
makes in this life will be through the prodding influence
of the father, signified by the tenth house. Jupiter has rule over the arterial circulation. His
afflictions tend to restrict the free flow of the
bloodstream. Jupiter also has rule over the adrenals, the THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 377 two tiny ductless glands which are over the kidneys.
These two organs, like the thyroid gland, help to take
care of the blood. As it passes through them, it receives
its supply of adrenal secretion. This secretion gives
energy to the body and causes the fluids to flow more
freely. The adrenals are the organs which stimulate the
body. When we find Jupiter, which has rule over these
organs, as the life ruler and so severely afflicted, we may
expect the patient to be lacking in energy, a negative and
ambitionless person.
Neptune, which is the higher octave of Mercury,
works upon the nervous system, and rules the pineal
gland and the spinal canal. It is retrograde and in
opposition to the spasmodic and erratic Uranus, the
planet which rules the pituitary body. Therefore we may
look for a general derangement of the ductless glands.
We find a disturbance of the adrenals, which are excited
by the emotions, causing an uneven flow of their
secretions, sometimes resulting in convulsions or the
opposite, coma, according to the character of the
uncontrolled emotions of the patient.
This girl is the daughter of a wealthy father and a
most self-willed and selfish mother, who is addicted to
the use of cigarettes and liquor. While the mother was
pregnant with this child, at times when she saw her
husband coming from his place of business she would
throw herself into a fit in order to work on his sympathy.
In this manner she would get all her selfish wants
supplied. We are told in the Rosicrucian teachings that 378 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the Ego is attracted to a parent through whom it may
receive its lessons, and it may well be said that this girl
found in her mother one who could bring to her many
sad lessons.
If the girl is crossed she quickly flies into a rage
which ends in a fit very similar to epilepsy. However,
she does not froth at the mouth, neither do her jaws set,
as is sometimes the case in the above disease. Temper
causes the adrenal fluid to flow too rapidly into the
blood. Excess of this fluid causes jealousy and envy.
We find two different conditions expressed in the
spells under which this girl labors. Jupiter is in
opposition to the Sun, and parallel to Mars, which causes
at times an excess of secretions, giving rise to the
condition already mentioned. At other times she will
swoon away, being perfectly lifeless and rigid. This last
condition is brought on when the adrenals stop sending
their fluid into the blood, indicated by Saturn square to
Jupiter. When under the first-mentioned condition she
has all the appearance of one who is obsessed and
becomes very cruel to those about her. This is also
shown in the horoscope by the opposition of Neptune to
Uranus.
The father has spent a fortune trying first one doctor
and then another, but to no avail. The girl is quite normal
when not laboring under the influence of these spells.
She, like her mother, also throws herself into them in
order to work upon the sympathy of her mother, sisters,
and father. THE DUCTLESS GLANDS 379 The latest diagnosis of the doctors is that a tumor is
growing in the brain near the cerebellum, and both the
girl and her mother wish her to have an operation, while
the father is bitterly opposed to it. What the outcome will
be remains to be seen. Should she submit to the knife, as
she is determined to do, she may spend the remainder of
her life in an institution as a mental patient. CHAPTER XXIX
SPECIAL CONDITIONS
NO. 18A—DEFICIENCY IN LYMPH
Male, born May 11, 1913, 6:59 A.M. A CHILD is the subject of this reading, who was
about fifteen months old at the time the reading
was originally made. Ordinarily it might seem
superfluous to judge the character and mentality of one
so young. Nevertheless, when we consider the body from
a spiritual standpoint as the temple of an indwelling
Divine Spirit, it will be seen that the builder and architect
of that temple must be taken into consideration from the
very first breath until the time when the silver cord
snaps.
The mercurial sign Gemini is rising, but there is not
the ordinary Gemini nature, for Saturn in Gemini puts
his obstructive hand upon this child and will give a
tendency to melancholy and a retiring disposition, a
desire to get away from society.
Mercury and Venus in Aries, square to the Moon and
Neptune, give a tendency to secretiveness, but the sextile
of Saturn to Mars and Saturn's trine to Uranus make the
mind idealistic and energetic. Thus on the whole there is 380 SPECIAL CONDITIONS 381 good material for the parents to work upon. They should
by all means discourage the tendency to secretiveness,
encourage idealism, and make the youngster play with his companions. It looks very much as though he might
be too much taken with himself, and from the very
earliest childhood he should be taught to go among
people. He should never be allowed to go out by himself
more than can possibly be helped. 382 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Usually children of this age sleep largely from
morning till night and from night till morning. As soon
as they have received food they go out into dreamland
that assimilation may be carried on better. But this is not
the case with our little subject; sleeplessness,
restlessness, and nervousness are the results of the
opposition of the Moon and Neptune to Jupiter and the
square of these three planets to Mercury and Venus
posited in Aries, the sign governing the head. Thus the
whole nature is aquiver, the child cannot get the needed
rest; hence, it is sick.
The main trouble comes from the fact that the Moon
is conjunct Neptune. This interferes with the distribution
of the fluid indispensable to assimilation, the lymph.
Jupiter is afflicted by these two planets, and he governs
assimilation. On account of these two facts the child will
not grow as fast as he might otherwise. He has peculiar
notions about his food, and these ideas will grow as he
grows. This tendency is one of the things that must be
dealt with firmly, for the square of the Moon to Venus
gives abnormal cravings. The Moon and Neptune in
Cancer will cause the child to long for something that he
never finds, and this might lead to the formation of
habits that would be extremely dangerous. No matter
how he may protest and though it may seem that
ordinary foods do not agree with him, he should be
taught to eat everything of a good and healthful nature
that comes on the table, for the formation of a healthy SPECIAL CONDITIONS 383 appetite will counteract the strange tendency that is
dormant in his nature. Sweets in moderation will help.
The circulation is interfered with by the affliction of
Neptune and the Moon to Venus and Jupiter. Saturn and
Uranus are strongly configurated by trine and parallel
from airy signs; this further reacts upon the circulation
and makes it spasmodic. The heart has a tendency to
flutter on account of the presence of Uranus in Aquarius.
Thus the poor little child is considerably afflicted to start
with. Nevertheless there is no need of worry, for the Sun
is trine to Jupiter and sextile to the Moon and Neptune.
The fact also that it is in the marvelously vital sign of
Taurus will operate to preserve life, and even Saturn on
the Ascendant gives persistence, resistance to disease,
and tenacity of life.
There will be crises in the life, however, which
knowledge of the foregoing will make it easier for the
parents to prepare for. The most severe one will come at
the time of puberty. Then the progressed Moon will be
working in the 8th house, the house of death, and in
opposition to its own place, configurated with Neptune
and square to Mercury and Venus. This is a serious
position but not all to be feared on account of the fact
that the Sun is so strong in the horoscope. Moreover the
trine of Saturn and Uranus and the sextile of Saturn and
Mars give a wonderful elasticity and energy to the nature
so that no matter though the boy be brought near the
grave, he will have the resilience to recuperate with
astonishing rapidity. 384 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS At the present time it should be investigated as to
whether the mother is nursing the child, and whether she
has felt nervous and run down. If so, the child should at
once be put upon a diet of goat's milk, which will give
the needed ether to compensate for the lack of lymph,
and though the child may not like the diet, he will grow
accustomed to it. NO. 18B—POLYPI AND KIDNEY TROUBLE
Male, born June 3, 1865, at 3:00 A.M. W E have here the horoscope of a man with the
fixed sign of Taurus on the Ascendant, and
the ruler, Venus, posited just above the Ascendant in
Taurus and in the 12th house. Venus is making but two
major aspects, a conjunction with the Ascendant, and a
square to the inflammatory Mars, which is in the fixed
sign of Leo and in the 4th house.
The sign of Taurus rules the neck, throat, lower jaw,
larynx, and tonsils, and its opposite sign, Scorpio, rules
the rectum, descending colon, urethra, and also the nose.
These signs of Scorpio and Taurus are the most vital
signs of the twelve. Mark the strange coincidence which
lies in the fact that Taurus rules the greater part of the
lower head and neck, and the organs adjacent to the
upper end of the spinal column, while Scorpio slips in SPECIAL CONDITIONS 385 with its influence by ruling the nose in addition to the
organs near the lower end of the spinal column. Leo, the
sign which squares Taurus and Scorpio, rules the river of
life, the spinal fluid, which connects the organs ruled by
Taurus and Scorpio. Now in the horoscope under consideration we find
the inflammatory Mars in Leo, square to Venus in
Taurus. Venus, being at home in this sign, naturally
attracts to herself the inflammatory influence of Mars 386 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS whenever Mars is found either in Taurus or afflicting her
in that sign. Then we may look for inflammatory
troubles in the nose, generative organs, or rectum. We
may also look for the polypus which is a small growth,
peduncular in shape, that grows from the mucous
membrane of the nose, and which often closes the nasal
passages, causing difficulty in breathing. It sometimes
also grows within the vagina or rectum. The habit of
mouth breathing in children often lays the foundation for
these growths in the nose when planetary afflictions are
present in the horoscope. The mucous membrane of the
nose is then abnormally sensitive and subject to
irritation, which may result in these polypi, frequently
causing hay fever or asthma.
The patient whose horoscope we are considering
suffered with these growths in both nasal passages,
making it necessary that he breathe entirely through the
mouth. The Moon is in Júpiter degrees and 19 minutes of
Libra in the 6th house, which is the house of health. The
Moon is the natural ruler of Cancer, the sign ruling the
stomach. At the age of twenty-eight, when the Moon by
progression had reached its place at birth, this man
became seriously ill with painter's colic, which later
resulted in permanent injury to the kidneys. The latter is
due to the Moon and Saturn in Libra, which sign has rule
over the kidneys. This general break in the health
increased the small growths in the nose, which resulted
in an operation when the Moon progressed into Scorpio
and was in opposition to Venus. SPECIAL CONDITIONS 387 By eliminating meat, tobacco, liquor, and all
condiments and living as near as possible to nature's
laws, this man is again enjoying good health. NO. 18C—PYORRHEA
Female, born July 13, 1871, 5:30 A.M. L EO, a fiery sign, here is on the Ascendant with
the life ruler, the Sun, in the 12th house in
Cancer in conjunction with Mercury and Uranus and
square to Neptune. We know from our reading of The
Message of the Stars that Cancer rules the stomach, in
which the greater amount of food must be digested. This
organ is the central supply station through which the
body receives its sustenance. Cancer also rules the
esophagus, the tube between the pharynx and the
stomach, and the thoracic duct, the principal duct which
carries the lymph of the body.
We note in this horoscope Uranus afflicted by a
square of Neptune from the Midheaven and the sign
Aries. With Mercury and the Sun also in conjunction
with Uranus and square to Neptune, we may expect an
abnormal or a radical mind. When an idea is formed it is
carried to an extreme. This woman could find no limit in 388 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS anything, and we find this tendency indicated regarding
food. With the sign of Cancer on the cusp of the 12th
house, the house of self-undoing and limitations, and
with the above afflictions of Uranus, Mercury, and the
Sun, we may expect great impulse and a decided
tendency to overeat. The planets in the 12th and 6th houses when
afflicted are the most detrimental to health, and in this SPECIAL CONDITIONS 389 horoscope we may look to the stomach as being the seat
of the trouble. Let us find the reason for this assertion:
The Moon which is the ruler of the 12th house is in the
house of friends, the 11th, and square to Venus in the
2nd in the 6th house sign, Virgo, ruling labor and
sickness. This plainly shows us that this woman was
most hospitable, loved to entertain her friends, was
happy when she could regale them, and, as indicated,
went to extremes in this direction. Venus square Moon
indicates an abnormal desire for pastry and sugar. It
indicates one who having eaten a heavy meal, richly
prepared, would indulge in chocolate creams and various
other ash-producing dainties. This is one of the types of
women whom we often meet, whose greatest pride is in
cooking and who are never so happy as when they are
entertaining at a sumptuously prepared table. Cancer
people are good cooks and usually take great pride in
catering to the needs of the stomach.
In this horoscope we find Saturn, the planet of
obstruction, in its own sign Capricorn and in the 6th
house of health. Saturn is in opposition to Jupiter in the
sign of the stomach and in the 12th house. Planets and
their afflictions often show their effect in opposite signs,
and when Saturn is in Capricorn we usually expect some
derangement of the stomach, for his effects there are
very similar to those of Saturn in Cancer. With Jupiter
ruling the arterial circulation, afflicted by Saturn, we
may expect trouble with the circulatory system of the
stomach. And with the spasmodic Uranus in conjunction 390 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS with Mercury, the nerves are also sensitive and nervous
indigestion is indicated.
Now, when Saturn afflicts the stomach, there is a
lack of pepsin and stomach fluids wherewith to digest
the food. Saturn in Cancer or Capricorn gives abnormal
appetite and makes one very fond of pastry, especially of
sugar, as does Venus square Moon mentioned before. As
vegetarians, such people find it very hard to keep their
bodies in good order for they will usually refuse raw
vegetables, preferring the starches and sugars. As a result
the body does not receive the proper amount of mineral
elements, and the blood soon fills with ash. When an
overabundance of refuse is stored up in the blood, the
body must seek a means of eliminating the waste matter.
If it is unable to find an outlet through which to throw
off the impurities, and if the bowels also refuse to do
their part, as is often the case when an overabundance of
food is consumed, then an illness is the result. We
frequently find cases of catarrh, skin disease, ulcers, etc.,
which are merely an avenue the body uses to dispose of
an excess of ash.
In the case of this woman we find the gums
eliminating pus and receding toward the roots of the
teeth. This disease is commonly called pyorrhea or
Riggs' disease and is increasing to an alarming degree in
America. It was rarely heard of fifty years ago, but since
there has developed such a craze for sugar and candy
humanity is paying the price. SPECIAL CONDITIONS 391 To overcome this disease a well-balanced, simple,
vegetarian diet, free from sugars and starches is
advisable, and the careful cleansing of the gums with
lemon water each day. NO. 18D—AUTO-INTOXICATION
Male, born November 4th 1882, 11:49 Plutão .M. T HIS horoscope is that of a man with the watery
sign of Cancer on the Ascendant. In diagnosing
it is customary to look to the sixth house, which has rule
over disease, and its ruler for the key to the trouble. In
this horoscope we have the sign of Capricorn on the cusp
of the sixth house, with its ruler, Saturn, in the 10th
house in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail, which is
Saturnian in its influence. Saturn is also conjunction
Neptune in Taurus. These are all in opposition to the
inflammatory Mars, which is strong in its home sign
Scorpio, having rule over the rectum and generative
organs. This is a most dangerous and subtle affliction,
increased by Neptune parallel the Sun in Scorpio, and
indicates an unrestrained passional nature which in
childhood found its outlet through the secret habit of
masturbation. This in time depletes the vitality, stunting 392 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS the mentality, and also the physical growth, and later in
life causes much physical trouble. Scorpio rules both the rectum and the vital organs,
and when excesses occur they often cause inflammation
in the rectum resulting in intestinal hemorrhoids,
interfering with elimination and causing a general
sluggishness of the excretory duct.
We find the spasmodic Uranus in Virgo, the sign
ruling the intestines; it is also the natural sixth house sign SPECIAL CONDITIONS 393 and the sign which rules sickness. Uranus is square to
Venus, which rules the venous blood. Here we have
indication of restricted circulation in the small intestine.
Jupiter, the planet of opulence, the planet which wants
things in large quantities, is in Cancer, the sign ruling the
stomach, and in the twelfth house, the house of selfundoing, sextile to the ruler of the Ascendant, the Moon,
indicating that this young man has been a very hearty
eater, carrying eating to excess.
He dissipated the life forces during the period of life
when he was in greatest need of them, and has also
consumed more food than the organs could digest and
distribute. Naturally, when the organs of elimination
refused to work, as might be expected, the blood stream
became charged with ash, causing granulation of the
joints through the excessive clogging generated in the
body from too much protein. This also burned up the
natural body oils, causing a granulation of the eyelids,
rheumatism, and a generally weakened condition of the
entire system.
Our advice to this patient would be to eliminate
meats and starches, taking very little of the proteins, and
to eat mostly fruits and vegetables; also to live a chaste,
clean life. Care should be taken to have his surroundings
clean and to sleep in a room with plenty of fresh air, for
when we find Saturn afflicted by the Dragon's Tail and
Neptune in Taurus, it indicates a tendency to neglect the
sanitation of the body and surroundings. 394 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 18E—PERITONITIS
Male, born August Júpiter , 1862, 11:30 Plutão .M. T AURUS, a fixed and stubborn sign, is on the
Ascendant, with the ruler, Venus, in the watery
sign of Cancer, square to the fiery and impulsive Mars,
and parallel to the ruler of Cancer, and watery Moon.
Venus is also ruler of the house of sickness, the 6th
house. Mars is in the 12th house in its own sign of Aries.
We may look for the key to the trouble in the
configuration and the positions of the above three
planets—Venus, Mars, and the Moon.
The planets that are in a location corresponding to
that part of the body in which the disease is found are not
alone the cause of the disease. If a burglar has entered
our home and carried away our jewels, the first step to be
taken to find the culprit is to ascertain the place of his
entrance. So also must we find the gateway or the cause
of the disease.
Venus, we know, is the planet ruling sweets, sugars,
etc. Taurus is the sign ruling the throat, the palate;
therefore Taurus has great influence over the appetites.
Venus is in Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach and the
thoracic duct, and is afflicted by a square to Mars. Mars
when afflicted by Venus and when in its own sign of
Aries causes dissipation and desire for excesses in
eating, especially when Venus is in the sign of the
stomach. Taureans are usually very fond of good things SPECIAL CONDITIONS 395 to eat and drink; they are hearty eaters and are apt to
gourmandize. Therefore with the above afflictions this
native would eat and drink to excess. Uranus in Gemini is in a very nervous position. This
excitable, restless, and nervous planet, especially as it is
squared by Saturn and Jupiter from another mercurial
sign, Virgo, will have a strong effect upon the nervous
system. 396 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Now, with Venus, which has rule over the venous
blood, afflicted by Mars, and with Jupiter, ruling the
arterial blood, afflicted by the conjunction of Saturn and
the square of Uranus, this man has a very sluggish
circulation, especially of the stomach and small
intestines. With both Jupiter and Saturn posited in Virgo,
what could be expected but that when an affliction
touches any of these planets sickness would result?
At the age of thirty-nine the native's progressed Sun
reached the square to Uranus which brought on nervous
trouble. At the same time the Sun was within one degree
of a conjunction of Saturn radical. The Sun takes three
years to pass a conjunction; one year applying, one year
in conjunction, and another year separating. Therefore,
this man passed through a double affliction at that time,
and a severe spell of peritonitis was the result. He was
unable to recover readily from this sickness, since
through his ignorance of the causes he did not stop his
heavy indulgence in food and drink. In 1918, when the
progressed Moon came to the square of Saturn and
Jupiter and the opposition of Uranus, another illness
occurred, which left him with a severe case of catarrh of
the intestines.
If a patient of this type should call upon a
probationer for advice and help, what should he advise?
He should first find the cause, and it is so evident there
that excess of food and drink were responsible that he
should advise abstinence from food for a short time,
especially that ruled by Mars, such as highly seasoned SPECIAL CONDITIONS 397 articles and condiments. Liquor and tobacco should be
entirely avoided. A strict vegetarian diet should be
advised with plenty of fresh air and sunshine to assist in
relaxing the nerves. Where the Venus and Jupiter
circulations are sluggish, a friction bath would be
advisable. 398 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 18F—ARTERIOSCLEROSIS
Male, born July 27th, 1856, 5:00 A.M. A S has been often stated in our astrological
books and lessons, man is master of his fate. He
has his whole life before him, either to make or to mar.
Here we have a horoscope for diagnosis that speaks for
itself—that of a man who has had everything in his
favor, with but two evil aspects in the entire horoscope;
everything else is good. We find the Sun and Venus
conjunction in the sign of the heart, Leo, one of the
strongest signs of the entire twelve. Both these planets
are sextile to the Moon and trine to Jupiter, Jupiter being
near the Midheaven. The mentality is decidedly strong
and keen, especially along metaphysical lines. Neptune
is in its own home (Pisces), sextile to Uranus and trine to
Mercury. The Moon is also well aspected and in a mental
sign, Gemini. This man has a wonderful start in life, and
brought over with him from a previous life many fine
qualities.
As is often stated in astrological books by old and
reliable writers, Jupiter in the Midheaven brings much
good to the native. And surely this man had many
opportunities to succeed. Now why did he fail?
First, we find Saturn in Cancer. As stated in The
Message of the Stars, page 257, this “indicates that the
stomach is weak and the gums subject to pyorrhea. There
is inability to properly digest the food.” The stomach is SPECIAL CONDITIONS 399 lacking in the fluids necessary to aid digestion. The
native is also very peculiar in his likes and dislikes as to
food. This is the key to his bodily afflictions. We find
Saturn making a square to Jupiter, which rules the
arterial blood, and as stated on page 299 of The Message of the Stars, under this aspect the native is “indolent and
inclined to drift with the tide; often a ward of society
either in the poorhouse or prison. This aspect also gives a
tendency to arteriosclerosis.” 400 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS We find the coarse, combative, discordant,
passionate, and hot-tempered Mars in Libra, a Venus
sign. When afflicted it brings out its own lower nature
and that of Venus, creating undue attraction to the
opposite sex. As Mars is co-ruler of the 5th house and is
making a square to the impulsive and egotistical
Mercury, the native's inharmony and hot temper have led
him to excesses. Instead of expressing the beautiful,
artistic, and musical nature of the Sun and Venus
conjunct on the Ascendant in Leo trine to Jupiter, this
man has directed an excess of love and vitality in the
wrong direction. He has indulged too freely in rich food,
and has expended much of his energy through the 5th
house of pleasures. He has had much inharmony in the
home, caused by himself and his temper. As a result the
blood has become vitiated, and he now is in a very
advanced stage of arteriosclerosis.
In order to find out the time of the affliction we will
go to his forty-fourth year, when the progressed Moon
had reached the 6th house in the first degrees of
Capricorn. It there made an opposition to Saturn in the
12th house in Cancer, the stomach, and a square to
Jupiter in the Midheaven. At the same time we find
progressed Mars has reached 24°51’ of Scorpio, making
an opposition to Uranus in Taurus. Impulse and excesses
in fast living at that time broke down his system, and
since then the man has been an invalid, perfectly
helpless, wheeled in a chair and confined in hospitals,
due to Saturn and Mercury in the 12th house of self- SPECIAL CONDITIONS 401 undoing. But he has always found some kind-hearted
woman friend to look after his wants. He has been a very
difficult patient; his temper has been dreadful. Through
his suffering he has allowed himself to drift into this
state of irascibility. Instead of responding to the beautiful
Venus influence he has given way to Mars square
Mercury.
In order to improve he should have a nurse with
Saturn well-aspected, one of an Aquarian nature, cool,
calm, and collected, who could soothe him, quiet his
temper, and with great diplomacy lead him into right
living. At present he demands certain food and unless the
nurse gives it to him he has a dreadful spell of temper.
This man would have to be loved into doing things. To
make a demand upon him or to tell him he dare not do a
certain thing would only awaken the spirit of opposition
in him. Brisk massage with a pair of rough bath gloves to
open the pores of the skin and start the circulation would
be beneficial. Proper food and assistance to control his
temper would in time help him to overcome his
condition. 402 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 18G—TYPHOID AND SPINAL TROUBLE
Male, born December 29, 2900, 12:45 A.M. F OUR cardinal signs are on the angles, with Mars
trine to the Sun and Saturn. These testimonies
show the person to be endowed with good vitality and
with an active and ambitious nature. But the
counteracting aspects are also strong. The Moon is
square to the Sun and Saturn, Mars is square to the ruler,
Venus, and the majority of the planets are under the
earth. This takes away from the general resistance of the
person. The opposition of Neptune to Jupiter and
Mercury in mental signs, Gemini and Sagittarius, shows
that the native is of a very nervous temperament.
Neptune in the 9th house usually gives a tendency to
be a dreamer of dreams, a visionary who grasps at the
illusory things in life rather than those that are near by
and tangible. Neptune's opposition to Mercury, the planet
of reason, shows that this would be particularly
accentuated in the present case. The Moon in Aries
square to the Sun and Saturn would further make the
mind flighty and unstable.
Mars in Virgo configurated with Uranus, whether by
good or evil aspects, makes a person liable to intestinal
disorders. Mars is the planet of inflammation and fevers.
He causes operations and other violence. Configurations
of Mars with Uranus have been observed to result not
only in typhoid and gastric fevers, but also very often SPECIAL CONDITIONS 403 Mars ruptures the peritoneum and causes the person to
have a prominent abdomen. The young man whose
horoscope we are considering had typhoid fever as an
initial disease when the Moon passed the conjunction of Mars by progression through the eleventh house. Later
she came to the square of Neptune, Jupiter, and Mercury.
Then the native's spine began to weaken. You will notice
that the opposition of Neptune to Jupiter and Mercury is
from Gemini to Sagittarius, covering the region of the 404 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS spine. The Moon later progressed to the opposition of
her own place at birth, and as the radical Moon in Aries
has particular dominion over the cerebellum, which is
the organ of coordination of movement, you will readily
understand that this makes it difficult for the patient to
walk.
This is a curious case of interlocking afflictions and
good aspects, for you will observe that whenever the two
principal afflicters—Mars and the Moon—are struck by
an adverse aspect, there is always a good set of aspects
to minimize the evil effects. Were this not so the severe
afflictions would certainly have done away with this
young man long ago. The square between the Moon and
Saturn is particularly inimical.
The Moon progresses around the horoscope in
twenty-eight years, as we measure a day for a year.
Saturn in the heavens by transit actually moves around
the circle of the zodiac in about thirty years. Thus the
progressed Moon and the transiting Saturn are always
bound to follow each other pretty closely. When they are
square at the birth of a person, they keep that same
relationship for a considerable number of years. Thus
good aspects in the horoscope are offset by the fact that
the progressed Moon is square to the transiting Saturn,
and evil aspects are similarly accentuated by this
unfortunate square. Therefore anybody who has this
unfortunate configuration is certainly under the whiplash
of Saturn all his life. Even the good aspects which we
note in this horoscope and which are certainly very SPECIAL CONDITIONS 405 strong are to some degree nullified by the square of
Saturn and the Moon at birth.
Saturn always indicates that part of our destiny
which has been brought over from previous lives, and is
almost unalterable. Therefore in this case there is
unfortunately not much to do. Baths and massage applied
by a healer who has Aquarius rising and whose Saturn is
not in Libra or Pisces would be most helpful. 406 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 18H—NARCOTICS, CIGARETTES
Female, born April 7, 1880, at 7:00 A.M. W E have here a most interesting case, that of a
woman with the fixed sign of Taurus on the
Ascendant, and with the ruler in the watery sign of
Pisces, intercepted in the 11th house, in conjunction with
the watery Moon, and square to the fiery and destructive
Mars. Mars is the ruler of the 12th house, the house of
confinement, and Venus is the ruler of the 6th house
governing sickness.
About 1904 the patient was operated on and had one
kidney removed. She could not give the exact year, but
from planetary aspects we feel certain it was in 1904,
when the progressed Sun had just passed a conjunction
with the radical Neptune near the Ascendant, and the
progressed Moon was making a square both to the
radical Neptune and the progressed Sun. At the present
writing this poor woman, who is forty-four years of age,
expects to become a mother in three months, and is
struggling to overcome the dread narcotic habit, which
she has had about six years, also the cigarette habit.
A most interesting principle is brought out in this
horoscope. Neptune in Taurus near the Ascendant is trine
to Uranus in Virgo in the 5th house. These planets are in
signs of mutual reception; that is, Neptune being the
higher octave of Mercury is in a Venus sign, Taurus, and
Uranus, the higher octave of Venus, is in the mercurial SPECIAL CONDITIONS 407 sign of Virgo. The trine of these two mystical planets
would indicate the development of the two ductless
glands represented by them, namely the pineal gland by
Neptune and the pituitary body by Uranus. When these two glands are for any reason awakened and the soul
does not respond to the higher life but is inclined to drift
into sensual and worldly channels, their awakening then
frequently leads to the grossest indulgence of the lower 408 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS nature—sometimes to drink or narcotics, as in the case
of this poor woman.
Venus and the Moon in conjunction in Pisces, Venus
being the ruler of the 6th house, governing sickness, and
Mars the ruler of the 12th house, governing hospitals,
indicate that some one in a hospital was responsible for
her forming the habit of taking narcotics from which she
is suffering and this person we believe to be a doctor
friend who attended her. At the time when she claimed
she acquired the habit of using narcotics we find the
progressed Mercury trine to Uranus and the progressed
Venus in conjunction with Neptune. This would have a
tendency to awaken the above-mentioned glands and
cause a soul hunger, which in this case the woman
mistook for a desire to indulge in soul flights through the
use of narcotics instead of through living the Christ life.
But the struggle now comes to get relief when she is
in a most weakened, despondent, and generally rundown
condition from a spell of influenza complicated by
pregnancy, nerves, and insomnia. Also the elimination
through the one remaining kidney is now being
interfered with by Saturn conjunction Sun in Aries,
which is producing an effect in the opposite sign of
Libra.
The one gleam of hope held out through the planets
is the progressed Sun within orb of a sextile to the
radical Jupiter and the progressed Mars trine to the
radical Moon. These aspects are most favorable for the
aid of the Invisible Helpers, who can accomplish much SPECIAL CONDITIONS 409 more under favorable planetary aspects than at other
times. Especially is she likely to receive help because her
spirit is most desirous of overcoming, although she is
lacking in faith regarding our method of healing. She
was persuaded to call upon us for help by her own
doctor, who had been healed through our Invisible
Helpers. CHAPTER XXX
INSANITY
NO. 19A—A MENTAL CASE
Female, born June 12, 1897, Mercúrio :00 Plutão .M. W E have at all times tried to impress upon the
minds of students of the Rosicrucian
Philosophy the great necessity of always looking at the
bright side of life, and ever to hold out hope to unhappy
and afflicted ones. If we aspire to be helpers of
humanity, workers in God's great vineyard, we must
always throw the lifeline to the drowning man; that is,
give him that hope, that help, which means life to him.
The astrologer who voices the doom of his patient and
takes the last ray of hope away when one who is
suffering comes to him, perhaps as the last resort, is little
less than a murderer. This may be putting it very
strongly, but the writer feels that this point cannot be
emphasized too much.
To illustrate the danger that lies in the prediction of
death: a woman wrote to Headquarters stating that she
had but two more years to live, for the astrologers had
predicted this. Would we advise her, she asked, to take 410 INSANITY 411 up the Rosicrucian Philosophy and astrology, and should
she go ahead with the school which she had started, or
would it be best to give everything up and prepare
herself or the coming event, her passing out of the physical body? We can assure you that this woman
received a letter from Headquarters that was surrounded
by strong vibrations, which scattered effectually the
thoughts of death. As a result of the letter she became a 412 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS student of the Philosophy and is today an active and
healthy woman, destined to reach a ripe old age. The
astrologer who predicted this woman's death might have
been guilty of murder, but fortunately, through her
coming in contact with one of our pupils who advised
her to write to Headquarters, this was averted.
In 19A we have a patient who has so many weak and
afflicted planets that the astrologer must use the greatest
diplomacy in order to encourage her. On the first house
cusp is the gloomy, pessimistic Capricorn, with the ruler,
Saturn, in the Midheaven afflicted by the conjunction of
the negative, visionary, worrisome Moon and the
irresponsible and fanatical Uranus. And to make it even
more unfortunate, these three planets are in conjunction
in the fixed and martial sign of Scorpio, the natural
eighth house sign, the house of death. Mercury, the ruler
of the mind, is in the gloomy and stubborn sign of
Taurus in opposition to the afflicted planets in Scorpio.
Could we find anything more unfortunate for mental
trouble? When Taurus is afflicted he assists Capricorn in
magnifying the gloom side of life and increases his
brooding over imaginary ills, so you can imagine the
temperament of this poor woman. She was sadly in need
of help.
Her request for help came to us in November, 1916.
She was at that time in such a mental state that she had
threatened suicide, could do nothing but weep, and was
surrounded by imaginary troubles. But she was very INSANITY 413 faithful in writing her weekly letters and did all possible
to cooperate with the healers. When she requested
healing her progressed Mars was square to the radical
Moon, Uranus, and Saturn in Scorpio, which caused this
mental disturbance. But fortunately the progressed Moon
at that time was in 25 degrees of Cancer, trine and sextile
to the afflicted planets in the 10th and 5th houses
respectively. This was the lifeline that was ready to be
thrown to help her.
Note that the artistic, harmonious, and musical
radical Venus is in her own sign of Taurus, trine to the
reverent and optimistic Jupiter. The one window of light
open to her was this good aspect—music and art. It was
necessary to bring harmony into this poor inharmonious
mind, and we prevailed upon her and her friends to
provide her with music in the home and to interest her in
art. At the time of her request for help her progressed
Sun was in Mercúrio degrees and 50 minutes of Cancer, making
a good aspect to the radical Venus. This was the means
of saving her reason. In May 1917 she wrote us she was
feeling so much better that she did not need the help of
the healers any longer.
Here we can see what a wonderful work can be done
through a true knowledge of astrology. Had an
unscrupulous astrologer met this woman and predicted
suicide, the danger of which as shown so plainly in the
figure, he might have been her murderer. Therefore, dear
friends, we hope you will take this as a lesson to use
astrology to help and to heal and not to wound. 414 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 19B—INSANITY
Female, Born January 7, 1868. A LTHOUGH we are unable to predict the dates
of crises in her illness on account of the lack of
the birth hour, still the aspects between the planets in this
woman's chart, show sufficiently well the nature of the
illness and the yearly crises. We find the erratic and
eccentric Uranus in the psychic sign of Cancer, in
opposition to Mars, the planet of impulse and
recklessness. Uranus is also in opposition to the lifegiving Sun and to Mercury, the planet of reason, both
placed in the belligerent and violent sign Capricorn. All
four of these planets are square by Neptune in Aries, the
sign which rules the head and the brain.
We find that the benevolent ray of Jupiter is
quenched by its placement in the twelfth house sign of
Pisces, indicating sorrow, trouble, and self-undoing.
There it is conjoined with the saturnine Dragon's Tail
and squared by the Moon, the giver of visions and
imagination, making the mind morbid. He is also
squared by Saturn, the planet of gloom and melancholy.
As a result of all these adverse, perverse, and perverting
influences the poor woman has always been weakminded, impulsive, reckless, gloomy, erratic, and
visionary. In the year 1915 matters came to a crisis when
the Sun was in the twelfth house sign of Pisces, ruling
hospitals and asylums. The progressed Moon also was INSANITY 415 there in conjunction with the Sun and the saturnine
Dragon's Tail, and all of them square Saturn, with the
result that the woman was taken violently insane and had
to be confined in an asylum, where she has been ever
since. There has been little or no improvement so far as
the mental condition is concerned, and the condition of
physical health is also delicate. It is not a hopeless case, however, for the principal
inimical influences are from cardinal signs, whose force 416 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS is comparatively soon spent, and the remainder are from
common or flexible signs which are subject to
modification. Note that Neptune, the planet of the
spiritual mind, is sextile to Venus, the planet of music,
and to the Moon, the planet of impressionability. Venus
and the Moon are trine. This shows that the native loves
music and that she may be helped by it. With respect to
health we find the Moon in Gemini, the sign that rules
the lungs, which gives a tendency to colds in the lungs.
Uranus is in Cancer, squared by Neptune and in
opposition to the Sun, Mars, and Mercury, which shows
nervous indigestion, for Cancer rules the stomach. This
can be minimized by proper food, and if this can be
provided it will help considerably to clear the mind.
In dealing with the question of insanity students
should remember that it is a rupture, complete or partial,
in the chain of bodies linking the spirit to the physical
vehicle. When the rupture occurs between the dense
body and the vital body, or between the latter and the
desire body, we have the harmless idiot. When the break
is between the desire body and the mind, the reckless,
impulsive, and violent desire nature takes charge of the
lower vehicle, and we have the violently-raving maniac
who must be restrained by a straightjacket and padded
cell. But when the rupture takes place between the mind
and the spirit, the cunning and craftiness of the mind
exert themselves to take charge of the lower personality.
An insane person of this order may go about among us
for years plotting and scheming with such consummate INSANITY 417 cunning that we never suspect him of being abnormal
until he carries out some diabolical plot and then laughs
and gloats over the ruin, sorrow, and suffering which he
has brought upon his victims.
NO. 19C—INSANITY, OBSESSION, AND
TUBERCULOSIS
Male, born January 30th, 1889, at 12 noon. T HIS horoscope was sent us by the relatives of
the native, with permission to use it as a lesson.
We find some very interesting points in it, which may be
of interest in the study of the science of diagnosis.
Two special points must be taken into consideration
in the horoscope of a patient: the sign on the Ascendant
and Mercury. The Ascendant shows the strength of the
personality. If fixed signs are on the four angles—
namely, the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth cusps—then
the patient will be apt to help the healer with his will to
overcome disease. If, however, common signs are on the
angles, then the patient is apt to drift with the tide, and is
prone to lean upon the Invisible Helpers, expecting them
to do all the work, failing usually to do anything for
himself. To get the best cooperation from the patient it is
most necessary that the mind be willing to help. Where
there is a weak or a stubborn mind, the patient can do 418 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS much to thwart the efforts made in his behalf, as we find
in this horoscope. Mercury being in a fixed sign in the tenth house and
square to Neptune here gives a most dominating and
stubborn mentality. This is a person who will bear no
interference or domination from others.
He has naturally a very devout and religious nature,
but instead of following the soul's ideals, which are
expressed by Jupiter in Sagittarius sextile to Mercury in INSANITY 419 Aquarius, his stubborn and ambitious mind led him to
respond to the vibrations of Venus square Jupiter,
Mercury square Neptune, and Moon square Uranus.
Venus is exalted in Pisces, the sign of self-undoing,
and in the eleventh house, square to Jupiter, which is
strong in its own sign of Sagittarius, the sign of religion.
This indicates that a woman friend with her flattery and
attention, signified by Venus, was responsible for
leading him from his religious ideals into negative
metaphysical speculation. In addition, the versatile and
restless Moon makes a trine to Neptune in the occult
twelfth house, which gave him the desire for occult
knowledge, but the Moon, being square to Uranus, led
him to his undoing. A person with the planetary
positions and aspects which we find in this horoscope is
not satisfied to follow instruction or heed the warnings of
those who know about occult matters, but he must needs
rush in and investigate for himself. The Sun in the
saturnian sign of Aquarius in opposition to Saturn in the
sign of Leo gives a vein of skepticism, a nature which
demands evidence and which must prove all things. This
spirit was his undoing. The Sun and Saturn being in
mutual reception in the tenth and fourth houses
respectively, strengthened this tendency.
With the Moon trine Neptune and square Uranus this
man developed mediumship very quickly and was able
to contact the invisible realms. But he heedlessly sought
his knowledge along dangerous paths. While the yogi
teachings may be safe for the Fourth Race people, the 420 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS Orientals, and for those of the Western races who are
still on the lower rounds of evolution, yet to one of the
sensitive Western type these oriental teachings are most
dangerous. This poor man became attached to a group of
Hindus, from whom he received instructions in breathing
exercises and psychic development. He was also active
in spiritualism wherein mediumship was encouraged.
After a few years the progressed Moon reached the
opposition to the radical Saturn and later a conjunction
with the radical Mercury. Neptune, being the higher
octave of Mercury, works largely upon the nervous
system, and any undue stimulation will sometimes cause
mental unbalance if Neptune squares the mental planet
Mercury, often expressing itself through religious mania.
This poor man repeatedly claims that he is the
reincarnated Jesus. Especially will Neptune give this
tendency when in the twelfth house, where it often
causes incarceration in an institution for the insane. The
Moon in the ninth house in Capricorn, square to Uranus,
here increased the evil by attracting undesirable entities
to this already weakened mind, which was easily driven
out of the body, giving the obsessing entities freedom to
take possession of it.
To top off this most unfortunate condition the poor
man, who has been in an insane asylum for some years,
is slowly dying of that dread disease tuberculosis. This is
shown by Jupiter in Sagittarius (Jupiter ruling the arterial
blood) square to Venus (which has rule over the venous
blood) in Pisces, two common signs. CHAPTER XXXI
ASTHMA
NO. 20A—ASTHMA
Male, born August 15, 1915, 2:00 Plutão .M. W E find the fiery sign of Sagittarius on the
Ascendant, and its ruler, Jupiter, at home in
Pisces. This planet is at home in two signs, Sagittarius
and Pisces. When planets are posited in the 1st, 4th, 7th,
and 10th houses, their influence is much more potent,
much stronger for either good or evil than elsewhere, and
especially if they are in fixed signs or in their own
homes. Jupiter is in its own home and in the 4th house,
an angle, and rules the arterial blood. It is in square
aspect to the fiery Mars, which is in the sign of the lungs,
Gemini. Mercury, the ruler of Gemini, ruling the air
passing through the lungs, is in conjunction with the Sun,
and these two planets are in the fiery sign of Leo ruling
the heart. Now what would be the physical effect of the
two afflictions noted above?
It is necessary that a certain amount of air be taken
into the lungs in order to supply the oxygen which is
needed to give life to the blood which feeds the heart. 421 422 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS With the ruler of Gemini, Mercury, burned up by the
heat of the Sun and the capillaries of the lungs filled with
the fire of the feverish and afflicted Mars, we have a congested and feverish chest, and the blood is clogged
and becomes sluggish, causing spasmodic action as it
passes through the aorta. The lungs become feverish and
breathing laborious, causing spasms. We find Mars
parallel to Saturn, which is in the sign of the stomach,
Cancer, and in the 8th house, indicating poor ASTHMA 423 assimilation of the food. We find the planet Venus,
which rules the venous circulation, in the hot and fiery
sign of Leo in opposition to the spasmodic retrograde
Uranus, which is strong in its own sign Aquarius, giving
uneven action to the heart.
This boy will suffer more or less all through life with
what is commonly termed by the doctors “asthma”. The
first few years he suffered very much from spasms. He
will also be subject to coughs and colds, which will,
however, never develop into consumption, as is often the
case. With Mars ruling the lungs there is frequently a
congested, feverish condition in the capillaries, which
burns up the oxygen. But here Mars is in sextile to the
life-giving Sun in Leo, hence this boy will recuperate
very rapidly. He will be above the average in health in
spite of the many afflictions, and he will reach a ripe old
age. 424 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 20B—ASTHMA, MORPHINE ADDICTION
Male, born August 15, 1869, Mercúrio :00 A.M. W E will judge first the character of this person
and for this purpose we note that there are
four cardinal signs on the angles. This is a great help
toward making people mentally alert and well-balanced,
but unfortunately here we find that Mercury, the
significator of the mind, is combust, and the Moon is in
conjunction with Saturn. This renders the mind slow and
melancholy, subject to fears, which of course never
materialize. Uranus is elevated and square to Neptune,
which gives a tendency toward spirit control, but we
have the trine of the Sun to Neptune to minimize the
danger. The native has a strong love nature as shown by
the trine of Venus and Jupiter, but the conjunction of
Moon and Saturn shows that the marriage partner is
likely always to wet-blanket and resent advances. Mars
opposition Neptune from the first to the seventh house
makes it plain that there will be quarrels and trouble, all
of which have an important bearing upon the sickness
and its cause.
The Sun in Leo afflicted by Jupiter in Taurus shows
that the arterial circulation is poor, a condition which is
somewhat minimized by the trine of Jupiter and Venus,
the two planets which govern the circulation. But the
rhythmic motion of respiration is seriously interfered
with because Uranus is in Cancer and elevated. This ASTHMA 425 planet is spasmodic in its action and affects the
diaphragm when placed in Cancer. Here it is, as said,
highly elevated and square to Mars and Neptune, both in
angles, a configuration that is very strong. The rhythmic rise and fall of the diaphragm is absolutely essential to
proper and regular respiration, and as this action is
interfered with to a degree by the afflictions here shown,
we have the condition known as asthma. 426 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS It is well known that sufferers from this disease
sometimes go a very long time without sleep because of
their inability to lie down. Morphine is often given to
relieve their condition and give them the rest they crave
with all their being. The danger of this drug cannot be
overestimated in any case, but it is greater for a patient
who has Jupiter in Taurus afflicted by the Sun, like this
one, for this always gives an inherent abnormal appetite,
a tendency to go to extremes in whatever is taken by way
of the mouth. Hence it is no wonder that this person has
become addicted to the use of morphine.
There is hope, however, as shown by the horoscope.
The Moon rules the alimentary canal and is responsible
for the passage of the food through the digestive tract.
She is conjunct Saturn, and naturally this results in a
sluggish condition of the bowels. Uranus in Cancer
operates upon the stomach in such a way as to distend it
periodically. With a full colon, a distended stomach, and
the diaphragm moving erratically, what wonder that the
heart refuses to force the vital fluid into the lungs and
take it from them. Heroic methods should be taken to
clear the system and keep it clear. While this will not
relieve the spasmodic action of the diaphragm, it will at
any rate take the pressure away from the apex of the
heart and thus materially help to reduce the condition.
Mars is sextile to the Sun, therefore the heart can be
strengthened. He is also sextile to Saturn, showing the
possibility of securing at least better action and
circulation in the digestive tract. ASTHMA 427 The worst condition in this horoscope, the one most
difficult to overcome, is Jupiter in Taurus square to the
Sun. It has been our experience that even though it is
pointed out to people that they have abnormal appetites
and they acknowledge it, they usually refuse to mend
their ways. As the above affliction is in fixed signs, it is
exceedingly difficult to overcome. The best assistance,
however, would be from the trine of Venus to Jupiter,
which excites the love nature and makes the native
amenable to kindness. The tender care of a woman
would perhaps do more than anything else to help him
overcome the habit he has formed. A healer with
Aquarius rising and whose Saturn is not in Pisces would
very likely have a beneficial effect in this case. 428 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 20C, 20D, 20E—ASTHMA T HE disease designated by the name of asthma is
one of the most difficult to diagnose, for many
are suffering from symptoms which are diagnosed by the
doctors as those of asthma because of the shortness of
breath, wheezing, and coughing, when frequently the
person does not in reality have asthma. There are various
kinds of this disease. For instance there is hay asthma,
which comes in the fall of the year when the hay and
grain are ripe. Sometimes it comes from the noxious
pollen of poisonous flowers, which causes a contraction
of the passages to the lungs; these, when inactive, fill
with mucus, causing labored breathing. Then we have
the heart or stomach asthma, which is often the result of
irregularity of the blood flow through the valves of the
heart, resulting in labored breathing and contraction of
the chest and lungs. Therefore the astrologer may find
the diagnosis difficult.
We will in this lesson endeavor to give a few helps
showing according to the afflictions the differences in
diseases which may have similar outward symptoms but
the causes of which may be different.
Case 20C is that of a man born March 6, 1831, Júpiter Plutão .M. The horoscope for this case is 10A, page 263. We
find the disturbing Saturn in Leo, the sign ruling the
heart, square to Mars in Taurus, which has rule over the
throat, and opposition to Mercury, which is in the
nervous sign of Aquarius. Mars is also square to ASTHMA 429 Mercury and parallel to Neptune. This configuration of
planets in fixed signs would indicate spasmodic heart
action, for Mercury opposition Saturn would cause
contraction of the valves of the heart, thereby interfering
with the excessive blood flow caused by Mars square
Saturn. We also find the Sun in Pisces, a common sign,
square to the Moon in Sagittarius. Common signs when
afflicted interfere with the organs of respiration, giving a
tendency to trouble with the lungs. This man suffered
greatly with what some doctors diagnosed as asthma and
others as heart trouble, and he also frequently suffered
from severe colds. Astrology shows that he had valvular
heart trouble and that is was not a true case of asthma.
He died from an abscess of the liver. For details
regarding this condition see No. 10A.
In the case of horoscope 20D, that of a man born
August 25, 1867, we find Saturn in Scorpio, a fixed sign,
square to Venus and Mercury in Leo, the sign ruling the
heart. We again find some trouble with poor heart action;
but the most disturbing affliction is found in the
stomach, for the Moon and Uranus are in conjunction in
the sign of Cancer, which has rule over this organ, and
both are square to the inflammatory Mars, Uranus also
being square to Neptune, all in cardinal signs. In this
horoscope we find the seat of the trouble in the stomach,
showing impulsive and unnatural habits regarding food,
with a tendency to bolt the food and also excessive
drinking with meals, which would cause the stomach to 430 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS become distended, thereby pressing upon the heart and
interfering with respiration. In horoscope 20E, that of a woman born June 23,
1898, we find a very different cause, and we may
diagnose this as a real case of hay asthma. Neptune is
conjunction Mercury in the sign of Gemini, which has
rule over the lungs. From the indications of personal
appearance we should think that this young woman had
Virgo rising with Gemini in Midheaven, giving Mercury ASTHMA 431 as the life ruler. Neptune, being the higher octave of
Mercury, has rule over the nervous system. Neptune's
influence is similar to that of Saturn—constricting,
astringent. When in Gemini, we may expect a
disturbance in the bronchioles, especially during the
summer months, as was the case with this young woman,
whose trouble was caused by the inhalation of the pollen
of certain grasses and flowers. You will, however, find that in most cases of asthma
there is impaired circulation. The blood stream is 432 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS sluggish, showing an affliction to Venus or Jupiter.
When the blood is impure, elimination will also be
sluggish.
Great care should be used in the selection of food.
The patient should eat very lightly and only such foods
as are easily digested but which give the proper
nourishment. Especially is this true of the evening meals,
for attacks of asthma invariably follow a heavy meal at
night. Raw onion sandwiches eaten the last thing at night
can cut the phlegm and insure a sound sleep. CHAPTER XXXII
CANCER
NO. 21A—CANCER
Female, born July 14, 1897, Júpiter :00 Plutão .M. S AGITTARIUS, a common sign, is on the
Ascendant, and the life ruler, Jupiter, is in the
9th house in the sign of Virgo; Jupiter is also square to
the Ascendant. People with common signs on the four
angles rarely make sufficient effort to surmount the
obstacles of life, and when we also find the afflicting
planets in these common signs, and the Sun in the watery
sign of Cancer and in the 8th house, we have, as in the
case of this woman, one who would rather be an invalid
than make the effort to keep the body in health, and we
can see how weak the effort will be to overcome.
First, people with the Sun and Moon in Cancer are
very fond of good things to eat, and when the Moon is
also trine to Venus this enhances their love for food and
there is a tendency to overeat. Let us see what will be the
result.
We find the planet Venus, which has rule over the
venous blood, in the sign of Gemini, and in the 7th 433 434 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS house, square to the inflammatory Mars and to Jupiter.
Jupiter, which has rule over the arterial blood, is afflicted by a conjunction of Mars, hence the circulation is very
much obstructed, especially as Jupiter is in the sign of
Virgo, which has rule over the small intestine. When the
patient eats very heartily (especially as Cancer people are
very fond of starches), with the obstructed circulation
and the disturbed assimilation of food in the small CHAPTER XXXII 435 intestine, what may we expect but that the bowels are
filled with putrid matter. Fermentation set in, causing
derangement of the entire circulatory system. Saturn, the
obstructor, in conjunction with Uranus in the sign of
Scorpio, which has rule over the rectum, and in the 12th
house, the house of self-undoing, also the house of
hidden things, is an indication that the young woman had
formed secret habits which caused much irritation to the
organs of elimination and which had their result in
causing cancer of the rectum.
She was ailing for a long time with dreadful pains
across the lower bowels and at the lower end of the
spinal column. The question may be asked, is there not a
cure for this dread disease of cancer? Yes, when in its
first stages, it may be cured by eliminating all food for a
few days, drinking only pure, distilled water flavored
with lemon juice, and giving the bowels a thorough
cleansing with high enemas. Then start with the monodiet, continuing this for three weeks if the patient is able
to stand it, but not to exceed three weeks. The patient
should eat nothing but carrots. This vegetable may be
prepared in various ways to make it palatable, grinding it
and drinking the juice, baking or steaming it or making it
into salads flavored with a little olive oil and lemon. The
carrot has a pronounced healing effect, especially when
used as a poultice, and it has a wonderful healing power
for ulcer and cancerous growths. 436 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS NO. 21B—CANCER
Male, born December 14, 1857. Place and hour of
birth unknown, but from personal appearance and traits
of character we have placed Sagittarius on the
Ascendant. Planets' positions for noon, G.M.T. T HE doctors had told this man that he had cancer,
and nothing could shake his belief that he would
some day pass out with the dread disease. He kept up his
letters to the Healing Department regularly for several
months, but they were always filled with doubt of our
methods and discouragement regarding the future. He
also rebelled at the restrictions in diet, claiming that he
was too weak and sick to live without his daily beefsteak
and fried potatoes.
Later, through the instrumentality of his son, who
was working in our office as stenographer, this man with
his wife rented a cottage on a tract which adjoined the
Headquarters grounds. In order to make it possible for
his father to partake of the health diet served in our
dining hall, the son applied for a job as gardener for his
father.
The first few weeks this poor man was a great trial to
the cook. When he failed to get what he demanded, he
left the table hungry. This lasted for a few days until
hunger forced him to eat what was served. His demands
were for two eggs fried in butter, a large bowl of soft,
boiled mush with several teaspoons of sugar and plenty CHAPTER XXXII 437 of cream, fried potatoes, white bread, and two or three
cups of strong, black coffee with several teaspoons of
sugar in each. The sugar bowl was emptied at each meal.
He greatly tried the patience of both Mr. Heindel and myself. But the young son, who had supported his father
for a number of years, was desperately anxious to help us
to help the latter. After a few weeks the patient adjusted
himself, and immediately his health began to improve.
The eruptions on his face and his breast began slowly to 438 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS disappear, and his general health and strength began to
return.
During the day it was observed that he was
constantly eating candy; his pockets were filled with this
sweet. Before coming to Headquarters he would eat one
to two pounds of candy every day, and thought it
necessary to do so to keep up his strength.
We note the conjunction of the Moon and Venus just
above the Ascendant in the negative sign of Sagittarius.
The Moon and Venus conjoined, no matter where they
may be in the horoscope, give a desire for sweets, pastry,
etc.
In this case we find Saturn posited in the sign of the
stomach, Cancer, and retrograde. This man had for years
filled his body with an excess of starch, protein, and
sugar. With his afflicted progressed Saturn in Cancer he
was not able to extract the vitamins from his food, and
he was in the habit of overeating and of bolting it.
Naturally the body stores up excess amount of food
taken. His stomach refused to digest such quantities of
food, or rather was too weak and lacking in the juices
necessary in digestion. There was also a large amount of
waste matter which the organs of elimination were
unable to throw off. Mars has rule over the rectum, being
the ruler of Scorpio which governs this organ. With Mars
afflicted by the obstructive progressed Saturn we might
expect that the man would suffer from constipation.
With all this ash stored up in the body can we
wonder that the system has to find some means of CHAPTER XXXII 439 throwing out this poison? The result was that the skin of
the nose, throat, face and breast (Mars ruling Aries the
face, Scorpio the bridge of the nose, and Saturn in
Cancer the breast) was used as a dumping ground for the
body waste. After eight months of Mt. Ecclesia diet this
man moved back to the city with not a trace of cancer on
his body; all sores had entirely healed. Mars sextile to
the life-giving Sun brought vitality. Wherever a good
aspect between these two planets is found, there is great
hope of overcoming disease.
Saturn in Cancer in the eighth house, the house of
death, will eventually be the cause of the native's demise,
together with the Moon and Venus in a common sign
and in the house of self-undoing. In time his desire for
sweets and rich food will probably lead to excesses
which will be the cause of his death. CHAPTER XXXIII
ROSICRUCIAN HEALING
HOW THE ROSICRUCIANS HEAL THE SICK T HE Rosicrucian work of healing is carried on by
the Elder Brothers of the Rosicrucian Order
through a band of Invisible Helpers whom they are
instructing.
The work is conducted according to the commands
of Christ Jesus, namely, “Preach the gospel and heal the
sick.”
THE ELDER BROTHERS These are high spiritual beings through whom the
Christ Spirit is working for the benefit of humanity.
THE INVISIBLE HELPERS The Invisible Helpers are those who live a worthy
life of helpfulness during the daytime while in their
physical bodies, and whose evolutionary development is
such as to earn the privilege of being helpful through the
instrumentality of the Elder Brothers at night while
functioning in their etheric bodies, as indicated in the
words of the Rosicrucian Evening Service: “Tonight 440 ROSICRUCIAN HEALING 441 while our physical bodies are peacefully resting in sleep,
may we as Invisible Helpers be found faithfully working
in the vineyard of Christ.” These Invisible Helpers are
gathered together in bands according to their
temperaments and their abilities. They are under the
instruction of other Helpers who are physicians, and all
of them work under the guidance of the Elder Brothers,
who naturally are the moving spirits of the whole work.
Not infrequently patients are aware of the presence
of the Invisible Helpers.
RIGHT LIVING NECESSARY FOR A CURE The Invisible Helpers never refuse to answer an
appeal for help, but in order to respond to the Divine
Healing Force patients must adopt the gospel of right
living: they should observe a pure meatless diet; they
must fill their living and sleeping rooms with pure air,
their minds with pure thoughts and their daily lives with
pure actions. The Divine Healing Force is pure; if you
ask for it in order to be relieved of your ailments, you
must be willing to conform to the natural laws of purity.
Pure air, pure food, pure thinking and pure living! If you
ignore these great health giving factors you may have
called in vain upon the Divine Healing Force. 442 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS HEALING FORCE The healing force comes from God, our Heavenly
Father, the Great Physician of the Universe. It is latent
everywhere. By prayer and concentration it is liberated
and directed to the sufferer. It manifested through the
Master, Christ Jesus. It goes forth from the weekly
healing meetings held at the Rosicrucian Fellowship
Headquarters. Through the workings of this supreme
force the Invisible Helpers raise the vibrations of the
patient to a higher rate, thus enabling him, first, to
eliminate the disease poison from the system, and
second, to rebuild every blood corpuscle, fiber, tissue,
and organ until the whole body is made new. This is
done, not in a miraculous manner but in accordance with
nature's laws. If the patient continues to break these laws
and by a wrong mode of living to accumulate poisonous
substances in the system, he frustrates the healing work.
CAUSE OF DISEASE The wonderful organism called the human body is
governed by immutable natural laws. All disease results
from willful or ignorant violation of nature's laws.
People are ill because in this earth life or in a previous
one they have disregarded the fundamental principles on
which the health of the body depends. If they wish to
regain and to retain their health, they must learn to
understand these principles and to regulate their daily
habits in conformity with them. ROSICRUCIAN HEALING 443 This is what the Master Healer, Christ Jesus, meant
when he said to the man who was a cripple: “Thou art
made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto
thee” (John 5:14). Even the Christ could not give lasting
health unless the recipient of the healing force refrained
from indulging wrong habits which cause disease, and
lived in obedience to the God-given laws that rule man's
body as well as his relations to his fellow creatures.
THE RIGHT TO HEALTH Some people “demand” perfect health and claim they
have a right to it. They forget that either in this or a
former life some have forfeited their God-given right
through disobedience to nature's laws, which are God's
laws. Through suffering they have to learn obedience.
When they have mastered their lesson and are willing to
“sin no more,” their right to health will be restored to
them.
VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF HEALTH The Divine Healing Force is constructive; wrong
methods of living which disregard the laws of nature are
destructive.
The omissions and transgressions responsible for
wrong living and consequently for disease are many. The
following are the principal ones: Unnatural food; too
much food; ill-proportioned food; lack of fresh air and
sunshine; lack of cleanliness; lack of exercise; lack of
rest and sleep; lack of self-control; sleeping in 444 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS unventilated rooms; harboring thoughts of anger, hatred,
and resentment; yielding to a hasty temper; gratifying
low desires; harming fellow creatures, whether human or
animal; abusing the sacred generative function.
Since all the organs and functions of the body are
interdependent, the abuse and consequent affliction of
one part hurts all the others, furthers the accumulation of
disease poison throughout the system, and lowers the
vitality of the whole. The local symptoms are only
evidence of the whole body being at fault. Therefore, all
true healing, in order to achieve lasting results, is
directed not to the suppression of symptoms but to the
removal of the cause that made the symptoms appear.
SPIRITUAL HEALING Spiritual healing operates on the higher planes of
being but is effected in strict adherence to natural laws,
which prevail below as above; consequently, all natural
therapeutics applied on the physical plan are in harmony
with the work of the Invisible Helpers on the higher
planes.
RIGHT FOOD IS NATURAL MEDICINE As the body is built up of the physical substances
introduced into the blood by the daily food, right food is
the natural medicine which the patient must take in order
to cooperate with the Invisible Helpers in their task of
reconstructing his system. ROSICRUCIAN HEALING 445 EFFLUVIA TRANSMITTED IN WEEKLY REPORT Before the Invisible Helpers can work with the
patient they must have effluvia from his vital body,
which is the etheric counterpart of the physical body and
the operating sphere of the vital forces. The effluvia are
obtained by having the patient write every week a letter
consisting of a few words or a few lines with pen and
ink. This is important as a pen charged with fluid is a
greater conductor of magnetism than a dry pencil. The
ether which thus impregnates the paper upon which the
patient writes week by week gives an indication of his
condition at that particular time and furnishes an
entrance key to his system. It is something which he has
given voluntarily and for the express purpose of
furnishing access for the Invisible Helpers. Unless the
patient does his part in this respect, the Invisible Helpers
are unable to do anything for him; so it may be seen that
it is of the utmost importance to keep up the weekly
letters to Headquarters.
TIME REQUIRED FOR CURE Instantaneous cures are frequent where the Invisible
Helpers are called upon to assist in cases of acute
disease. In the case of a chronic ailment which is of long
standing and has taken years to develop, a certain
amount of relief may be experienced immediately.
Complete recovery, however, which is equivalent to a
renewal of the whole system, can usually be achieved 446 ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS only in gradual stages. As said before, the healing work
of the Invisible Helpers is not suppression of symptoms
but reconstruction of the whole system, and in order to
be accomplished it requires time as well as the patient's
faithful and constant cooperation along the lines
indicated above.
HEALING MEETINGS AT HEADQUARTERS Healing meetings are held at Rosicrucian
Headquarters on the nights when the Moon enters
cardinal signs in the zodiac. The hour of service is about
6:30 Plutão .M. The virtue of the cardinal signs is dynamic
energy which they infuse into every enterprise started
under their influence, and therefore the healing thoughts
of the helpers all over the world are endowed with added
power when launched upon their errands of mercy under
this cardinal influence.
If you would like to join in this work, sit down
quietly when the clock in your place of residence points
to the given hour, 6:30 Plutão .M., meditate on health, and
pray to the Great Physician, our Father in Heaven, for
the restoration to health of all who suffer, particularly
those who have applied to Headquarters.
At the same time visualize the Ecclesia, the healing
Temple at Headquarters, where the thoughts of all
aspirants are finally gathered by the Elder Brothers and
used for the stated purpose. INDEX
