INDEX EXTRACT FROM A STATEMENT BY
THE TIBETAN
Suffice it to say, that I am a Tibetan disciple of a certain degree, and this
tells you but little, for all are disciples from the humblest aspirant up to, and
beyond, the Christ Himself. I live in a physical body like other men, on the
borders of Tibet, and at times (from the exoteric standpoint) preside over a
large group of Tibetan lamas, when my other duties permit. It is this fact
that has caused it to be reported that I am an abbot of this particular
lamasery. Those associated with me in the work of the Hierarchy (and all
true disciples are associated in this work) know me by still another name
and office. A.A.B. knows who I am and recognises me by two of my
names.
I am a brother of yours, who has travelled a little longer upon the Path than
has the average student, and has therefore incurred greater responsibilities. I
am one who has wrestled and fought his way into a greater measure of light
than has the aspirant who will read this article, and I must therefore act as a
transmitter of the light, no matter what the cost. I am not an old man, as age
counts among the teachers, yet I am not young or inexperienced. My work
is to teach and spread the knowledge of the Ageless Wisdom wherever I can
find a response, and I have been doing this for many years. I seek also to
help the Master M. and the Master K.H. whenever opportunity offers, for I
have been long connected with Them and with Their work. In all the above,
I have told you much; yet at the same time I have told you nothing which
would lead you to offer me that blind obedience and the foolish devotion
which the emotional aspirant offers to the Guru and Master Whom he is as
yet unable to contact. Nor will he make that desired contact until he has
transmuted emotional devotion into unselfish service to humanity-not to the
Master.
The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their
acceptance. They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertain their truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition.
Neither I nor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as
inspired writings, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as
being the work of one of the Masters. If they present truth in such a way
that it follows sequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings,
if the information given raises the aspiration and the will-to-serve from the
plane of the emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters
can be found) then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching
conveyed calls forth a response from the illumined mind of the worker in
the world, and brings a flashing forth of his intuition, then let that teaching
be accepted. But not otherwise. If the statements meet with eventual
corroboration, or are deemed true under the test of the Law of
Correspondences, then that is well and good. But should this not be so, let
not the student accept what is said. August 1934 THE GREAT INVOCATION
From the point of Light within the Mind of God
Let light stream forth into the minds of men.
Let Light descend on Earth.
From the point of Love within the Heart of God
Let love stream forth into the hearts of men.
May Christ return to Earth.
From the centre where the Will of God is known
Let purpose guide the little wills of men—
The purpose which the Masters know and serve.
From the centre which we call the race of men
Let the Plan of Love and Light work out.
And may it seal the door where evil dwells.
Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth.
“The above Invocation or Prayer does not belong to any person or
group but to all Humanity. The beauty and the strength of this Invocation
lies in its simplicity, and in its expression of certain central truths which
all men, innately and normally, accept—the truth of the existence of a
basic Intelligence to Whom we vaguely give the name of God; the truth
that behind all outer seeming, the motivating power of the universe is
Love; the truth that a great Individuality came to earth, called by
Christians, the Christ, and embodied that love so that we could
understand; the truth that both love and intelligence are effects of what is
called the Will of God; and finally the self-evident truth that only through
humanity itself can the Divine Plan work out.”
ALICE A. BAILEY CHAPTER I - The Zodiac and the Rays
[3] What I have to say first on this subject is entirely of a preliminary nature.
I seek to lay the ground for a somewhat new approach—a far more esoteric
approach—to the science of astrology. Certain things I may say will probably
be regarded by the academic and uninspired astrologer as revolutionary, or as
erroneous, as improbable or unprovable. As yet, however, astrology has not
really proved itself to the world of thought and science, in spite of many
definitely demonstrable successes. I would ask all of you, therefore, who read
and study this section of A Treatise on the Seven Rays to bear in mind the
above comments and to preserve a willingness to consider hypotheses and to
make an effort to weigh a theory or suggestion and to test out conclusions
over the course of a few years. If you can do this, there may come to you an
awakening of the intuition which will translate modern astrology into
something of real moment and significance to the world. It is intuitional
astrology which must eventually supersede what is today called astrology,
thus bringing about a return to the knowledge of that ancient science which
related the constellations and our solar system, drew attention to the nature of
the zodiac and informed humanity as to the basic inter-relations [ Júpiter ] which
govern and control the phenomenal and subjective worlds. 1. Three Basic Statements.
The statement is frequently made that astrology is an exact science but that is
far from correct in spite of the many mathematical computations. Astrology is
based, curiously enough, upon illusion for, as well you know, the zodiac is
naught but the imaginary path of the sun through the heavens, and this as it
appears from the standpoint of our totally insignificant planet. The sun is not,
as stated, in any sign of the zodiac. It simply appears to be so as it passes
between our little sphere, the Earth, and the constellations at any particular
time or season.
In ancient days it was believed that the earth was the centre of the solar
system and that around it revolved the sun and all the other planets. This was
the exoteric knowledge and position, though not the esoteric understanding. Later, when further discoveries brought more light to the human mind, our
planet was decentralised and the truth was more clearly seen, though much
remains as yet to be discovered and may even be of as revolutionary a nature.
From certain astrological angles, a similar process of decentralisation must
take place and the solar system must no longer be regarded as a point around
which the zodiac revolves or through which the sun passes in its great cycle of
approximately 25,000 years. Astrologers with insight may deny that this is the
commonly accepted attitude. Yet—for purposes of clarity and in connection
with the general public—the inference is permitted and accepted by the
ignorant. Upon this theory anent the zodiac rests very largely what we call the
Great Illusion, and I would have [5] you bear this in mind as you study with
me the newer approaches of this greatest and oldest of all the sciences.
Astrology is a science which must be restored to its original beauty and truth
before the world can gain a truer perspective and a more just and accurate
appreciation of the divine Plan, as it is expressed at this time through the
Wisdom of the Ages.
The second statement which I would make is that astrology is essentially the
purest presentation of occult truth in the world at this time, because it is the
science which deals with those conditioning and governing energies and
forces which play through and upon the whole field of space and all that is
found within that field. When this fact is grasped and the sources of those
energies are better comprehended and the nature of the field of space is
correctly understood, we shall then see a far wider and at the same time a
more closely related horizon; the relationships between individual, planetary,
systemic and cosmic entities will be grasped, and we shall then begin to live
scientifically. It is this scientific living which it is the immediate purpose of
astrology to bring about.
At present, the position of the average believer in astrology is that he is an
individual of importance (at least to himself), that he is living on that
important planet, the Earth (important to humanity), and that, through
astrology, he can discover his destiny and know what he ought to do. In
making this comment, I do not refer to those few astrologers who possess real
esoteric knowledge. They are few in number indeed, and only a handful of them are to be found practising at this time. The modern investigator likes to
believe that on him impinge and through him flow all those energies which
come from the sign in which the sun “finds” itself at the time of his birth. He
regards himself [6] also as responsive to the forces of the various planets as
they govern the houses in his horoscope and he believes that his life trends
and circumstances are thus determined. This makes him feel himself to be a
factor of isolated importance. Modern interpretations fail to emphasise the
importance of the rising sign (the ascendant) and this has been due to the fact
that few have been as yet ready to function as souls; small allowance has been
made for the energies which play upon our planet all the time from other
constellations or from the many “hidden” planets. Of these, the Ageless
Wisdom claims that there are around seventy in our solar system.
I desire to give you a truer and more accurate picture. This has now become
possible because group awareness, group relations and group integrity are
coming to the fore in the human consciousness. As this takes place, the
personality which is individual, separative and self-centred will recede
increasingly into the background, and the soul, non-separative, group
conscious and inclusive, will come more and more to the fore. Interest,
therefore, in the individual horoscope will gradually die out, and increasingly
the planetary, the systemic and the universal picture will stand out in the
awareness of the individual; he will then regard himself only as an integral
part of a far more important whole and his world group will interest him far
more than himself, as an individual.
I shall not, therefore, deal with the subject of esoteric astrology from the
standpoint of the horoscope at all. Universal relationships, the interplay of
energies, the nature of what lies behind the Great Illusion, the deluding
“Appearances of things as they are,” and the destiny of our planet, of the
kingdoms in nature and of humanity as a whole—these will constitute the
major part of our theme.
[7] It is immaterial to me whether modern astrologers accept or reject these
presented ideas. I will endeavour to give you certain facts as the Hierarchy
recognises them; I will indicate, if I can, the subjective realities of which the outer illusion is but the phenomenal appearance, conditioned by men’s
thoughts throughout the ages; I will emphasise the fact of the livingness of the
Sources from which all the energies and forces which play upon our planet
flow and emanate; I will endeavour, above all else, to demonstrate to you that
all-pervading unity and that underlying synthesis which is the basis of all
religions and of all the many transmitted forces; I will seek to remove you, as
individuals, from out of the centre of your own stage and consciousness and
—without depriving you of individuality and of self-identity—yet show you
how you are part of a greater whole of which you can become consciously
aware when you can function as souls, but of which you are today
unconscious, or at least only registering and sensing the inner reality in which
you live and move and have your being.
This brings me to the third statement, which is so basic and fundamental that I
would ask you to pause and contemplate it, even though you grasp not its full
implications as yet. The Ancient Wisdom teaches that “space is an entity.” It
is with the life of this entity and with the forces and energies, the impulses
and the rhythms, the cycles and the times and seasons that esoteric astrology
deals. H. Plutão .B. stated this in The Secret Doctrine . I would remind you that there
is an astrological key to The Secret Doctrine which cannot yet be given in
completeness. I can, however, give you some hints and suggest some lines of
approach, and these, if carried in the consciousness of the illumined
astrologers, may enable one of them at a later date to discover that key and
then—turning it on behalf of humanity—[8] reveal the fourth great
fundamental of the Ageless Wisdom of which three are already given in the
proem of The Secret Doctrine .
Space is an entity and the entire “vault of heaven” (as it has been poetically
called) is the phenomenal appearance of that entity. You will note that I did
not say the material appearance, but the phenomenal appearance. Speculation
about the nature, the history and identity of that entity is useless and of no
value. Some dim idea, providing analogy even when eluding specifications,
might be gained if you will endeavour to think of the human family, the fourth
kingdom in nature, as an entity, as constituting a single unit, expressing itself
through the many diversified forms of man. You, as an individual, are an integral part of humanity, yet you lead your own life, you react to your own
impressions, you respond to exterior influences and impacts, and in your turn
you emanate influences, send forth some form of character radiation and
express some quality or qualities. You thereby, and in some measure, affect
your environment and those whom you contact. Yet all the while you remain
part of a phenomenal entity to which we give the name of humanity . Now
extend this idea to a greater phenomenal entity, the solar system. This entity is
itself an integral part of a still greater life which is expressing Itself through
seven solar systems, of which ours is one. If you can grasp this idea, a vague
picture of a great underlying esoteric truth will emerge into your
consciousness. It is the life and the influence, the radiations and emanations of
this entity, and their united effect on our planetary life, the kingdoms in nature
and the unfolding human civilizations, which we shall have briefly to
consider.
The subject is so vast that I have been faced with the problem of the best
method whereby to handle it. I decided [ Mercúrio ] on brevity, the concise statement
of facts (facts to those of us who are working on the inner side of life, but
which must rightly be only hypotheses to you) and the avoidance of detail and
of detailed discussion. We will endeavour to work from the universal to the
particular and from the general to the specific, but our emphasis will always
be on the universal and the general, and not upon the particular and specific. It
will rest with those of you who are students of astrology to make due
application of the truth to the specific. It is definitely in this connection that
modern astrology has gone astray. It has reversed the true and right procedure
and has laid the emphasis upon the specific and particular, upon the personal
horoscope and the individual destiny, and has not laid the emphasis upon the
great energies and their Source. These sources are ultimately responsible for
the manifestation of the specific. This position and presentation of truth must
be altered.
In esoteric astrology we are, therefore, dealing with the Life and Lives which
inform the “points of light” within the universal Life. Constellations, solar
systems, planets, kingdoms in nature and microscopic man are all of them the
result of the activity and the manifestation of energy of certain Lives whose cycle of expression and whose infinite purposes lie outside the comprehension
of the most advanced and illumined minds on our planet.
The next point for each of you to grasp is the fact that the ether of space is the
field in and through which the energies from the many originating Sources
play. We are, therefore, concerned with the etheric body of the planet, of the
solar system, and of the seven solar systems of which our system is one, as
well as with the general and vaster etheric body of the universe in which we
are located. I employ the word “located” here with deliberation and because
[10] of the inferences to which it leads. This vaster field, as well as the
smaller and more localised fields, provides the medium of transmission for all
the energies which play upon and through our solar system, our planetary
spheres and all forms of life upon those spheres. It forms one unbroken field
of activity in constant ceaseless motion—an eternal medium for the exchange
and transmission of energies.
In connection with this, and in order more correctly to understand, it will be
useful to study individual man; in this way we can arrive at a faint
comprehension of the basic and underlying truth. Students should never forget
the Law of Analogy as an interpretive agency. Esotericism teaches (and
modern science is rapidly arriving at the same conclusion) that underlying the
physical body and its comprehensive and intricate system of nerves is a vital
or etheric body which is the counterpart and the true form of the outer and
tangible phenomenal aspect. It is likewise the medium for the transmission of
force to all parts of the human frame and the agent of the indwelling life and
consciousness. It determines and conditions the physical body, for it is itself
the repository and the transmitter of energy from the various subjective
aspects of man and also from the environment in which man (both inner and
outer man) finds himself.
Two other points should here be added. First: the individual etheric body is
not an isolated and separated human vehicle but is, in a peculiar sense, an
integral part of the etheric body of that entity which we have called the human
family; this kingdom in nature, through its etheric body, is an integral part of
the planetary etheric body; the planetary etheric body is not separated off from the etheric bodies of other planets but all of them in their totality, along
with the etheric body of the sun constitute the etheric [11] body of the solar
system. This is related to the etheric bodies of the six solar systems which,
with ours, form a cosmic unity and into these pour energies and forces from
certain great constellations. The field of space is etheric in nature and its vital
body is composed of the totality of etheric bodies of all constellations, solar
systems and planets which are found therein. Throughout this cosmic golden
web there is a constant circulation of energies and forces and this constitutes
the scientific basis of the astrological theories. Just as the forces of the planet
and of the inner spiritual man (to mention only one factor among many) pour
through the etheric body of the individual man upon the physical plane, and
condition his outer expression, activities, and qualities, so do the varying
forces of the universe pour through every part of the etheric body of that
entity we call space and condition and determine the outer expression, the
activities and qualities of every form found within the cosmic periphery.
The second point I would make is that within the human etheric body there
are to be found seven major force centres which are in the nature of
distributing agencies and electrical batteries, providing dynamic force and
qualitative energy to the man; they produce definite effects upon his outer
physical manifestation. Through their constant activity his quality appears, his
ray tendencies begin to emerge and his point in evolution is clearly indicated.
This “control of form through a septenate of energies” (as it is defined in the
Old Commentary ) is an unalterable rule in the inner government of our
universe and of our particular solar system, as well as in the case of individual
man. There are, for instance, in our solar system, seven sacred planets which
correspond to the seven individual force centres in man, the seven solar
systems, of which [12] our solar system is one, and in their turn the seven
energy centres of the One to Whom I have referred in my other books as the
One About Whom Naught Can Be Said.
Much has been given in the occult books of which the average astrologer
remains profoundly unaware. It is essential that he learns to think in larger
Wholes and to be more deeply concerned with the emanating Sources and with the eternal persistent Causes than with the effects of these Sources upon
that ephemeral creation, a human being and his temporary existence upon a
most unimportant planet. As he seeks to do this, he will discover for himself
the signs of the essential divinity of man—a divinity which is to be found in
the infinite grasp of man’s consciousness when illumined by the light of the
soul and in his power to project his thought into the consciousness of those
manifold Lives Whose “energetic movements” he must perforce share
because his small modicum of energy is an integral part of Theirs.
There is one aspect of energy for which the modern astrologer makes very
little allowance, and yet it is of paramount importance. This is the energy
which emanates from or radiates from the Earth itself. Living as all human
beings do upon the surface of the Earth and being, therefore, projected into
the etheric body of the planet (for the reason that “man stands erect”) man’s
body is at all times bathed in the emanations and the radiations of our Earth
and in the integral quality of our planetary Logos as He sends forth and
transmits energy within His planetary environment. Astrologers have always
emphasised the incoming influences and energies as they beat upon and play
through our little planet, but they have omitted to take into adequate
consideration the emanating qualities and forces which are the contribution of
our Earth’s etheric [13] body to the larger whole. This we will consider later,
but I felt the necessity of calling your attention to it at this time.
Another point which should here be noted is that the influence of the moon is
purely symbolic in nature and in effect and is simply the result of ancient
thought and teaching (descended to us from Lemurian times) and is not based
upon any true radiation or influence. In those far off times, antedating even
Lemuria and constituting in Lemurian days simply an ancient tradition, the
moon appeared to be a living vital entity. But I would have you bear definitely
in mind that today the moon is nothing more than a dead form. It has no
emanation and no radiation of any kind and, therefore, has no effect of any
kind. The moon, from the angle of the esoteric knower, is simply an
obstruction in space—an undesirable form which must some day disappear. In
esoteric astrology, the effect of the moon is noted as a thought effect and as
the result of a powerful and most ancient thoughtform; nevertheless, the moon has no quality of her own and can transmit nothing to the Earth. Let me
reiterate: The moon is a dead form; it has no emanation at all. That is why the
moon is spoken of in the ancient teaching as “veiling either Vulcan or
Uranus.” This hint or inference has always been here and astrologers would
do well to experiment with this suggestion I have made anent the moon and
(instead of working with the moon) let them work with Vulcan when dealing
with the undeveloped or average man and with Uranus when considering the
highly developed man. They would find some interesting and convincing
results eventuate.
Students would also do well to remember that the twelve constellations which
constitute our particular zodiac are themselves the recipients of many streams
of energy coming to them from many sources. These blend and fuse with the
[14] energy of any particular constellation and—transmuted and “occultly
refined”—eventually find their way into our solar system.
I would like to call attention, at this point, to some comments I made in A
Treatise on Cosmic Fire which are apposite and helpful. I am somewhat
paraphrasing:
“Astrology is concerned with the effect produced in the substance of the
sheaths by the influences, vibrations, etc., of the various planets. These are,
esoterically, the influences of the solar centres. The forces, emanating from
the solar centres, play upon the planetary centres.... This is hidden in the
karma of the Heavenly Man. When true esoteric astrology comes into
being, more anent this will be given. Astrological students are today only
learning the ABC of this stupendous subject and are occupied with the
exoteric fringes of that great veil which has been thrown wisely over
planetary lore.”
(A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , p. 1051) The following is a list—incomplete but adequate for our purposes—of the
major influences which find their way from far distant Sources into our
planetary life and produce definite effects upon individual man and humanity
as a whole.
I. 1. The constellation of the Great Bear. 2. The Seven Sisters of the Pleiades. Gêmeos . III.
IV. 3. Sirius, the Dog Star.
1. The seven solar systems of which ours is one.
2. The seven sacred planets of which ours is not one.
3. The five non-sacred planets or “hidden” planets.
1. The seven planetary centres.
2. The seven centres of force in the human etheric body.
1. The twelve zodiacal constellations. [15] We thus have a ninefold energy impact. This is a major chart but it
should be remembered that there are other impacts of relative insignificance.
To these would be added other streams of energy which definitely play upon
and affect our planetary life, such as those coming from that great star,
Betelgeuse, or from Antares and other stupendous suns and solar systems
which are related to the constellations of the zodiac and whose force reaches
us through these constellations and not directly.
Besides these, it should be remembered that technically we should also add
the radiatory influence which comes direct to us from the planet, the Earth,
upon which we live. Then, and only then, can you have a fairly complete
analysis and picture of the energies to which the etheric body of man
(conditioning the physical body which is pre-eminently automatic and
negative in its reactions) must and does ever respond. An understanding of
that response and the conscious intelligent control of individual reactions are
supremely necessary to man but only become possible at a fairly advanced
stage of development and as he nears the Path (technically understood). Man
learns first of all to control his reactions to the planets as they rule and direct
his personality affairs from their different “stations” in the twelve houses of
his horoscope. There are two ways in which this is done:
First: By having the horoscope duly cast and then taking [16] steps to
determine what should be done to negate the planetary influences where it is
deemed desirable to control the personality reactions. This has to be done by
the applied power of thought. This necessitates complete confidence in the
understanding and interpretation of the astrologer and the recognition of the exact moment of birth. One wonders if these conditions of the exact moment
and the completely wise astrologer are ever to be found as yet.
Second: By consciously assuming the position of the spiritual Observer, and
by cultivating the power to respond to the Soul. Then, from the angle of that
Soul, the man must learn to control circumstance and the attendant reactions
of the personality.
The following attitudes and positions taken by the esoteric astrologer should
also be noted:
1. That the planetary influences indicate the trend of the outer life
circumstances. When correctly interpreted for the average man and for the
unevolved man, they can and do indicate the personality destiny and fate; they
do condition and completely control the man who has no conscious soul
experience. The moment that a man becomes aware of his own soul and is
endeavouring to control his own “path in life,” the influence of the planets,
per se, definitely weakens and steadily becomes less and less; his personality
chart appears inconclusive and often most inaccurate. It is the force flowing
through the planets and not the force of the planets themselves which then
governs and controls. The man then becomes receptive to the subtler and
higher energies of the solar system and of the twelve governing constellations.
2. That the Sun sign , as it is called, indicates the nature of the man, physical,
mental and spiritual. It holds the [17] secret of the personality ray and of the
man’s responsiveness or lack of responsiveness to the Soul, the real man. It
indicates also the integration already achieved and the present point of
unfoldment of the soul qualities, of the present available equipment, of the
present life quality and of the immediately possible group relations. It
indicates, from the angle of the Ageless Wisdom, nothing more. This is a
reversal of the usual astrological position. The reason that I proffer this is that
humanity is enough evolved so that the astrology of the soul will become
possible before long; it constitutes—from many points of view—a reversal of
normal procedure. This is both wise and necessary, and also inevitable.
Astrologers will eventually be divided into two classes: the exoteric astrologers who will be occupied with the horoscope of the personality, and
the esoteric astrologers who will be occupied with the purposes of the soul.
3. That the rising sign indicates the remoter possibilities, and the spiritual goal
and purpose of the immediate incarnation and of the immediate succeeding
incarnations. This sign concerns itself with the struggle of the spiritual man
“to carry on” from the point achieved so that when the life energy is
temporarily exhausted and the “death of the personality” takes place, the man
finds himself “nearer the centre of his life, closer to the centre of his group
and approaching the centre of divine life,” as the Ageless Wisdom expresses
it. This particular phrase “death of the personality” has two definite
connotations:
a. It may mean the death of the physical body, which is inevitably followed
by the two stages of the [18] death of the emotional vehicle and the
subsequent dissipation of the temporary and ever-changing form which
the quota of mental energy has assumed during incarnation.
b. The subjective and mystical “death of the personality.” This is a phrase
indicating the transfer of the focus for the distribution of energy from
the personality (a definite centre of force) to the soul (another definite
centre).
I realise that these concepts are not in line with the usual astrological
postulates. However, astrology would not be wasting time if it experimented
with these ideas for a while. Astrologers might discover some most interesting
and arresting problems and perhaps arrive at an accuracy which is at present
unknown. It might be of some service if I enlarged somewhat upon this point:
In connection with the sun sign, the rising sign and the effect of the
thoughtform relating to the moon, the position of esoteric astrology is as
follows:
1. The sun sign. —This sign indicates the present problem of the man; it sets
the pace or the established tempo of his personality life; it is related to quality,
temperament and the life tendencies which are seeking expression during this
particular incarnation, and it is suggestive of the rajasic or the activity aspect of the innate man. Fundamentally, the forces here found are indicative of the
line of least resistance.
2. The ascendant or rising sign indicates the intended life or immediate soul
purpose for this incarnation. It holds the secret of the future and presents the
force which, rightly used, will lead the man to success. It represents [19] the
sattvic or harmony aspect of life and can produce right relationship between
soul and personality in any one incarnation. It thus points the way to the
recognition of the force of the soul.
3. The moon .—This type of force (coming from certain planets and not from
the moon) indicates that which is past . It, therefore, summarises limitation
and the present handicaps. It governs the physical body and shows where the
prison of the soul is to be found.
The next statement which I would like to make, and which grows normally
out of the above, is that the zodiacal, the systemic and the planetary energies
act either as hindering or as stimulating forces, according to the type of
vehicle or body upon which they play; the nature of these vehicles and their
capacity to attract, to respond, to reject, to absorb and to transmute is entirely
dependent upon the point in evolution attained and also upon the general
planetary condition and psychology to be found in the human family at any
given time. An instance of the latter can be seen today in the world where the
forces, beating in an almost violent and somewhat new measure and tempo
upon our planetary life, are evoking a greatly intensified response from the
world thinkers, thus stimulating them to earnest effort along ideological lines
and, at the same time, are drawing forth from the masses and the little evolved
people nothing but terror, a miserable fatalism, widespread physical depletion
and many other undesirable reactions from the form nature. An understanding
of these hindering or stimulating effects can be easily grasped by those who
can comprehend the nature of the activities of the planet, Saturn. This is the
planet which conditions primarily the point in evolution where choice
definitely becomes possible, [20] where rejection of opportunity or its
acceptance can consciously be undertaken, and the shouldering of personal
responsibility becomes a recognised fact in a planned and ordered life. This point in the human evolutionary process is spoken of in the Old Commentary
in the following symbolic phrases:
“Amid the whirling forces, I stand confused. I know them not, for,
during all my past, they swept me up and down the land wherein I moved,
blinded and unaware. From place to place and point to point, they drove me
up and down the land and nowhere was there rest.
I know them now and here I stand and will not move until I know the
Law which governs all this movement up and down the land. I may revolve
and turning face the many different ways; I face some wide horizons and
yet today I stand.
I will determine for myself the way to go. Then onward I will move. I
will not travel up and down the land nor turn in space. But onward I will
move.”
There is another revolutionary idea which the esoteric science of astrology
brings to its modern and exoteric aspect: In the greater cycle of man’s many
incarnations, he—as is well recognised—passes through the zodiacal circle
from Pisces to Aries, thus retrograding through the signs as he follows the
sweep or path of the Sun’s retrogression. This phrase has always disturbed
me, but the apparent retrogression, based upon the precession of the
equinoxes, is all an integral part of the Great Illusion. The moment a man
begins to emerge out of that illusion and is no longer subject to the glamour
and to the effect of the world maya, that moment the motion of the great
Wheel of Life [21] is reversed and he then begins (slowly and laboriously) to
work in the opposite direction. He then passes through the signs from Aries to
Pisces. He begins patiently and consciously to function as a soul struggling
towards the light until finally he emerges at the end of the Path in Pisces as a
world Victor and a world Saviour. He then knows the significance of the
triumph over death because he has surmounted and overcome desire.
This reversal of the way a man travels through the signs of the zodiac will
necessitate a readjustment of the method employed by astrologers when they
are casting a horoscope of senior aspirants, of disciples and of initiates. According, therefore, to an individual’s point of evolution upon the Path or (in
other words) the individual’s place upon the wheel of life, the practising
astrologer will arrange the interpretation of the horoscope. It will require the
work and the thought of the intuitive astrologer, dependent upon soul contact
and much meditation, to determine the processes of astrological interpretation
for those who are active and living souls at some one or other of the final
stages upon the Path. The casting of the horoscope of the average man or the
undeveloped man presents no such difficulties.
It might be added in addition that the signs of the zodiac are concerned
primarily with the life expression of the Heavenly Man (as far as our planet is
concerned) and therefore with the destiny and life of the planetary Logos.
They are also concerned with the great man of the heavens , the solar Logos. I
refer in this last instance to their effect as it makes itself felt in the solar
system as a whole and with this effect there are few astrologers at this time fit
to deal. I would remind you that to the lives who inform these great
constellations and whose radiation [22] —dynamic and magnetic—reaches
our Earth, this effect is incidental and unnoticed. The primary effect that they
have is upon our planetary Logos and this effect reaches us through Him,
pouring through that great planetary centre to which we have given the name
of Shamballa. It is, therefore, capable of evoking the major response from the
monads, and these monads express themselves through the kingdom of souls
and through the human kingdom; it consequently expresses itself through the
Hierarchy and through humanity as a whole. This is a point of real importance
and should be noted and connected with all the teaching you have had upon
this most interesting theme of the three major planetary centres. It is the work
of the zodiacal influences to evoke the emergence of the will aspect of the
Heavenly Man and of all monads, souls and personalities who constitute the
planetary body of expression. This statement means but little to you today but
it will mean much to those students who, in a few decades, will study what I
am here saying. Properly understood, it accounts for much that is happening
in the world at this time.
As these influences pour through our planet and thence to the centres of force
upon the planet, they produce a dual effect: 1. They produce an effect upon advanced man, galvanising the centres
above the diaphragm into activity and enabling him to respond to the
radiation and the activity of the Hierarchy.
2. They produce an effect upon unevolved man, enabling him to function
as an ordinary, unenlightened human being.
It should be noted here, however, that all the energies—zodiacal, systemic,
and planetary—have a definite effect [23] upon all the lives in all forms in all
kingdoms of nature. Nothing can escape these radiatory and magnetic
influences. The goal of evolution for humanity is to become consciously and
livingly aware of the nature of these energies and begin to know them and to
use them. This is the field of occultism as the Hierarchy has always told men.
It might be stated that the disciple has to become consciously aware of the
planetary influences and begin to use them for the carrying out of soul
purpose. The initiate has to be aware of the zodiacal influences which
emanate from outside of the solar system altogether. These can be recognised
as
a. A vibration, registered in one or other of the seven centres.
b. A revelation of a particular type of light, conveying a specific colour to
the initiate.
c. A peculiar note.
d. A directional sound.
The whole story of the zodiac can be picturesquely yet accurately summed up
in the following statement: There are three books which the three types of
human beings study and from which they learn:
1. The Book of Life—Initiates—the 12 constellations.
2. The Book of Wisdom—Disciples—the 12 planets.
3. The Book of Form or of Manifestation—Humanity—the 12 Creative
Hierarchies.
In summation, it might be said that:
1. The zodiacal signs affect primarily the man who lives below the
diaphragm. This is the ordinary average man. These signs thus condition four of the centres: [24]
a.The base of the spine.
b. The sacral centre.
c. The solar plexus centre.
d. The spleen.
2. The inner group of solar systems, working in conjunction with the
zodiacal signs, affect primarily those who live above the diaphragm.
They, therefore, condition:
a. The heart centre.
b. The throat centre.
c. The ajna centre.
d. The head centre.
3. Three of the energies work through the head centre but only after the
third initiation.
There are one or two other points which might be noted here also. I note them
for your enlightenment. Out of all the many energies which impinge upon,
pass through and produce effects upon our planet, esoteric astrology
emphasises the following four types of force because they affect what might
be called the personality of our Earth:
1. The quality of our solar system. God is a consuming fire but God is also
love. This is the teaching of both esoteric and exoteric truth.
2. The quality of the Logos of our planet as it pours through the chains, the
rounds, the races, and the kingdoms of nature.
3. The quality of the Earth’s complementary planet, which is the Earth’s
polar opposite, esoterically considered. This planet is Venus. Júpiter . The quality of the attraction of the three planets which produce an
esoteric triangle of force.
[25] I have several times used the phrase “pass through” the centres and
forms. This concept necessitates the idea of distributing centres to which the
incoming energies may go and from which they may pass out again as
radiation. Some idea of this might be grasped if I gave you the new proposition (new to you though old to esotericists) of the centres in the human
etheric body. The four centres above the diaphragm—the heart, throat, ajna
and head centres—are basically and primarily receiving centres. The centres
below the diaphragm—the base of the spine, the sacral, solar plexus and
spleen centres—are galvanised into activity by the four higher receiving
centres. This, when accomplished, demonstrates as personality and physical
magnetism and influence until the time comes when there is a reversal in the
way of passing—as a soul—around the zodiac. This is symbolised as the
revolution of the sun around the zodiac from Aries to Pisces instead of the
reverse movement, from Aries to Taurus. This is repeated in the human frame
and the four lower centres eventually return that which has come to them.
They thus reverse the process normally followed and the centres above the
diaphragm become radio-active, dynamic and magnetic. This is an intricate
occult study and is concerned with the response of the etheric body to the
incoming energies. It relates finally the lowest centre at the base of the spine
to the highest centre, the head centre. This is a correspondence to the relation
of the Earth to the Sun. Think this out.
As we work and study over these matters, let us bear in mind always the fact
that we are considering the seven rays and their inter-relations in the cosmic
process. We are concerned esoterically with:
1. The seven rays and the twelve signs of the zodiac. [26]
2. The seven rays and the twelve Creative Hierarchies.
3. The seven rays and the planets as they govern the twelve houses of
expression.
As we ponder and think and as we correlate the various aspects of the
teaching, we shall find three propositions emerging which govern the inflow
of life to the planet and to the individual man. These have been laid down
earlier in A Treatise on the Seven Rays but it might profit us to state them
here:
Proposition One—Every ray life is an expression of a solar life and every
planet is therefore:
1. Linked with every other planetary life. 2. Animated by energy pouring into it from the seven solar systems, of
which ours is one.
3. Actuated by three streams of force:
a. Coming from solar systems other than our own.
b. Our own solar system.
c. Our own planetary life.
Proposition Two—Each one of the ray lives is the recipient and the
custodian of energies coming from
1. The seven solar systems.
2. The twelve constellations.
Proposition Three—It is the quality of a ray life—manifesting in time and
space—which determines the phenomenal appearance.
Before we penetrate further into the consideration of our theme, I would like
to emphasise two points:
First of all, that we are considering esoteric influences and not astrology, per
se. Our subject is the seven rays and [27] their relationship to the zodiacal
constellations or—in other words—the interaction of the seven great Lives
which inform our solar system with the twelve constellations which compose
our zodiac.
Secondly, that we have necessarily to study these energies and their interplay
from the angle of their effect upon the planet, and incidentally, their effect
upon the forms in the various kingdoms of nature and particularly in
connection with the fourth kingdom, the human, and with individual man—
average man, the disciple and the initiate.
We shall enter into no definitions in connection with technical astrology, nor
shall I use the many technical terms. If, in the presentation of this vast subject,
and in the process of indicating the attitude of the Ageless Wisdom to this
new and coming (yet very ancient) “science of effective energies,” as it has
been called, I may present a new approach, or point out an unsuspected
relation and from the standpoint of the Ageless Wisdom correct what are
deemed errors by the Teachers on the inner side of life, I am hoping that some astrologers may be found who will be sensitive to that which is new. I am
believing that there are investigators along astrological lines who will be
open-minded enough to recognise possible hypotheses and then to make fair
experiment with them. May I repeat: I am not writing a treatise upon
astrology, but one upon the seven rays and their equivalent and corresponding
energies, upon the effects of ray energy and the interplay of these energies
with, and their effect upon, the various planetary forces, particularly those of
the Earth. I am looking for these fair-minded astrologers to make due
experiment with the factors and suggestions which I may indicate. With this
in mind, let us proceed.
[28] I have pointed out that these energies fall into three groups:
1. Those coming from certain great constellations which are to be found
active in relation to our solar system and which, from the most ancient
days, have always been related in myth and legend to our system. To
these constellations, ours is related in a peculiar way.
2. Those coming from the twelve zodiacal constellations. These are
recognised as having a definite effect upon our system and our
planetary life.
3. Those coming from the planets found within the periphery of the Sun’s
sphere of influence.
From a certain point of view, one can generalise largely and say that these are
the correspondences in the solar system to the three great centres of force
which produce and control manifestation and evolutionary progress in the
human being:
1. The great exterior, yet controlling, constellations are analogous to that
centre of force which we call the Monad and to its universal will-topower which is distinctive of the first divine aspect.
2. The twelve constellations might be regarded as embodying the soul
aspect and, for the present, their effect upon the individual must be
regarded and should be studied in terms of consciousness and of the
development of the life of the soul. This is in essence the will-to-love . 3. The planets, twelve in number (seven sacred planets and five nonsacred), are effective (using the word in a technical sense) in relation to
the external life, environment and circumstances of the individual.
Their force contacts should be interpreted largely in terms of the human
[29] personality, the third divine aspect. They thus exemplify the willto-know .
I would have you remember that I am talking entirely in terms of
consciousness and of the responses and reactions of the individual to the
forces which impinge upon him. The effect of the emanation of our planet, the
Earth, is a correspondence to the effect of that aggregate of atoms and
molecules which we call the dense physical body and of its response to the
pull and the attraction of any or all of the subtler bodies.
As regards the influence of the seven solar systems, I should suggest (more I
cannot do) that they are linked up astrologically with the constellations, the
Great Bear, the Pleiades, and Sirius. They are intimately related to them, but
their exact effect is a transmitted one and cannot be noted as producing
noticeable results, as yet, upon humanity and the other kingdoms in nature.
The effect of the three great constellations also cannot be noted by individual
man until such time as he becomes conscious of the monadic vibration, after
the third initiation. There are many potent influences playing upon our solar
system and the planet all the time but—as far as man is concerned—his
response apparatus and his mechanism of reaction remain what is called
“occultly unresponsive,” for they are not yet of a quality which will permit
any noticeable recognition, either in the dense or subtler vehicles or even by
the soul. Later in the evolutionary process, recognition and response will
come, but for all astrological purposes and recognisable produced effects,
they may be regarded today as non-existent except as they react upon the
fourth kingdom of nature as it constitutes a living unit in the body of the
planetary Logos. As little conscious effect is produced by these forces as the
effect of a [30] high moment of contact in your morning meditation produces
an effect upon the atom or cell in the little finger upon one of your hands.
There may be a general response and stimulation throughout the entire body, but the intelligent atom makes no conscious response. The vibration is of too
high a character.
Speculation along these lines is profitless. A vast system of interlocking
energies is in active and rapid circulation throughout the whole cosmic etheric
body—of which our systemic etheric body is an integral part—but speculative
research along the indicated lines and the following of obscure trails are
utterly futile until the main highway of approach has been constructed and
followed. The general outline of the astrological way is all that is possible
today, until the time when man can think in larger wholes and has a more
synthetic capacity. We shall confine ourselves to the vast field of energies
which I have outlined for your consideration and shall consider only the major
forces which are in circulation. This will suffice for our day and generation.
We are concerned with energies which can and do evoke response and of
which man can be aware and, in many cases, is today aware.
It might be useful here to comment in a wide and general way, and with many
necessary reservations, upon the broad sweep of some of these responses:
1. Undeveloped humanity is primarily conditioned in its life and
circumstances by the influence of the lesser zodiac and thus by the
position of the planets in the twelve houses.
2. Average intelligent humanity and those nearing the Path of Discipleship
and upon the Probationary Path respond consciously to [31]
a. The planets, affecting their personalities.
b. The Sun sign, as indicating life trends which are already established
and which constitute the line of least resistance.
c. The rising sign in a small measure. This indicates the life goal for that
particular life cycle or else over a period of seven lives. The last two
constitute the Greater Zodiac.
3. Disciples and initiates can begin consciously to respond to all the above
influences, handling them constructively, plus those potent yet infinitely
subtle forces which pour into our solar system from the three major
constellations referred to above. In the early stages, the response is in the subtler bodies and the brain fails to register them, but after the third
initiation, there is a recognition of them upon the physical plane.
Bringing the theme back to the subject of this treatise, which is that of the
seven rays, I would point out that these rays have a close connection with the
seven stars of the Great Bear (again always the four and the three as a
secondary differentiation) and to the seven Sisters, the Pleiades. The first
constellation is the agent of positive force to the planetary Logos and the
other the relayer of the negative aspect. There is, therefore, a direct
interchange of energies between the lives of the seven planetary Logoi and the
stupendous and unfathomable Lives Who inform these major constellations.
Great interlocking triangles of force can be found existing between the seven
planets and these two groups of seven stars each. It will eventually be
discovered that the innermost secret of astrological deduction in the planetary
sense is connected with these “sacred triangles,” and they are—in their turn—
represented by the triangles [32] (shifting and changing) which can be
constructed in connection with the seven centres.
In casting the horoscope of the planet (which will some day be possible) it
will be found that the line of these forces and of our planetary response to
them is of a more potent effect than is the influence of the zodiacal
constellations upon the human unit. This is due to the immeasurably advanced
point in evolution of the planetary Spirits Who have (in Their individual lives)
largely transcended the influence of the twelve constellations and are
becoming rapidly responsive to the higher vibrations of their great Prototypes,
the “three intimate constellations,” as they have esoterically been called. This
is a correspondence in the lives of these great Entities to the manner in which
an advanced individual can offset the influence of the planets and thus so
dominate his personality life that prediction and certainty, as to activity and
circumstance, are no longer possible. The soul is dominating, and the planets
cease to condition the life. So it is with the constellations and the planetary
Logoi. They can offset the lower influences as They awaken to and respond to
the infinitely higher vibrations of the three major constellations. 2. The Creative Hierarchies. It might here be appropriate if I interpolated a chart or a tabulation which may
be found suggestive of some of these interlocking energies which play
through, traverse, return, stimulate and energise every part of our solar
system. They only evoke conscious response where the vehicle of expression
and of response is adequate to the impact, and this statement is true of the
solar Logos, the planetary Logoi, and of all forms in all the kingdoms upon
our planet. [33] Unconscious reaction will of course exist, but it will be on a
general or mass scale, and much of it pours through to us from these distant
constellations, via the fifth Creative Hierarchy. This Hierarchy, being on the
verge of liberation, is to be found on the intellectual level of consciousness
and can, therefore, be used as a focal point and a transmitter of the higher
energies to our solar system and to the planet. If you make a careful study of
the chart of the twelve Creative Hierarchies, page 34, you will note that this
Hierarchy is influencing, and is influenced by, the seventh Ray of Magical
Order and of Ceremonial Organisation. The basic function of this ray is to
relate spirit and matter and produce the manifested form. The sign of the
zodiac with which it is closely connected is that of Cancer, the Crab, which is
a mass sign and one of the “gates” into manifested life.
The following information anent the Hierarchies may prove useful. It has
been gathered from various sources.
I might here remind you that the seven planes of our solar system are the
seven subplanes of the cosmic physical plane. The four Creative Hierarchies
which have achieved liberation are now to be found focussed upon the cosmic
astral plane; hence their potency even when out of manifestation. The fifth
Creative Hierarchy exists on the highest etheric level and will join the other
four Hierarchies when the sixth Creative Hierarchy has measured up to
cosmic opportunity and is itself nearing liberation. The following is a
tabulation showing some of the astrological relationships in connection with
1. The constellation of the Great Bear.
2. The Pleiades or the Seven Sisters.
3. Sirius. Júpiter . The seven solar systems. [34] [35] [36] 1. The Hierarchy of Creative Powers is divided esoterically into seven ( Júpiter and 3) within the Twelve Great Orders.
2. Three Hierarchies are—in this greater cycle—of profound significance, the
fourth or human Creative Hierarchy and the two deva Hierarchies, the fifth
and the sixth.
3. The fourth Creative Hierarchy is in reality the ninth and that is why it is
called the Hierarchy of Initiates. This can be seen by referring to the chart. Júpiter . We are told in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire that in the ninth, tenth and
eleventh Hierarchies (counting from the bottom upwards) lies the clue to the
nature of Agni, the Lord of Fire, the sum total of systemic vitality.
5. Much light can come to the earnest student through a study of the numbers
connected with these Hierarchies.
a. The first 5 are regarded as pure abstractions.
b. Hierarchy One has the numbers—6.1.7.
Hierarchy Two has the numbers—7.2.6.
Hierarchy Three has the numbers—8.3.5.
Hierarchy Four has the numbers— Mercúrio . Júpiter . Júpiter .
Hierarchy Five has the numbers—10.5.3.
Hierarchy Six has the numbers—11.6.2.
Hierarchy Seven has the numbers—12.7.1.
It is necessary to take note of this as in The Secret Doctrine reference
will be found to the Hierarchies under different numbers. This serves
to conceal, but it will also confuse the student.
6. The first four Hierarchies achieved liberation in the first solar system. Their
influence reached our Earth through the medium of the fifth Creative
Hierarchy. [37]
7. These are, therefore, related to the four rays which work as minor rays of
Attribute under the great major third Ray of Active Intelligence.
8. Pisces is seen at the head of the list of zodiacal signs because it is
governing the present great astrological world cycle of 25,000 years. It was also one of the dominant signs, influencing our planet at the time of
individualisation when the human kingdom came into being. It is basically
related to the first or highest Creative Hierarchy which is, in its turn, related to
the third Ray of Active Intelligence. It was the product of the first solar
system. The development of illumination through an awakened intelligence is
the first goal of humanity. Mercúrio . The fifth Creative Hierarchy (also numbered 8) is on the verge of
liberation. It is peculiarly connected with the tenth Creative Hierarchy, with
the constellation Capricorn and with the human personality which veils and
temporarily hides the Christ principle behind both form and mind. Eight is,
under some numerical systems, regarded as the number of the Christ.
10. The Greater Builders and the Lesser Builders, working on the second and
third planes of our solar system, have their activities reflected in the work of
the Lunar Lords and the elemental lives.
11. You will note that the human Hierarchy (on chart Mercúrio -IV- Júpiter ) is assigned no
particular element as it has to fuse and synthesise them all. This is part of the
great tests of initiation under Scorpio.
12. This chart is drawn up in relation only to the fourth Creative Hierarchy,
the human. It is not drawn in relation to the other planetary manifestations.
[38] (The chart has been compiled from the very limited stock of
knowledge that has thus far been revealed on the subject, and it is as
correct as possible under the circumstances.)
Each of the seven Hierarchies of Beings, found within the Twelve, Who are
the Builders or the Attractive Agents are (in their degree) intermediaries; all
embody one of the types of force emanating from the seven constellations.
Their intermediary work, therefore, is dual:
1. They are the mediators between Spirit and matter.
2. They are the transmitters of force from sources extraneous to the solar
system to forms within the solar system.
Each of these groups of beings is likewise septenary in nature, and the fortynine fires of Brahma are the lowest manifestation of their fiery nature. Each group also may be regarded as “fallen” in the cosmic sense, because involved
in the building process, or the occupiers of forms of some degree of density or
another.
Hierarchy I. The first great Hierarchy is emanated from the Heart of the
central Spiritual Sun. It is the Son of God Himself, the First Born in a cosmic
sense, even as the Christ was the “Eldest in a vast family of brothers,” and the
“first flower on the human plant.” The symbol of this Hierarchy is the Golden
Lotus with its twelve petals folded. The Secret Doctrine I. 233-250. III. 565.
It should be remembered that this Hierarchy is literally the sixth, for five
hierarchies have passed on, being the product of the earlier system, that
wherein Intelligence or Manas was the goal. The five liberated Hierarchies are
in their totality the sum total of manas. It is the Hierarchy which is the fifth in
order, and which we are told is in [39] process of achieving final liberation, or
taking its fourth Initiation, which is the cause of certain phenomena upon our
planet which has merited our planet being called the “Star of Suffering.”
There is a karmic link between the animal kingdom and the fifth Creative
Hierarchy of the earlier system which makes itself felt in man in the necessary
crucifixion of the animal physical nature, particularly along sex lines. We
must remember that the Hierarchies work under the Law of Attraction; it is
the law of the Builders.
This first (sixth) Hierarchy has for its type of energy the first aspect of the
sixth type of cosmic electricity , and wields special power, therefore, in
conjunction with the lowest fire, or “fire by friction,” as it makes itself felt on
the sixth plane. These lives are called “the burning Sons of Desire” and were
the Sons of Necessity. It is said of them in the Old Commentary : “They
burned to know. They rushed into the spheres. They are the longing of the
Father for the Mother. Hence do they suffer, burn, and long through the sixth
sphere of sense.”
Hierarchy Gêmeos . The second Hierarchy is closely allied with the Great Bear. We
are told that They entered through the second ventricle within the Sacred
Heart, and are (as we are told in The Secret Doctrine ) the prototypes of the Monads. They are the source of monadic life, but They are not the Monads;
They are far higher.
This Hierarchy, which is literally the seventh, is the influx into our system of
those Lives who in the first solar system remained on their own plane, being
too sinless and holy to find opportunity in that very material and intellectual
evolution. Even in this, they will find it impossible to do more than influence
the incarnating Jivas, imparting to them ability to realise the nature of group
consciousness, the quality of the seven Heavenly Men, but not being able to
express [40] themselves fully. Some clues to this mystery will come if the
student carefully bears in mind that in our solar system and our seven planes,
we have only the physical body of the Logos, and that that physical body is a
limitation of the expression of His threefold nature. The first (sixth) Hierarchy
might be viewed as endeavouring to express the mental vibration of the solar
Logos and the second, His emotional, or cosmic astral, nature.
This second (seventh) Hierarchy has for its type of force the second aspect of
the seventh type of force from out of the many. Some idea of the relative point
in evolution of the solar Logos may be gained by study of the varying aspects
of force which He is demonstrating in this particular incarnation. It is this
energy which drives the Monads through into physical incarnation, for it
makes itself felt on the seventh plane. The energies which are functioning are
those which the Logos has unfolded, and are the gain of previous
incarnations. Gaps necessarily occur, and certain types of force are lacking
because He has as yet much cosmically to gain.
It is the energy of this Hierarchy which results in the manifestation of the
Divine Androgyne, and in the seven centres of force which are the seven
Spiritual Energies.
Hierarchy III. The third Creative Hierarchy (or the eighth) is a peculiarly
interesting one. They are called “the Triads” for They hold in themselves the
potencies of triple evolution, mental, psychical, and spiritual. These Triads of
Life are inherently the three Persons of the Trinity and the flower of the
earlier system from a certain angle. From another angle, when studied as the
“flower of the earlier Eight,” They are the eightfold points awaiting opportunity to flame forth. They are the devas who are ready for service,
which is to give to another Hierarchy certain [41] qualities which are lacking.
This Hierarchy is regarded as the great donors of immortality whilst
Themselves “standing aloof from incarnation.” Lords of Sacrifice and Love
are They, but They cannot pass out of the logoic etheric body into the dense
physical vehicle.
This third Hierarchy wields the third aspect of electric force of the first type
of cosmic energy. They stand for a recurrent cycle of that first type
symbolised by the number 8. The formulae for these electrical energies are
too complicated to be given here, but the student should bear in mind that
these Hierarchies express:
1. Septenary cosmic energy.
2. Cosmic prana.
3. Solar energy or electric fire, solar fire and fire by friction.
Each Hierarchy manifests a triple energy or an aspect of each of the above,
and that necessitates a ninefold differentiation, for the two first are triple, as is
the third. It is the rejection of the Triadal lives by units in the fourth
Hierarchy, that of the human Monads, which precipitates a man eventually
into the eighth sphere. He refuses to become a Christ, a Saviour and remains
self-centred.
We have dealt with the first three Hierarchies which are regarded as ever
“seeing the Face of the Ruler of the Deep,” or as being so pure and holy that
Their forces are in realised contact with Their emanating source.
We now take up for brief consideration two Hierarchies which closely
concern ourselves, the human self-conscious entities. These two groups are
literally three, as the fifth Hierarchy is a dual one, and it is this which has led
to some confusion and is the occult significance behind the ill-omened
number thirteen. They are the “Seekers of satisfaction” and the cause of the
second fall into generation, the fact [42] behind the taking of a lower nature
by the Ego. The fourth and the fifth Hierarchies are the ninth and tenth, or the
“Initiates” and the “Perfect Ones.” All human beings, or “Imperishable Jivas,”
are those who evolve through a graded series of initiations, either self-induced or brought about on our planet with extraneous aid. They achieve through a
“marriage” with the order next to them, the fifth. They are then completed or
perfected, and it is owing to this occult fact that the fourth Hierarchy is
regarded as masculine and the fifth as feminine.
Hierarchy IV. The fourth Creative Hierarchy is the group wherein the highest
aspect of man, his “Father in Heaven” finds place. These lives are the points
of fire who must become the flame; this they do through the agency of the
fifth Hierarchy and the four wicks, or the two dual lower hierarchies. Thus it
can be seen that where man is concerned, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
Hierarchies are, during the cycle of incarnation, his very self. They are the
“Lords of Sacrifice” and “Lords of Love,” the flower of Atma-Buddhi.
In studying these Hierarchies, one of the most valuable lessons to be learned
is the place and importance of man in the scheme. The Hierarchy, for
instance, which is the essence of the intangible Life of Spirit, the principle of
Buddhi, is the esoteric cause of the cosmic marriage of spirit and matter,
based on the love and desire of the Logos, but each Hierarchy also expresses
itself through one particular manifestation which comes to be regarded by the
finite mind of man as the Hierarchy itself. This is not so, and care must be
taken to distinguish between these Hierarchies.
They are latent germs of force centres and manifest subjectively; they warm
and vitalise groups of forms; they [43] flower forth and express themselves
through the medium of a form, or another Hierarchy. These Hierarchies are all
interrelated and are negative or positive to each other, as the case may be.
As is stated in The Secret Doctrine , I. 238, this Hierarchy is the nursery for
the incarnating Jivas; and it carried in it the germs of the Lives which
achieved the human stage in another solar system, but were not able to
proceed beyond that owing to the coming in of pralaya, which projected them
into a state of latency. The condition of the Hierarchy is similar, only on a
cosmic scale, to the condition of the seeds of human life held in a state of
obscuration during an interchain period. The three other Hierarchies dealt
with (first, second and third) were those who have (in previous kalpas of
logoic manifestation) passed beyond the human stage altogether. They are, therefore, the arupa or formless groups, as the remaining are the rupa groups
or those having forms.
The fourth Creative Hierarchy, or the ninth, must ever be regarded in this
solar system as occupying what might be considered as the third place,
First, the Lives or the three Persons of the Trinity.
Second, the Prototypes of man, the seven Spirits.
Third, man or the lowest manifestation of the self-conscious Spirit aspect.
This needs to be carefully considered and has no reference to the form aspect
but solely to the nature of the Lives expressing themselves through other lives
who are also self-conscious , or fully intelligent. This, certain of the
Hierarchies are not.
The four lower Hierarchies are all concerned with manifestation [44] in the
three worlds, or in the dense physical body of the solar Logos. They are Those
who can discard or pass through the etheric body of the solar Logos and take
forms composed of either gaseous, liquid, or dense substance. The others
cannot. They cannot fall into physical generation.
Students must bear in mind that from the standpoint of the Logos, the solar
Angels on the mental plane (the fifth subplane of the cosmic physical plane)
are in physical incarnation, and what is called the “second fall” applies to this.
The first fall has reference to the taking of a form of cosmic etheric matter,
such as is the case with the Heavenly Men, the prototypes of the human jivas.
In this latter case the bodies used are called “formless” from our standpoint,
and are “vital bodies,” animated by cosmic prana. In the case of ourselves and
the remaining groups, the forms are composed of substance of the three lower
planes (that which the Logos does not regard as a principle) and, therefore,
matter responding still to the vibration of the earlier system. This means that
the four lower Hierarchies are links between the life of the past and of the
future. They are the present. They had not finished their contacts with the
active intelligent principle of the preceding kalpa, and so must continue such
contacts in this. They will work out of it in this system, the four will become
the three and they will then be the three higher arupa Hierarchies of the next
system. Before continuing our consideration of the particular Hierarchies, it is
necessary to point out that in these Hierarchies, certain of them are termed
“dominant hierarchies” and others “subsidiary hierarchies.” By this is meant
that certain of them are expressing themselves in this solar system more fully
than the others, and this necessarily entails [45] the consequence that their
vibration is more to be felt than that of the subsidiary groups. The dominant
groups are the second, fourth and fifth, and this because:
a. The second is the great expression of duality, of the Son as He vitalises
the Sun.
b. The fourth is the Hierarchy of human Monads who are the mediators or
the synthesisers; they express the gain of System 1 and the goal of
System 2.
c. The fifth or tenth is closely linked with the five liberated Hierarchies,
and is an expression of their synthesised life. It might, therefore, be said
that the fifth Hierarchy serves as the representative of the five liberated
groups, and the fourth is the representative group in this system, whilst
the second represents (for man, or these two groups united) that which
is the Spirit aspect, the Father, the Unknown.
Hierarchy V. The fifth Creative Hierarchy is, as we know from study of The
Secret Doctrine , a most mysterious one. This mystery is incident upon the
relation of the fifth Hierarchy to the five liberated groups . This relation, in
connection with our particular planet, which is not a sacred planet, can be
somewhat understood if the history of the Buddha, and His work is
contemplated. This is hinted at in the third volume of The Secret Doctrine .
The relation of the fifth Hierarchy to a certain constellation has also a bearing
upon this mystery. This is hidden in the karma of the solar Logos, and
concerns His relationship to another solar Logos, and the interplay of force
between Them in a great mahakalpa. This is the true “secret of the Dragon,”
and it was the dragon-influence or the “serpent energy” which caused the
influx of manasic or mind energy into the solar system. Entangled closely
[46] with the karma of these two cosmic Entities, was that of the lesser
cosmic Entity Who is the Life of our planet, the planetary Logos. It was this triple karma which brought in the “serpent religion” and the “Serpents or
Dragons of Wisdom,” in Lemurian days. It had to do with solar and planetary
Kundalini, or Serpent fire. A hint lies in the fact that the constellation of the
Dragon has the same relation to the ONE greater than our Logos as the centre
at the base of the spine has to a human being. It concerns stimulation, and
vitalisation with a consequent co-ordination of the manifesting fires.
A clue to the mystery lies also in the relation of this fifth group to the two
contracting poles. They are the five-fold Links, the “Benign Uniters” and “the
Producers of the Atonement.” Esoterically, they are the “Saviours of the
Race” and from Them emanates that principle which—in conjunction with the
highest aspect—lifts the lower aspect up to Heaven.
When these mysteries are carefully studied, and due application made to the
lives of the greatest exponents of the at-one-ing principle, it will become
apparent how great and all-important is their place in the scheme.
It is for this reason that the units of the fifth Hierarchy are called “The Hearts
of Fiery Love”; They save through love, and in Their turn these lives are
peculiarly close to the great Heart of Love of the solar Logos. These great
redeeming Angels, Who are the Sons of Men on their own true plane, the
mental, are ever, therefore, pictured as taking the form of twelve-petalled
lotuses—this symbology linking them up with “the Son of Divine Love,” the
manifested solar system, which is said to be a cosmic twelve-petalled lotus,
and with the logoic causal lotus, equally of a twelve-petalled nature.
[47] We have, therefore, a direct stream of energy flowing through:
a. The logoic twelve-petalled egoic lotus, cosmic mental plane.
b. The solar twelve-petalled lotus.
c. The planetary logoic heart, also a twelve-petalled lotus.
d. The twelve-petalled human egoic lotus on the mental plane.
e. The twelve-petalled heart centre in a human being.
Or, to word it otherwise, energy flows direct from:
a. The solar Logos, via three great cosmic centres: 1. The central spiritual Sun.
2. The heart of the Sun.
3. The physical Sun.
b. The heart centre of the planetary Logos, situated on the fourth cosmic
etheric plane (our buddhic plane).
c. The egoic lotus of a human being on the mental plane, which is literally
a correspondence to the “heart of the Sun.” The monadic point is a
reflection in the human system of the “central spiritual Sun.”
d. The heart centre of a man on the etheric plane of the physical plane,
which is in its turn a correspondence to the physical Sun.
Thus the tiny atom is linked with the great central Life of the solar system.
This fifth Hierarchy is equally, under the law, a distributor of energy to the
fifth subplane of each plane in the system, only it must be borne in mind that,
in the three worlds, it is the fifth subplane counting from above downwards,
whilst in the worlds of superhuman evolution, it is [48] the fifth counting
from below upwards. This Hierarchy wields, as we know, the dual aspects of
manas, one in the three worlds and one which makes itself felt in higher
spheres.
It is necessary to bear in mind that all these groups are (even when termed
“formless”) the true forms of all that persists, for all are in the etheric body of
the solar Logos or planetary Logos. This is a point requiring careful emphasis;
students have for too long regarded the form as being the dense physical body,
whereas to the occultist the physical body is not the form, but a gross maya,
or illusion, and the true form is the body of vitality. Therefore, these
Hierarchies are the sum total of the vital lives and the substratum or the
substance of all that is. We might regard the subject as follows:
a. The four superior groups are the Hierarchies expressing themselves
through the three cosmic ethers, the second, third and fourth.
b. The two lowest groups are the lives which are found functioning as the
involutionary matter (organised and unorganised) of the logoic dense physical body, the liquid and gaseous, with the living substance of the
four higher subplanes of the systemic dense physical body.
c. The fifth Hierarchy has an interesting position as the “mediating” body
between the higher four and those which are found on the lower three
subplanes. There is a vital and significant correspondence to be found
between the seven head centres and the seven groups of egos on the
mental plane, and there is an occult analogy between the three head
centres (pineal gland, pituitary body, and the alta major centre) and the
expression of these seven groups of egos in the three worlds. This is
[49] a most esoteric fact, and all students meditating upon the laws of
at-one-ment must take this analogy into consideration.
It is useful to remember the place of these Hierarchies in the scheme, and to
realise that upon the sum total of these vital bodies is gradually gathered the
dense manifestation which we regard as the evolutionary matter. The forms
are built (from the form of all atoms to the body of the ego, from the form of a
flower to the vast planetary or solar lotus) because the Hierarchies exist as the
aggregate of germ lives, giving the impulse, providing the model, and
procuring, through their very existence, the entire raison d’être of all that is
seen on all planes.
Hierarchies VI and VII. These sixth and seventh Hierarchies which provide
the substance forms of the three worlds have a vital use and a most interesting
place. From the logoic standpoint, they are not regarded as providing
principles, but from the standpoint of man they do provide him with His
lowest principles. They hold the same relation to the Logos as the dense
physical body does to man, and all that concerns the evolution of man must
(in this particular place) be studied as going on within the physical, logoic
vehicle. They deal with the display of physical energy; with the working out
in the physical vehicle of all divine purposes, and with the physical
organisation of a certain great cosmic Life.
Particularly is this so when we view the two Hierarchies under consideration.
They are the lowest residue of the previous system, and the energy of that
matter (liquid, gaseous and dense) which the vibration of the logoic permanent atom (on the plane adi) attracts to itself in the building of the
divine form. For purposes of clarification [50] and of generalisation, it might
be noted that the seventh Hierarchy is the life or energy found at the heart of
every atom, its positive aspect, and the sixth Hierarchy is the life of the forms
of all the etheric bodies of every tangible object. The function of this
Hierarchy is well described in the words of the Old Commentary:
“The devas hear the word go forth. They sacrifice themselves and out of
their own substance they build the form desired. They draw life and the
material from themselves, and yield themselves to the divine impulse.”
A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , pages 1196-1207
TABULATION III [51] Before continuing with the analysis of the tabulations and showing the
inter-relations existing in this particular zodiacal cycle between the twelve
signs of the zodiac and the twelve planets, there are certain things which I
would like to point out here in connection with these zodiacal constellations. They are in the nature of generalisations, but the specific and the particular
can be deduced from them.
First of all, I would point out that the twelve planets, governing the twelve
houses, concern primarily the physical plane expression of the man; they
affect potently the personality aspect; their influence, plus inherited karmic
conditions, produces those environing states and those circumstances which
give opportunity for the development and eventually the control of the form
side of life.
Secondly, the twelve constellations are concerned primarily with the
stimulation of the soul within the form, producing subjective activity which,
in its turn, causes changes in the outer expression, through the fusion of the
energy of the constellation with the energy of the planets. The effect produced
falls into two stages:
1. The first stage wherein the sun sign dominates the man and he is
gradually fitted to respond to the soul. His latent possibilities for this
life are unfolded. The effect of the sun sign is sometimes called “the
potency of the Sun of Probability.”
2. The second stage wherein there is increasing response to the energies,
concealed by the rising sign. They evoke the unexpected and produce
the hastening of the evolutionary process and the unfoldment of the
inner life. The rising sign is termed in the language of esotericism “the
Sun of Possibility.”
[52] Through the effect of the energy flowing from the zodiacal signs the man
is prepared for the “crisis of orientation” wherein he slowly and gradually
reverses his mode of progress upon the wheel of life and begins consciously
to travel back to his source. He then goes from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus,
Scorpio and Capricorn, instead of moving from Aries to Taurus via
Sagittarius, Leo and Cancer. The triplicity of constellations mentioned in
these two great routes around the zodiac have a definite and momentous effect
and are called “paramount signs of influence.” During this process the mental
principle, the discriminating mind, is developed and in this specific
connection (not in a general connection) the emphasis is laid upon the influence of Aries, Gemini and Libra. Under that influence the man learns to
overcome desire through experiment with and experience of every kind of
desire and selfish impulse. Thus gradually, and with infinite pain, the human
soul learns to function first as a member of the human family, and, secondly
as a spiritual entity, the divine soul.
You will see from the above that certain positions taken by the esoteric
astrologer reverse the position of the orthodox astrology of today. The reason
for this is that in the descent of ideas from the plane of ideas, they become
“reversed” upon the astral plane and subject to the great illusion; astrology
must eventually free itself from this reversal.
A right understanding of the effect of the various energies and forces will
make it apparent that, when the conditioning planetary forces, the expanding
energies of the sun sign and the driving energy of the rising sign are all being
controlled and directed by the illumined spiritual man, you will then have a
soul upon the very verge of liberation.
Eventually the energies of the twelve constellations [53] and—at a final stage
of experience and development—of the three great constellations which
condition the solar Logos are blended with the innate energies of the seven
rays or of the seven planetary Logoi. This marks a point of perfection. These
extraneous energies (I refer here to those of the major constellations) are
relayed to the Earth via the seven sacred planets and the five non-sacred
planets, and when there is the complete fusion of the related energies and,
therefore, full expression, a great world period comes to an end. For a long
time during this cycle of reincarnations and periods of manifestation, the
human being is conditioned almost entirely by the activity of the non-sacred
planets. These, as you know, are five in number:
The Sun (veiling a planet)
The Moon (veiling a planet)
The Earth itself
Mars
Pluto Man—speaking symbolically—is the “five-pointed star and, at the fiery
points, the forces of the man pour out and upon each fiery point appears a
centre of reception.” This is of course pictorially expressed, but the meaning
is clear. However, as man nears the Path of Discipleship the influence of the
sacred planets becomes increasingly effective, until after the final and fifth
initiation the non-sacred planets have no effect, though the initiate wields
their energies potently as they pour into and through his vehicles of reception,
of response and of expression, for all three activities and purposes must be
noted.
The energies of the twelve constellations are blended with those of the twelve
planets, but their power to evoke response, and to be consciously received,
recognised and [54] employed, is dependent entirely upon the type of
response mechanism of the planetary Life and of the individual man. It has
been rightly said that consciousness is dependent upon the vehicles of
consciousness, upon their point of development and upon the ability of the
individual to identify himself with the energies and impulses which are
reaching him, and is not dependent only upon that which is already a
recognised part or aspect of himself. It might be said that the higher response
to the realities and qualities revealed and made possible by the impact of
energy from the zodiacal signs is somewhat dependent upon the waning
influence of the planets to hold down the consciousness aspect of the man.
Ponder upon this, for it embodies a deep esoteric truth.
Thus, two potent streams of energy—cosmic and systemic—reach man via
the conditioning planetary centres of force (the seven planetary schemes in
the solar system and their corresponding seven centres in the planet on which
we live) and pour into the symbolic “twelve houses” through their medium. It
is for this reason that our solar system is spoken of as one of “intrinsic
duality” (love-wisdom) and that the major task of man is the “regulation of
the pairs of opposites.” The theme of duality, therefore, runs through the
whole story of man’s development. Upon all the three planes of human
unfoldment the reconciliation goes forward.
1. Upon the physical plane we find the merging of the dense and the
etheric forces. This is consummated upon the Path of Purification . 2. Upon the astral plane there must come the resolution of the pairs of
opposites. This is consummated upon the Path of Discipleship . [55]
3. Upon the mental plane the Angel of the Presence and the Dweller on the
Threshold are brought face to face. Their synthesis is brought about
upon the Path of Initiation .
What is true of man in this connection is true also of humanity as a whole, of
the planetary Logos of the Earth, as of all planetary Logoi, and of a solar
Logos. The analogy between the fusion of the pairs of opposites, for instance,
upon the physical plane can be seen in the conscious and directed fusion of
the planetary forces with the energy of any specific planet or group of planets.
The analogy, involving discrimination to regulate and offset the force of the
pairs of opposites upon the astral plane, can be seen when the energies of the
sun sign and of the planets are perfectly directed and adjusted. The analogy
can also be carried forward onto the mental plane and when the energies of
the sun sign and the rising sign are coherently blended and expressed (in the
case of both the individual or a planetary Life) there comes a point of crisis
wherein the soul and the personality are brought face to face. The Angel of
the Presence, distributing solar fire and holding focussed electric fire, and the
Dweller on the Threshold, expressing and utilising fire by friction, know each
other “with intimate occult knowledge.” The door then stands open wide
through which the life and light of the three major constellations can—after
the third initiation—be occultly available to the initiate, be he a liberated
human being or a planetary Logos.
When astrologers understand the true significance of the constellation
Gemini, the Twins, and the dual forces which pour through this sign (the
“forces in conflict” as they are sometimes called or “the quarrelling brothers”)
[56] and beat upon our planetary life, then the true method of resolving the
dualities will be known.
It is interesting to note also that seven of the symbols which express the
twelve signs of the zodiac are dual in their nature, and duality can be inferred
from them.
1. The two horns of the Ram in Aries. 2. The two horns of the Bull in Taurus.
3. The figures of the Twins in Gemini (two lines). Júpiter . The two claws of the Crab in Cancer.
5. The two scales of the Balance in Libra.
6. The two Parallel Lines of force in Aquarius.
7. The two Fishes in Pisces.
These seven constellations are, therefore, closely related to six of the seven
sacred planets and to one non-sacred planet. There are two signs which are
simple figures and have no significance of duality. They are
8. The symbol for Leo, which is simply the Lion’s tail. Mercúrio . The arrow in the symbol depicting Sagittarius.
They embody the idea of isolated separation and one-pointed desire. Two
signs are definitely triple in construction and this has a clear meaning to the
esotericist.
10. Virgo is a triple sign.
11. Scorpio is also a triple sign, closely resembling the symbol of Virgo.
These two signs are crucial in the experience of the human being, indicating
as they do the function of the triple form and the liberation of the man
imprisoned in the form, through the tests in Scorpio wherein he proves to
himself and to the world the reality of that which Virgo has veiled or hidden.
[57]
12. The symbol for the sign Capricorn is most mysterious. It conceals the
mystery of the Crocodiles, or Makara. It is constructed in an inaccurate
and definitely misleading manner and should be regarded as a mystery
and therefore not to be defined.
These signs and their relationship to the sacred and non-sacred planets will be
considered later.
To sum up: Man will, therefore, have to be studied as a threefold entity, a
composite individual, expressing (in the three worlds):
a. The spiritual soul, reflecting the Monad. b. The human soul, reflecting the divine soul.
c. The form nature, which should be the revealer of the two higher.
Three Creative Hierarchies condition the man in incarnation, the 4th (or 9th)
the 5th (or 10th) and the 6th. These, in collaboration, create man and, at the
same time, constitute the field of his expression. Man is consequently a blend
of electric fire, being a divine Flame, and becomes eventually responsive to
the three major controlling influences; he is also solar fire, being a solar
Angel in manifestation. He then becomes increasingly responsive to the
influences of the twelve constellations. He is likewise fire by friction and
comes under the influence of the planets. The tabulation below may make this
somewhat clearer:
I. Electric Fire .—Path of Initiation—4th Hierarchy; full soul expression;
monadic life.
GOAL: Identification with the Monad. Produces responsiveness to
the three constellations. Gêmeos . Solar Fire .—Path of Discipleship—5th Hierarchy; full life experience;
soul life. [58]
GOAL: Identification with the Soul . Produces responsiveness to the
twelve zodiacal constellations.
III. Fire by Friction .—Path of Evolution—6th Hierarchy; life experiment;
human life.
GOAL: Identification with the Personality . Produces responsiveness
to the planetary influences. 3. The Great Wheel and Spiritual Unfoldment.
Before I give you the remaining part of the chart which deals with the
constellations as conductors of cosmic energies or as transmitters of their own
energy, I would like to remark that much that I shall say will be based upon:
1. The wheel of life and the path of man, the human being, as he passes
through the signs according to the mode recognised by orthodox
astrology. He, as well as the planets, apparently retrogrades through the signs and appears to pass through the constellations from Aries to
Taurus. But this is all part of the Great Illusion.
2. The wheel of life and the path of man, the divine or spiritual soul, as he
passes through the signs of the zodiac according to the mode studied by
the esoteric astrologer. This is the Path of Reality as the other is the
Path of Illusion. This carries the disciple around the path from
commencement in Aries to consummation in Pisces.
The present method is based upon the temporary truth that ordinary man is
subject to the illusory nature of manifestation and “as he thinks, so is he.”
When, however, he becomes Hercules, the Sun God (or solar Angel), he
begins to reverse the process (again only apparently) and a definite
reorientation takes place. The Teachers on the [59] inner side, therefore, study
the horoscope only in its relation to the following three entities:
1. The horoscope of the planet itself as the expression of the life of the
planetary Logos. This involves the studying of the horoscope of the
spirit of the planet as well as of the informing Life and their joint
relationship and interplay. The spirit of the Earth is to the planetary
Logos of the Earth, for instance, what the personality (or form nature) is
to the soul of man. The two horoscopes are superimposed and the
“planetary pattern” then emerges.
2. The horoscope of the human family , of the fourth kingdom in nature,
regarding it as an entity, which it essentially is. This is in reality the
study of two horoscopes, as in the above case; the horoscope of the
kingdom of souls, of the divine sons of God upon the mental plane, and
the study of the entity which is the coherent life of the form side of the
fourth kingdom in nature. This is again done by superimposing the two
charts. These charts are drawn on a large scale and on a transparent
material of which humanity knows nothing. Upon these charts are noted
the pattern which emerges when “soul and personality are brought
together” and present conditions, possible developments and
relationships, and the immediate future objective appear with clarity. 3. The horoscopes of disciples . The Masters do not study the charts of
ordinary undeveloped man. There is no profit in so doing. This involves
again the study of the two horoscopes of the disciple under inspection
—one of the soul and the other of the personality. Again the process of
superimposition is utilised. In one horoscope, [60] the new orientation
and the embryonic reorganised inner life will be noted and studied, and
in the other the outer life and its conformity or non-conformity to inner
conditions will be the subject of attention. Thus the life pattern will
emerge, possibilities will be indicated, problems will disappear, and the
immediate next step will clearly show forth.
It thus becomes apparent again to what an extent the “principle of duality”
enters into everything. It is a shifting dualism, according to where the
emphasis may be placed, but this dualism is present until the last and final
initiation—present in the later stages of the evolutionary process, in the
adjustment of form relations but not present in the consciousness of the
disciple of advanced degree. That is the major point to be grasped.
A third point must here be made, following upon the two earlier emphasised.
A great part of our study will be occupied with the relation of the six
constellations in the upper half of the zodiacal wheel to the six which are
found in the lower half; we shall consider the energy which is a human being
(note that phrasing) as it travels anti-clockwise from Aries to Taurus and then
—reversing the process—travels from Aries to Pisces. We will consider the
dualities provided by one of these constellations and its opposite; we will
study, therefore, the great qualities provided by a constellation and its
opposite sign. We will take up these points in the following manner:
1. From the standpoint of commencement in Aries until the man—through
many turnings of the wheel of life—reaches the point of reversal and
reorientation. The man progresses from the point where, in Cancer , he
forms a part of the mass with the mass consciousness, [61] inchoate
and unfocussed, and with no recognition of objective (except the
satisfaction of instinctual desire) until in Scorpio he becomes the
triumphant disciple, having found himself in Leo . Then comes the Crisis of Reorientation which may take a long time and constitute an
interlude of many lives of struggle.
2. From the standpoint of the man upon the probationary path, seeking the
light, struggling through the signs (as the Old Commentary expresses it
when considering this point):
“He turns from right to left, and then again from left to right. He revolves
in giddy fashion upon an axis of desire. He knows not where to go or what
to do. The sky turns black.”
At this point, the sign Gemini begins potently to play its part in the life of
the disciples, with Sagittarius gradually “piercing the heart with his
arrows, and then upon the flight of the arrow, the man reaches
Capricorn.” Then comes the Crisis of Renunciation.
3. From the standpoint of the pledged disciple and initiate who traverses
again the Path of the Sun and finds that that which he has discovered
himself to be in Leo finds its crown in Aquarius . The separative
individual consciousness becomes the group consciousness in Aquarius,
and he begins to comprehend the significance of that basic combination
of signs, that “triangle in the consciousness” of humanity:
Cancer . . . . . . . . . .
Mass awareness . . .
Instinctual
consciousness . . . . Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Individual awareness . . . . Aquarius.
Group awareness. Intelligent consciousness . Intuitive consciousness. [62] Then, from the standpoint of achievement in Capricorn , he works for
several lives around the zodiacal path, descending into the sea of the mass
consciousness to become what is called in the ancient books “the Crab, who
clears the ocean of matter which flows around the soul of man,” and
eventually to become a functioning world saviour in Pisces . He descends into
the world of men to save mankind and to further the plan. He is then “the fish
who swims free in the ocean of matter.”
The initiate has always to express, in each sign of the zodiac, the
consummation and the spiritual fruit of earlier life experience, world experiment and soul achievement. Selfishness has ever to be translated into
living active service, and desire has to demonstrate its transmutation in the
purity of spiritual aspiration for identification with the will of God.
There are one or two points which must be dealt with in order to enable you to
study with certain definite ideas clearly formulated in your minds. I have
hinted at them in some of my earlier books but it will be of service to refer to
them again and to expand the ideas somewhat. I would have you carry them
in your minds as you read and study.
I have frequently referred to the fact that the entire science of astrology is
based upon a non-existent condition. It has no basis in material fact and yet is
eternally based on truth. The zodiac is, as you well know, the imaginary path
of the Sun in the heavens. It is therefore largely an illusion, from the exoteric
point of view. But at the same time the constellations exist, and the streams of
energy which pass and repass, intermingle and interlock throughout the body
of space are by no means illusions but definitely express eternal relationships.
It is the misuse of the [63] various energies which has created the illusion.
This illusory path is consequently as much a reality to humanity today as are
the personality illusions of any individual. These illusions are due to the
polarisation of the individual upon the astral plane.
It is interesting also to note in this connection that—due to the precession of
the equinoxes—a fourth type of force is brought to bear upon the planet and
man, but one which is seldom recognised and given due place in the
horoscope. The month and the sign, or the place of the Sun in the heavens, do
not really coincide. When we state, for instance, that the Sun is “in Aries” it
conveys an esoteric truth but not an exoteric fact. The Sun was in Aries at the
beginning of this great cycle, but it is not in exactly the same position today
when it is “found” in that sign.
Also it should be remembered that as it is necessary to know the moment of
birth and the place of birth in casting the horoscope of the individual, so in
order to have a perfectly correct understanding and accurate deductions in
connection with the constellation, the planets and our Earth there should be a
fixed time from which to reckon. That fixed time is as yet unknown in exoteric astrology, though the Hierarchy possesses the needed information
and it will be made available when the right time comes. It is the knowledge
of this inner information which constitutes the basis of the statements which I
have made or will make which will seem revolutionary to the orthodox
investigator. There has to be a constant rectification of the earlier conclusions
of humanity and of this the outstanding instance is the statement in the Bible
that the prime date of creation is 4004 B.C. This is recognised as an error by
modern science but is still believed by many.
I earlier gave a hint upon which definite astrological [64] computation could
be based when I gave the time of the “Great Approach” of the Hierarchy to
our planetary manifestation when individualisation took place and the fourth
kingdom in nature appeared. I placed that stupendous event as happening
21,688,345 years ago. At that time the Sun was in Leo . The process then
initiated upon the physical plane and producing outer physical events took
approximately 5,000 years to mature and the Sun was in Gemini when the
final crisis of individualisation took place and the door was then closed upon
the animal kingdom.
It has been stated that Sagittarius governs human evolution, as the Sun was in
that sign when the Hierarchy began its Approach in order to stimulate the
forms of life upon our planet. Sagittarius, however, governed the period of the
subjective approach.
The Sun was in Leo when physical plane individualisation took place as a
result of the applied stimulation.
The Sun was in Gemini when this Approach was consummated by the
founding of the Hierarchy upon the Earth. This is one of the great secrets
which the Masonic Rituals typify, for the symbol of the sign, Gemini, is the
source of the concept of the two pillars, so familiar to Masons. It might
therefore be stated that, symbolically speaking,
1. Leo governs the E .·. A .·. degree.
2. Gemini governs the F.·. C.·. degree.
3. Sagittarius governs the degree of M.·.M.·. up to the episode of the
raising of the Master, and that Capricorn governs the final part of the ceremony and the H.·. R.·. A.·.
It is always confusing to the beginner who has not yet a developed and trained
intuition to reconcile the seeming discrepancies and apparent contradictions
which appear in [65] the teaching of the Ageless Wisdom. This same
difficulty will be met with in the science of astrology and some reference to
the matter is in order at this point. I would remind you of the occult truism
which states that interpretation and right understanding are based upon the
stage of the development of the individual. H. Plutão .B. remarked in The Secret
Doctrine that for some people the highest principle of which they can be
consciously aware might be a very low one for another person. The
constellations and the planets which govern them may, and do, have one
effect upon the mass and another upon the average individual man, and still a
third effect upon the disciple or the initiate. As the various energies and forces
circulate throughout the etheric body of our solar system, their reception and
effect will depend upon the state of the planetary centres and upon the point
of unfoldment of the centres in individual man. That is why the various charts
and tabulations can differ so widely and different planets can appear as ruling
the constellations. There seems to be no fixed rule and the student gets
bewildered. Orthodox astrology posits one set of planetary rulers, and they are
correct as far as the mass of humanity is concerned. But the disciple, who
lives above the diaphragm, responds to another combination and it is with
these that I shall principally deal. That is why the three charts here given do
not appear to coincide. They are drawn up to express the situation in regard to
three groups:
1. The mass of people who conform to orthodox and recognised
astrological conclusions.
2. Disciples and advanced individuals, conforming to the conclusions of
esoteric astrology.
3. The Creative Hierarchies, giving the interim situation in this world
cycle. [66]

NOTE: In connection with disciples and the zodiacal signs, Gemini and Libra are two constellations
which—through their rulers—express 5th and 7th ray energy. For some occult reason, they remain unrelated to any other of the signs. [67] The relation between the other constellations through the planets, as
expressing the rays, is as follows:

In view of all the above, and starting with the basic fact of the Great Illusion it
should be remembered that the [69] accuracy of astrological prediction and
interpretation will be based upon three factors: 1. The potency of the thoughtforms which have been built up in
connection with the twelve signs. These thoughtforms were originally
constructed or anchored upon the mental plane by the Hierarchy in
Atlantean days and they have steadily gained in power ever since. They
serve as focal points for certain forces and enable the individual, for
instance, to be in touch with great reservoirs of energy which then
definitely condition him.
2. The intuition of the astrologer. The casting of the horoscope serves to
put the astrologer en rapport with the individual, but this is of small
service to either party unless the intuition and sensitivity of the
astrologer is actively present.
3. The capacity of the astrologer in any specific period to respond to the
changes which are all the time taking place, such as the gradual shifting
and changing brought about by the precession of the equinoxes, or the
slow shift of the pole of the planet. To this should be added that—as
man evolves—the mechanism of response or the vehicles of
consciousness likewise steadily improve. His reactions, therefore, to the
planetary influence and to the energy of the various constellations
change with equal steadiness and allowance must be made for this. It is
consequently essential that the modern astrologer begin to study the
point in evolution of the subject, prior to casting his horoscope. He
must ascertain his approximate place upon the path of evolution. To this
end, the study of the rays is most necessary through an investigation as
to quality and characteristics and life objectives.
[70] Astrologers will eventually be able to cast the horoscope of the soul,
which is sensitive to different combinations of forces to those controlling the
personality life. The disciple and the initiate respond distinctively to the
incoming influences and their response differs from that of the undeveloped
man or the self-centred person. This will have to be recognised. Those who
“live below the diaphragm” and who react to the incoming energies through
the medium of the lower centres will have a very different type of chart to that
of the disciple and initiate. It will require a different mode of interpretation. I have referred to this before and would remind you of some of the points
which I made.
1. Disciples upon the Path of Discipleship are strongly influenced by
Mercury and Saturn —one bringing illumination and the other offering
opportunity.
2. At the various initiations, the influence of the planets affects the
candidate in a totally different manner than earlier. Cyclically the
energies from the constellations pour through the planetary centres.
a. At the first initiation, the disciple has to contend with the crystallising
and destroying forces of Vulcan and Pluto. The influence of Vulcan
reaches to the very depths of his nature, whilst Pluto drags to the
surface and destroys all that hinders in these lower regions.
b. At the second initiation, the candidate comes under the influence of
three planets—Neptune, Venus and Jupiter . The three centres—solar
plexus, heart and throat—are actively involved.
c. At the third initiation, the Moon (veiling a hidden planet) and Mars
bring about a fearful conflict, [71] but at the end the man is released
from personality control.
d. At the fourth initiation, Mercury and Saturn again bring about great
changes and unique revelation, but their effect is very different to the
earlier experience.
e. At the fifth and final initiation, Uranus and Jupiter appear and
produce a “beneficent organisation” of the totality of energies found
in the initiate’s equipment. When this reorganisation is complete, the
initiate can then “escape from off the wheel and then can truly live.”
All this time the energy of the sun (veiling a sacred planet, hitherto unknown)
is steadily and persistently reaching the man via the solar angel. CHAPTER Gêmeos - The Nature of Esoteric
Astrology
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
[75] It will be apparent to you after studying the foregoing that one of the
results which should emerge under the impression of this new approach to
astrological diagnosis (as far as the individual is concerned) will be the
more correct casting of the horoscope of advanced human beings—disciples
and initiates. This has not hitherto been accurately possible. It will only
come about, however, if there is wise and right experiment and
investigation.
I have posited two sets of rulers for two types of people:
1. The orthodox and generally accepted series of planetary rulers for the
undeveloped and average man.
2. A new combination of rulers and constellations for those upon the
Path.
It will be necessary to remember nevertheless that there are an infinite
number of permutations possible, of complexities and relationships, due to
the vast number of possible combinations existing in the path of life of the
individual and dependent upon his stage of evolutionary unfoldment. These
might be divided into three groups through a broad, but necessarily
inadequate, generalisation: [76]
1. Average and undeveloped man, living below the diaphragm and with
the emphasis of the incoming energies and forces focussed either in
the solar plexus or in the sacral centre.
2. A large number of people who are in an interim stage, with the
energies and forces focussed mainly in the lower centre but at the
same time playing quite frequently through the throat centre and
evoking a faint response from the heart and the ajna centres. 3. People upon one or other of the final stages of the Path, with the
emphasis passing rapidly away from the lower centres into the higher
triad and with the highest head centre in process of awakening. These
people also fall into two major groups:
a. Those who are using the solar plexus centre as a vast clearing house
for the incoming energies and who are beginning to work through
the throat and the heart centres, with the goal of completely
awakening the ajna centre.
b. Those who are using all these centres, but in whom the heart centre
is fully awakened and the triangle of force in the head (from the
ajna centre to the head centre and from the head centre to the centre
found in the medulla oblongata) is beginning to function.
When these centres are all awakening, their simplest combinations are the
following triangles. The Science of Triangles underlies all astrological
deduction as well as the centres in the human body. This you know, but the
four triplicities of orthodox astrology are only the rudiments of this true
science, which lies behind the orthodox interpretations. [77]

tabulation would make it appear, for the emphasis, the focus and the mode
of arranging and of vitalisation, and the appearance of these esoteric
triangles vary with the ray type. This Science of Triangles of Energy
underlies the new esoteric science both in astrology and in the science of
laya-yoga or the science of the centres. Both this ancient yoga and the still
more ancient astrological science have now to be studied upon a higher turn of the spiral. Up till the present time, the teaching about the centres has been
inherited from Atlantean times and couched in the old forms and formulas
which are basically unsuited to our present greatly advanced stage of
development. The same can be said of orthodox or exoteric astrology. Both
these sciences must be reoriented and rearranged, and astrology must be
based upon a deeper understanding of the relation of the planets—sacred
and non-sacred—to the centres and to certain prominent “cycles of
polarisation” emerging as the fore-ordained results of “periods of crisis.”
This last sentence embodies a basic and important statement of truth. [78] 1. Centres and Triangles of Force
There are, as you well know, five non-sacred planets, and seven which are
regarded as sacred. These twelve planetary lives (with their own cycles,
points of crisis and moments of polarisation) are closely related to the seven
centres. The five centres up the spine are related to the five non-sacred
planets, but in unevolved or average man, are focussed almost entirely upon
the astral plane and in the astral body. It should be noted that:
1. Two of the non-sacred planets (the Earth itself and the Moon) are
connected with two centres which in the highly evolved man are not
of dominating importance:
a. The spleen receiving pranic emanations from the planet on which
we live and concerned with the etheric and physical bodies and
their physical relation.
b. A centre in the chest related to the thymus gland. This centre
becomes inactive in the advanced man but has a connection with
the vagus nerve, prior to the awakening of the heart centre.
2. Two of the other non-sacred planets—Mars and Pluto—function in
connection with the sacral centre (Mars) and the solar plexus (Pluto).
This latter planet becomes active in the life of the man who is
“becoming alive in the higher sense, his lower nature passes into the
smoke and darkness of Pluto, who governs the lesser burning ground,
in order that the man may live in truth in the higher land of light.” 3. The Sun (standing here for Vulcan, which is a sacred planet) governs a
centre in the front of the throat which is related to the para-thyroids
and not to the thyroid [79] gland, which is related to the throat centre.
This centre in the front of the throat falls into disuse as the creative
period of throat activity begins. It acts as a “mediator” between the
higher and the lower creative organs (between the sacral and the
throat centres) and leads eventually to that creative activity which is
consciously that of the functioning soul. Vulcan was one of the first
creative workers among men. He was also related to “Cain who killed
his brother.” The symbolism underlying these ancient myths will be
easily interpreted by the intuitive student.
Some of the tasks which I propose to undertake in this section of our
Treatise on the Seven Rays are as follows:
1. Consider why five of the seven rays express themselves through two
sets of planets—sacred and non-sacred—and also which centres these
two groups of rays govern. Thus we shall relate:
a. The seven centres in man's etheric body.
b. The seven centres of the fourth Creative Hierarchy of which the
seven races are the expression.
c. The seven planetary centres.
d. The seven and the five planets which are the centres of energy in
the solar system, responsive to the energy of the twelve zodiacal
constellations.
These planetary centres will be studied from two angles:
a. From the orthodox angle.
b. From the angle of discipleship and initiation.
2. Consider the energies of the three major constellations as they each
pour through three of the zodiacal constellations, thus forming great
interlocking triangles of [80] force. Thus nine of the zodiacal
constellations are involved, and these in their turn fuse and blend their energies into three major streams of force upon the Path of Initiation.
These three streams of force pour through:
a. Leo, Capricorn and Pisces.
to
b. Saturn, Mercury and Uranus (the Moon).
to
c. The head, ajna and heart centres.
to
d. The throat, the solar plexus and the base of the spine.
It should be remembered that the sacral centre and the spleen are
primarily connected with the planetary emanation of the Earth itself.

sweep of the soul in incarnation. Júpiter . Elaborate the subject of the interplay between the three groups of ruling
planets as given in Tabulation VI. These, in the totality of their effects, are
the agencies through which the purposes of God are wrought out.
[81] Before proceeding with the more technical aspects of our subject, I
would like to elaborate this theme of the zodiac, its story and symbolism
from the more philosophical and spiritual angle, giving you the subjective
picture of man's progress as he passes on “the sweep of the sun along the
path of life.” This is a technical phrase and refers to the activity of a sun, a planet, a hierarchy or a man, after there has been a “moment of crisis,”
resulting in a “period of polarisation,” leading inevitably to a fresh surge
and sweep onwards. These three words—crisis, polarisation and sweep—are
the basis of cyclic law and govern the evolutionary process. From the point
of view of humanity, the passage of the Sun around the zodiac is apparently
a slow and laborious process, taking approximately (on the plane of time)
25,000 years. From the angle of the inner vision, it is a sweep around the
Path of Life, taking only a moment of time and “obliterating past, present
and future in the radiant glory of the work accomplished.” 2. The Crosses and the Signs
We will follow man from sign to sign as he—in travail and pain—forges the
equipment and develops painfully the mechanism which will enable him to
arrive at a major moment of crisis in his cyclic life wherein he will begin to
free himself from the path of the great illusion along which he has travelled
for aeons from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces and—reversing himself—will
begin to travel the path of light from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. This
changing experience is expressed for us most beautifully in the sixth section
of the Old Commentary :
“The Cross of many changes (the Mutable Cross. A.A.B.) continues
with its whirling, carrying [82] crucified thereon the form of a man in
whom is found the seed of all illusion.
But, from the Cross whereon he has been slain—e'en though he knew it
not—the man climbs down and feels his way (with pain and many tears)
on to another Cross—a Cross of blinding light, of fiery pain, of bitter
woe, and yet the Cross of liberation. It is a stationary Cross, fixed in the
Heavens, and guarded by the Angel.
Behind the Cross, another Cross appears, but that he may not reach (the
Angel guards the way!) until the Bull has rent and torn the man, and then
—the light shines forth; until the Serpent dread has wrestled with the man
and brought him to his knees, and then—the lifting up into the light; until
the Lion has been tamed, the secret of the Sphinx revealed, and then—the revelation of the inner light; until the man has lifted up his water-pot and
joined the ranks of those who are the Water-bearers, and then the flowing
of the stream of life will fill his water-pot and drain the rancid pool and
cleanse its source and thus reveal the hidden way which leads unto the
innermost light, hid by the final Cross. Then, from the Cross of man, the
initiate finds his way, passes the Angel and leaves behind the inner torn
veil, mounts the major Cross and passes into day, the final day . The
wheel for him stands still. The sun and stars, for him, fade out. A great
light is seen and...”
The three crosses on Mount Golgotha were Biblical symbols of these three
astrological crosses, the Common or Mutable Cross, the Fixed Cross and the
Cardinal Cross.
[83] I would ask you to remember that though I shall trace the progress of
the man from sign to sign around the zodiacal way, yet there is not
necessarily this ordered sequence of travel or the smooth passage from sign
to sign as I may portray it. All souls come into incarnation in the sign
Cancer. By this I mean that the very first human incarnation was always
taken in this sign which has been recognised down the ages as “the doorway
into life of those who must know death,” just as the constellation Capricorn
is ever regarded as another door and is called esoterically the “doorway into
life of those who know not death.” As the ages slip away, the man passes
into and out of all the signs, the particular sign being determined by the
nature of the personality ray which itself changes, as you know, from life to
life. In those signs he learns the needed lessons, broadens his horizon,
integrates his personality, begins to sense the conditioning soul, and thus
discovers his essential duality. When he is upon the Path of Discipleship
(and here I include the Path of Initiation) occult rumour says that he then
becomes conditioned by the tireless Watcher, the soul, and is subjected
(during the final stages of the path) to exactly twelve incarnations, passing
one in each of the twelve signs. In them he has to prove himself, attaining
great moments of crisis in each of the constellations of the Fixed Cross in
particular. From point to point, stage to stage, and finally Cross to Cross, he fights for his spiritual life, in all the twelve houses and all the twelve
constellations, subjected to countless combinations of forces and energies—
ray, planetary, zodiacal and cosmic—until he is “made anew,” becomes the
“new man,” is sensitive to the entire range of spiritual vibrations in our solar
system and has achieved that detachment which will enable him to escape
from the wheel of rebirth. He has accomplished [84] this by mounting the
three Crosses—the cross of the Personality or the changing form, the Cross
of the Disciple or the eternal soul, and the Cross of the Spirit. This really
means that he has passed through three momentous crises in his life cycle.

In our study of the interlocking system of energies, in so far as they affect
and condition a human being, the theme of the Three Crosses is of profound
and practical interest, especially as they provide those points of crisis
wherein a man steps off the ordinary path of evolution and treads the path of
discipleship or—after the third initiation mounts a third Cross. It will
underlie our thought and all that I have to say. A steady recollection of the
twelve basic energies [85] (five major and seven minor which are in reality,
and apart from astral reversion due to the Great Illusion, seven major and
five minor) will be of value. These work out into human expression via the
Lords of the twelve signs and the twelve planetary Rulers. These twelve
basic energies emanate from the seven stars of the Great Bear (transmitted through seven stars of the Little Bear); two of them come from Sirius and
three from the Pleiades. This set-up (if I may use such an unorthodox term)
will be the condition of the major solar sphere of influence at the end of the
Great Age of Brahma, as it is esoterically called. In the “interim or interlude
of evolution” (which is the inadequate translation of an occult phrase given
to a world cycle in the Masters' Archives) these energies are stepped down
into forces and are literally sixteen all told—from the angle of
manifestation, I would remind you—and make literally: 7+7+2=16=7. In
these numbers the mystery of our evolutionary process lies hid. Always,
however, the emphasis must be laid upon the Rays of Energy and Quality as
they pour through the zodiacal constellations and the planets. The new
astrology therefore is necessarily based upon an understanding of the rays.
The following tabulation is fundamental in its implications in this
connection and upon it all that I have to say will be based.
Seven stars of the Great Bear are the originating Sources of the seven rays
of our solar system. The seven Rishis (as They are called) of the Great Bear
express Themselves through the medium of the seven planetary Logoi Who
are Their Representatives and to Whom They stand in the relation of
prototype. The seven Planetary Spirits manifest through the medium of the
seven sacred planets.
Each of these seven Rays, coming from the Great [86] Bear, are transmitted
into our solar system through the medium of three constellations and their
ruling planets. The following tabulation makes this clear but must be
interpreted only in terms of this present turn of the Great Zodiacal Wheel
(25,000 years):

readjustment of ideas will be needed as the new astrology is worked out into
practical usefulness and eventually substituted for that now holding sway.
This new astrology really embodies five sciences: [87]
1. The Science of the Rays.
2. The Science of Esoteric Interpretation which is carried out through
3. The Science of Triangles. Júpiter . The Science of the Centres.
5. The Science of Destiny.
This latter science will be based upon the four previous ones and will
constitute an interpretation of the future which will be founded on a correct
understanding of the rays—personal and egoic—of the influence of the
triangles—zodiacal, planetary, racial and human. These latter triangles are
arrived at by a study of the individual human centres. When all this has been
ascertained and worked out in the new style of horoscope which will be later
developed, then the Science of Destiny will be applied and the future
indications discovered. Of this, the personal progressed horoscope is the
embryonic seed. Some indication of relative values can be gained by a consideration of the
human triangles as given in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , which suggested the
following:
“It would repay the student to contemplate the interesting succession of
triangles that are to be found and the way in which they must be linked by
the progression of the fire before that fire can perfectly vivify them, and
thence pass on to other transmutations. We might enumerate some of
these triangles, bearing always in mind that, according to the ray, so will
proceed the geometric rising of the fire, and according to the ray, so will
the points be touched in ordered sequence. Herein lies one of the secrets
of initiation, and herein are found some of the dangers entailed in a too
quick publication of information concerning the rays. [88]
1. The pranic triangle.
a. The shoulder centre.
b. The centre near the diaphragm.
c. The spleen.
2. Man controlled from the astral plane.
a. The base of spine.
b. The solar plexus.
c. The heart.
3. Man controlled from the mental plane.
a. The base of spine.
b. The heart.
c. The throat. Júpiter . Man partially controlled by the Ego, advanced man.
a. The heart.
b. The throat.
c. The head, i.e., the four lesser centres and their synthesis, the ajna
centre. 5. Spiritual man to the third Initiation.
a. The heart.
b. The throat.
c. The seven head centres.
6. Spiritual man to the fifth Initiation.
a. The heart.
b. The seven head centres.
c. The two many-petalled lotuses.
All these different periods show different triangular radiations. We
must not infer from this that when the fire is centred in one triangle it is
not demonstrating in others. Once the fire has free passage along any
triangle it flames continuously, but always there is one triangle more
radiant and luminous than the others, and it is from these glowing
triangles of light, issuing from wheels and vortices of fire, [89] that the
clairvoyant and the teachers of the race can appraise a man's position in
the scheme of things, and judge of his attainment. At the culmination of
life experience, and when man has reached his goal, each triangle is a
radiant path of fire, and each centre a wheel of living fiery force rotating
at terrific speed; the centre at this stage not only rotates in a specific
direction, but literally turns upon itself, forming a living flaming
iridescent globe of pure fire, and holding within it a certain geometrical
shape, yet withal vibrating so rapidly that the eye can scarcely follow it.
Above all, at the top of the head will be seen a fiery display that seems to
put all the other centres into insignificance; from the heart of this manypetalled lotus issues a flame of fire with the basic hue of a man's ray. This
flame mounts upward and seems to attract downward a sheet of electric
light, which is the downflow from the spirit on the highest plane. This
marks the blending of the fires and the deliverance of man from the
trammels of matter.”
A Treatise on Cosmic Fire (pp. 169-171) At present, charts are set up on the basis of the personality condition or of
the personality ray, if the astrologer is fortunate enough to know or to guess
it accurately; if, however, the subject is an advanced person, then the chart
will be frequently wrong as the planets which govern in the case of ordinary
or undeveloped man have ceased to influence the spiritual man and the
disciple. Average man is primarily conditioned in the events of his physical
plane life by the position of the planets in the twelve houses and they are, in
their turn, conditioned by certain karmic influences which the advanced man
has overcome, or is overcoming. The horoscope will be cast eventually on
the basis of the soul ray, and then the zodiacal signs which govern the
activities and [90] the influence of the present group of planetary Rulers
will be considerably lessened. New planetary potencies (conveying zodiacal
energies) will control and take precedence of the old ones, thus putting the
man in touch with different forces. Finally the time will come when he will
be sensitive to the whole range of vibrations; charts will then be set up
which will be called “charts of the crosses” and not simply indications of
planetary influences in the twelve houses. I question whether there is any
living astrologer capable of doing this as yet. These are the kind of charts by
which the Masters gauge Their disciples and they are most interesting; I
touched upon them somewhat earlier in this treatise. These “charts of the
crosses” are the ones that are prepared prior to the third initiation, at which
time the man begins his “approach” to the Cardinal Cross of the heavens. I
would here remind you, e'en though it is a piece of useless information, that
the fifth major initiation of our planet is the first cosmic initiation, just as
the third initiation is the first systemic. The two first initiations are planetary
in their implications. The above statement has deep and esoteric astrological
significance. 3. Spiritual Effects of the Zodiacal Constellations.
I am now going to outline to you the spiritual effect of the passage of a soul
around the wheel of experience. We will attempt to consider, in the case of
each constellation, the general effect upon a soul—undergoing the
experience—from the orthodox angle as he travels from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces, and then—as the disciple, coming under other influences—travels
from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. Thus the usual process is reversed and the
man reorients himself and “faces the East,” as it is esoterically called. He
expresses [91] then in the highest possible manner the qualities of his soul
ray as, in the first case, he expressed the quality of the personality ray.
It is not possible for me to be more specific. I seek only to give certain
spiritual implications and hints and to convey a general idea of the effect of
the great illusion upon resultant conditions and, secondly, the result of the
great tests which every disciple eventually undergoes as he reverses the
wheel of life. ARIES, THE RAM
Strictly speaking, what I have to say now concerns the pure first ray type
because Aries is the zodiacal sign through which the first Ray of Will or
Power reaches our planetary life . Such pure types are rare indeed and at
this period of evolution well-nigh unknown. Most people are governed by
their personality ray and as the present first ray types are expressing
themselves through personalities which are on all the rays, I would simply
ask you to consider what I have to say from the angle of character effects, of
problems presented and of quality unfolded. It is well nigh impossible to be
more explicit until such time as the Science of the Rays has been further
developed; the astrologer must ascertain the ray type before he will be able
to cast the adequate horoscope of the soul. My remarks are therefore general
and not specific and are universal and not particular. I impose no doctrine. I
indicate phases of speculation which might prove illuminating and fruitful.
Aries is one of the constellations of the Cardinal Cross of the heavens. This
is the cross of God, the Father, and, therefore, of the incarnating monad. It is
the expression of will or power as it expresses itself through the great
creative process. When the initiate (as we shall later [92] see) transfers
himself on to the Cardinal Cross from which he descended when coming
into incarnation and mounted in its place the Common or Mutable Cross, he
no longer identifies himself with form or even with soul, but with the will of divinity and with the eternal plan and purpose. It becomes his plan and
purpose. He knows no other in a sense which is unknown even to an initiate
of the third degree. He then enters into the council chamber of God; he
becomes a part of the conclave at Shamballa; he functions no longer simply
as a member of the Hierarchy upon the mental plane. He can now function
through all the three world centres—Humanity, the Hierarchy and
Shamballa.
Aries initiates the cycle of manifestation. All souls, as individual entities,
come into human incarnation for the first time in the sign of Cancer ,
emerging as mental entities in the sign Aries, as emotional-desire entities in
the sign Taurus and as vital entities in the sign Gemini, taking then physical
form in Cancer . This is an involutionary, subjective cycle. Thus they
emerge into the ocean of physical plane existence, into the world of matter.
Yet the first impulse is awakened in Aries, for Aries is the place where the
initial idea to institute activity takes form. It is the birthplace of ideas, and a
true idea is in reality a spiritual impulse taking form—subjective and
objective. There originates the response of the soul to the highest aspect or
quality of deity because there appears the “will to incarnate.” The first ray
aspect of the Monad, responding to the first aspect of deity, evokes response
from the first ray aspect of the soul and the first step towards incarnation is
taken on that plane in the system which is the mental plane. Aries “awakens
the will to reach the lowest and there control, to know the uttermost and
thus to face all experience”—thus runs an ancient statement.
[93] The keynotes of the sign Aries are four in number, all conveying the
same idea. They can be expressed in the following four injunctions which
are given, symbolically, to the incarnating soul:
1. Express the will to be and do.
2. Unfold the power to manifest.
3. Enter into battle for the Lord. Júpiter . Arrive at unity through effort. Creation—Being—Activity—Strife—Synthesis, these are the nature of the
Lord of the first constellation and enable Him to influence our planet to
these results.
And thus the great cycle of struggle towards expression starts and the
foundational words of The Secret Doctrine , with which you are all so
familiar, expresses the goal and the purpose of the first sign of the Cardinal
Cross:
“Matter is the vehicle for the manifestation of soul on this plane of
existence, and soul is the vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation
of spirit, and these three are a trinity synthesised by life which pervades
them all.”—S.D. I. 80.
What appears in Aries as spiritual energy enters into the soul stage in
Cancer , in which sign the soul incarnates for the first time in form, reaches
a point of equilibrium in Libra , in which sign soul and personality achieve
a balance of cooperation and, in Capricorn , the will nature arrives at
fulfilment and a visioned goal is reached. In Capricorn , the man reaches
either the height of personal ambition or he becomes the initiate, attaining
his spiritual objective. The difference between these two goals depends
upon the mode of progression around the wheel of life. It should be
remembered—generalising again and speaking symbolically—that the
Crosses also turn, being the spokes of the great [94] wheel. The
undeveloped man goes from Aries to Capricorn and to Libra and Cancer,
whilst the developed man reverses the process. We could, for the sake of
clarity, consider the great experience of life as taking place upon the three
wheels within the wheel of Life, viewing it from three angles:
I. Gêmeos . 1. The Wheel of Incarnation.
2. The cycle of ordinary evolution.
3. The period of captivity, wherein the man is bound upon the wheel. Júpiter . The fourfold influence of the Common Cross .
5. Life in the three worlds.
6. The development of personality.
1. The Wheel adjusted or reversed . 2. The cycle of discipleship.
3. The period of emergence, wherein the man alters the revolution of the wheel. Júpiter . The fourfold influence of the Fixed Cross .
5. Life in the five worlds of superhuman evolution.
6. The unfoldment of soul through the personality.
III. 1. The wheel controlled or dominated.
2. The cycle of initiation.
3. The period of liberation from the work of the Great Wheel. Júpiter . The fourfold influence of the Cardinal Cross.
5. Life in the seven worlds of our seven planes.
6. Fusion of spirit, soul and personality. Aries, therefore, starts the process of the “most ancient initiation” which all
the human family has already undergone [95] and will undergo. The first
great cosmic initiation (as far as humanity is concerned) is initiation into
incarnation—the initiation of individualisation. This process culminates
aeons later in the reversing of the wheel and the attaining of a definite goal
in Capricorn. It culminates in the achievement of transference from off the
Fixed Cross on to the Cardinal Cross, which is, in its turn, the logical
sequence of the transference from off the Mutable or Common Cross on to
the Fixed Cross. Therefore, in its lowest manifestation, Aries is the creator
of those activities, conditions and processes which lead to the manifestation
of soul through the medium of form, and later of those higher creative
undertakings which lead in due time to the manifestation of spirit through
the soul. These processes eventually demonstrate the true nature of the
triplicity to which I introduced you in the earlier pages of this treatise: Life
—Quality—Appearance.
Aries is also the purveyor to our solar system of Fire (Electric Fire) and of
the dynamic nature of God which has in it the qualities of fostering and
nourishing heat and also of the fire which burns and destroys. From the
standpoint of esoteric astrology, there are three major signs in which the
“three deaths” are undergone:
1. Aries , which at different points along the Path of Life forces the soul
on to the burning ground and subjects it to a purifying process during
incarnation. Through the lesser fire of mind, the “jungles of experience are set on fire and dissolve in flames and then the Path
stands clear and unobstructed vision is achieved.” — Old
Commentary
Through the fiery processes of war and strife, brought to the individual
through the influence of the planetary [96] ruler, Mars, the God of
War, a needed purification takes place. The same purification, but this
time through vision, comes to the developed man through the activity
of the subjective ruler of the planet, Mercury, who is the illuminating
principle which releases the mind, directs the way of man through life
and enables him to become aware of the divine Plan which underlies
all his fiery experience.
2. Scorpio , which brings about eventually the death of the personality
and with which we shall later deal when we come to consider that
sign. Esoterically as well as exoterically, Scorpio is the sign of death
and burial in the earth, of descent into the depths in order to be lifted
again on to the heights (the mountain top in Capricorn ). It is stated in
some of the most ancient books that “the heat of the earth, the mother,
and the sting of the scorpion are the beneficent gifts which the turning
of the wheel gives to the man at the beginning and the end.” These
gifts, when accepted and used, bring a man to liberation and
eventually from the control and pain of the Fixed Cross.
3. Pisces sees the relinquishing or the death of all the influences which
hold the man to the wheel of birth and his release from the control of
the Common or Mutable Cross.
It is interesting to note that each of these three signs of death is to be found
in a different cross:
1. Aries . . . . . . .The cardinal cross
2. Scorpio . . . . .The fixed cross
3. Pisces . . . . . .The mutable cross
It is the influence of these three which brings about the [97] “three needed
and determined deaths” in the life of the human being. I am here referring to the signs, independently of their planetary rulers. There is something in the
energy which pours in through these signs which pre-determines a
crystallising process and the eventual destruction of some type of form
control. The Old Commentary expresses these ideas in the following terms:
“The fire blazed forth and through that fire I died to life and so was
born to death. And then again I died to form (Aries).
The heat of earth, the fiery temper of the mother, destroyed the form,
released the soul and so the lesser self was killed (Scorpio).
The waters drowned the man. The fish was made to disappear. It then
appeared again only to die or else to die and bring salvation” (Pisces).
Thus there are symbolically the death through fire, the death through earth
and the death through water—burning, suffocation and drowning—but, in
this world cycle, the death through air is not either known or understood.
There are not therefore four deaths, as the goal of our system during
manifestation is “initiation or release into the air,” so that the bird of life out
of time and space can fly free. The concept which the Law of
Correspondence brings of the final death is covered by the words liberation,
relinquishment and final initiation, and means little to humanity, for it
concerns the planetary Logos and His life cycle. The three deaths which do
overtake man, the individual and the human family as a whole, release the
soul into three great planetary centres:
1. The death by drowning or by water in Pisces releases man again into
that great centre which we call Humanity, [98] and there experience is
gained. Herein lies the mystery of the fish-goddesses of this sign
“who spawn their young again and yet again.”
2. The death by suffocation in Scorpio releases man into the planetary
centre which we call the Hierarchy.
3. The death by fire or burning in Aries releases man into another centre
to which we give the name Shamballa. There is much to work out, is there not, in these ideas which I offer to you
as suggestive considerations and as hints related to the Science of Triangles,
which is the esoteric basis of astrology, just as the doctrine of the trinity
(microcosmic and macrocosmic) is the esoteric basis of occultism. Death is,
therefore, of three kinds. This Science of Divine Dying underlies the wellknown phrase “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,” and when
the relationship between Aries, Scorpio and Pisces is properly understood
(as the linking and merging of the three crosses) a new light will be thrown
upon all subsidiary sciences—exoteric and esoteric. The teaching in The
Secret Doctrine about the reincarnating monads who are called the divine
Sacrifices, Lords of Knowledge, Will and Sacrifice, will be clarified. These
monads, who are ourselves, are Lords of Persevering Ceaseless Devotion —
devotion even unto death.
It is interesting here to note also that through the ruling planet, Mars, the
average man born in this sign is related to Scorpio, and thus the Cardinal
Cross is related to the Fixed Cross. Points of crisis can thus be noted when
the horoscope is considered from this angle. At the same time, Aries is
related to birth, through Mercury who rules Aries esoterically, and also
Virgo, of which Mercury is the exoteric ruler. Through Uranus also, Aries is
related to Aquarius, [99] the sign of world service, leading to death and
liberation in Pisces. Uranus is the planet through which zodiacal energy
flows, in connection with the Creative Hierarchies upon our planet, from
one of the stars of the Great Bear. It is these relationships with which
esoteric astrology deals, and from them the universal can be grasped and the
particular understood. The human being in his eventual recognised group
relationships is of more importance than appears in his individual life,
which the orthodox horoscope seeks to elucidate. It only determines his
little destiny and unimportant fate. Esoteric astrology indicates his group
usefulness and the scope of his potential consciousness.
I would remind you here that frequently when the ruler of a sign is given as
the Sun or the Moon I shall speak of one of the hidden planets, Uranus or
Vulcan. These are interchangeable in their use and it is difficult to tell to which the esoteric planet refers unless you have been told. Hence my above
reference to Uranus.
In connection with Aries, which expresses or is the agent primarily of the
first Ray of Will or Power, the ray of the destroyer, it should be stated that
first ray energy comes from the divine Prototype in the Great Bear, that it
becomes transmuted into the force and activity of the planetary Logos of the
first ray, and works out as His triple activity under the guidance of the three
ruling planets—Mars, Mercury and Uranus.
Mars embodies sixth ray force which leads to idealism, destructive
fanaticism frequently, struggle, strife, war, effort and evolution. God's idea
in Aries becomes the concrete plan in Capricorn whether that objective is
the full flower of the planetary life in all its forms, the ambition of a
personality working out its own ideas and ambitious worldly projects or the
spiritual aspiration (worldly ambition [100] transmuted into its higher
aspect) of the initiate, who seeks to work out God's plans and make them his
own. In every case, Mars leads to the battle ground of Scorpio.
Mercury , embodying the energy of the fourth ray, eventually carries the
man around the wheel of life and through the medium of conflict enables
him to achieve harmony. Mercury illumines the mind and mediates between
the soul and the personality, being the Messenger of the Gods. This
mediatorship, in the first instance, produces an inevitable opposition
between the pairs of opposites and a long drawn out conflict. This conflict
finally works out into victory and the dispelling of illusion through the
illumination of the lower mind. Mercury and the Sun are one , we are
frequently told in the occult literature. The Sun is the symbol of the Son of
God, Who is the mediator between Father-Spirit and Mother-Matter.
Mercury, therefore, leads Aries to Virgo (again speaking symbolically)
where the idea or Word of God begins to take form, and consequently the
latent life in Aries comes to the “crisis of the birth hour,” prior to the birth
of the Christ, cosmically considered, though the birth of the individual
Christ takes place in Capricorn, at the close of the needed gestation period. Uranus embodies the energy of the seventh ray and its work is analogous to
that of Mercury, for the seventh ray is the ray which relates spirit and matter
and brings together electric fire and fire by friction, thus producing
manifestation. Uranus leads the soul to the burning ground during the final
stages of the Path, when the fire of Aries and the fires engendered through
the potency of Uranus produce the flaming heat of the final burning ground.
Through this burning ground, the initiate has finally to pass. Uranus rules
the occult Way and is, in an esoteric sense, connected with the Hierophant
of the Mysteries of Initiation.
[101] Therefore, we have in relation to Aries and the life of the soul, which
there comes into subjective manifestation, certain related signs wherein the
soul, in objective manifestation, passes through peculiar and definite crises:
1. The crises of the battle field, leading to the culminating battle in
Scorpio and the liberation into life in Capricorn, the place of the
higher initiations, after the reversal of the wheel.
2. The crisis of the birth place in Virgo, brought about through the
activity of Mercury, leading through Leo to the birth of the Christ in
Capricorn. The self-conscious individual in Leo becomes the Christconscious Initiate in Capricorn.
3. The crisis of the burning ground, which is brought about through the
activity of Uranus. This is entered through the free choice of the
initiate who makes his choice in Libra, the point of balance where—
usually—the moment for the reversal of the wheel takes place. There
the man has to decide whether to proceed as usual and according to
custom or, reversing the wheel, to pass through the burning ground to
liberation. Libra is the polar opposite to Aries and therefore closely
related.
You will note that the rays which are related to or expressing themselves
through Aries are curiously balanced, Rays 1 and 7 are the highest and the
lowest, and therefore demand a point of balance upon the wheel which is
provided in Libra. Rays 6 and Júpiter bring to this balancing process the energy of the second ray, the major building ray which enables the man to build anew
and provide himself with a spiritual body of manifestation.
I would also call your attention to the fact that through Uranus, Aries is
related to Aquarius. The vague beginnings [102] in Aries, the faint
emergence of the latent embodied ideas have—after the turning of the wheel
in two directions—brought release in Capricorn and produced the world
server in Aquarius, who voluntarily stays upon the great wheel (using the
Cardinal Cross as his conditioning signs) and thus staying within the sphere
of influence in order to help humanity to find liberation from the Fixed
Cross.
In the sweep of the zodiac there are four signs which are signs of birth, of
beginning and of renewed cyclic realisation.
1. Aries , the “birthplace of divine Ideas,” whether these ideas are souls
brought into incarnation and controlled by Mars until they reach the
point of reorientation and become sensitive to the influence of
Mercury, or whether they are the birth of the ideas of God in the form
of the hierarchical plans to which the initiate becomes sensitive.
2. Cancer , the “birthplace into the life of form,” the door into physical
incarnation. This is the sign in which humanity, as a whole integrated
unit, is born, the scene of the emergence of the fourth kingdom in
nature. Humanity has “emerged from rock and water and brings its
habitation with it” (as the Old Commentary expresses it) and mass
instinctual consciousness comes into being. Note that phrase.
3. Leo , the “birthplace of the individual,” the coming into form of
individual self-conscious man who emerges out of the mass and herd
in Cancer, substituting, for instinctual consciousness, self-awareness
and a sense of responsibility of an individual kind. Júpiter . Capricorn , the “birthplace of the Christ,” the place of the “second
birth” and the scene for the emergence of [103] the fifth kingdom in
nature when the right time comes. In this sign, the initiate comes into
a spiritual awareness which demonstrates later in Aquarius and in Pisces as man, the world worker, and man, the world saviour—both of
them with a universal mission.
It is from hints such as these that the astrologer of the future will determine
the type of horoscope which should be cast. Two questions will then arise,
requiring reasoned answers:
1. Is the subject a personality , progressing around and around the wheel,
perfecting self-consciousness and developing a rounded out
personality through experience and the working of the Law of Karma,
subject to the Great Illusion and arriving eventually at the height of
personality ambition in Capricorn?
2. Or, is this person beginning to manifest as a soul , pouring light
through dense fogs of illusion, and preparing for the major tests in
Scorpio, to be followed by initiation in Capricorn?
Subsidiary questions would, for instance be: For which death is the man
preparing? Is there an imminent crisis at hand which indicates a birth into
some new state of consciousness? The crucial question, however, to be
determined in every case, is the direction in which the man is progressing
around the wheel of life. The orthodox horoscope concerns the personality
life and the form is bound upon the “wheel of life as it turns from right to
left” (from Aries to Taurus via Pisces). But the soul is bound to the wheel as
it turns from left to right, going from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. It is this
antagonistic movement of the wheel “turning upon itself” (as it is expressed
in the Bible) [104] which leads to the conflict carried on in the individual
life, in the life of humanity and in the life of the planet. In the early stages of
evolution and upon the Mutable Cross, the consciousness is entirely
identified with life in form and with the life of self-consciousness, selfpreservation and self-enrichment. Then comes an interlude wherein the
consciousness begins to shift into that of the group and becomes identified
with the soul and with soul purpose. The experience of the Fixed Cross
covers this period. It might here be noted that the experience of the three
crosses has a Masonic significance and can be connected with the Blue
Lodge: 1. The Common Cross . . . The E .·. A .·. Degree
2. The Fixed Cross . . . . . . The F .·. C .·. Degree
3. The Cardinal Cross . . . . The M .·. M .·. Degree
Much will come to light in Masonry when its astrological implications are
studied and understood. Much also will be revealed anent individual life and
purpose when the fate of certain planets (when in the various zodiacal signs)
is properly investigated and grasped and their symbolic significances
interpreted. For instance, it is well known theoretically and mathematically
that,
1. The Sun is exalted in Aries. Here the Sun stands for the life of the
spirit which comes to full expression as the result of the great
evolutionary process, initiated in Aries. The life of God which in this
sign is “swung into activity” eventually achieves consummation.
Latency becomes potency and midnight merges into midday. God, the
Father, rules.
2. The power of Venus is lessened in this sign. It is a detrimental sign to
Venus. The reason for this is that when the Sun is exalted and blazes
forth in all its glory, [105] the other lesser luminaries fade out. Just as
the personality is lost sight of in the light of the soul, the solar Angel,
so the soul itself disappears and its power and radiance fade out when
the Presence, which it has hitherto veiled, appears and dominates the
scene at the end of the greater world cycle. We are told that the
incarnating Minds, human beings, the solar Angels, came originally
from Venus, but they in turn give place to the monad, the One. Mind
gives place to intuition and reason to pure perception.
3. Saturn “falls” in Aries. This has two meanings, for this is a dual sign.
First: Saturn is the Lord of Karma, the imposer of retribution and the
one who demands full payment of all debts and who therefore
condemns us to the struggle for existence, both from the form side
and from the soul side. Saturn, therefore, “fell” when man fell into
generation. He “followed the sons of men down into their low place.” Second: Saturn's power is completely ended and his work
accomplished when man (the spiritual man) has freed himself from
Karma and from the power of the two Crosses—the Common and the
Fixed. Esoterically, Saturn cannot follow man on to the Cardinal
Cross.
There is much that could be elaborated along this line but the above will
give a hint as to the esoteric significance of these three happenings within
every sign. They can also indicate much concerning the man whose
horoscope is under consideration.
The decanates can also be dealt with in two ways, according to the direction
in which man is travelling upon the wheel and therefore entering the sign,
speaking in symbols. [106] If he enters Aries when on the Common Cross
he will come under the influence of Mars, the Sun and Jupiter, according to
Sepharial. This means conflict, revelation and the successful satisfaction of
desire and ambition as the aeons pass away. When he reorients himself and
mounts the Fixed Cross, he comes under the influence of Jupiter, the Sun
and Mars, for the initiate and the disciple culminates his career in any of the
signs with a final and dominant struggle and fight. I would remark here that
Alan Leo had a glimpse of the inner significance of the decanates when he
assigned Mars, the Sun and Venus to the three decanates. He touched the
truth of the inner subjective reversal upon the wheel which brings in other
energies and influences when he substituted Venus for Jupiter. Mind and
heart must be coordinated and brought into play when the great reversal
takes place.
We have seen that Aries is the sign of beginnings—the beginning of the
creative process, the first step of the soul (the microcosm of the already
initiated Macrocosm) towards incarnation, the beginning of recurring and
constant cycles of experience, the beginning of the period wherein the soul
changes its direction, its purpose and its method, and finally enters upon that
definitely defined process which we call spiritual regeneration and
initiation. There are four words of vital importance upon which we shall
ring the changes, as we study the path of evolution, or the progress of the soul around the great wheel, both as a personality and as a disciple, headed
towards the final liberating process. These four words express the subjective
impulses and motives and, in reality, introduce four different cycles of
progress upon the Path in its various stages of individualisation to initiation.
They are: [107]
1. Re-creation in which the influence of Cancer, combined with that of
Aries, produces the pull into incarnation upon the physical plane.
2. Regeneration in which the growing influence of the Fixed Cross,
playing upon the Mutable Cross, produces those interior changes
which eventually lead to
3. Reorientation or the great cycle of repolarisation which takes place
through the influence of Libra (the Cardinal Cross) and the “swerving
of the Bull in mid-career,” as it is called in the ancient books. This
process of reorientation leads to a passage around the wheel in which,
steadily and persistently, the inner subjective man comes into outer
manifested expression and the personality recedes into the
background. Finally, there come twelve lives wherein the final stage
of Júpiter . Renunciation is experienced and the disciple or initiate renounces all
for the love of humanity and its service, and lays himself upon the
altar of sacrifice. He achieves, as a result, the final liberation.
This liberation is, in reality, twelve-fold in nature, for liberation, victory and
triumph have to be experienced in every sign, just as captivity, defeat and
failure have been experienced in all the signs of the zodiac, whilst the man
is functioning as a personality. It is these four words and their significance
which will underlie all that I have to say to you anent the dual experience
upon the great wheel of life. I would ask you to bear this definitely in mind.
Going through the great cycle from Aries to Taurus, the man reenters the
sign Aries again under the potent impression of Taurus, which at this stage
of development feeds his ardent desire for the many material advantages of
physical incarnation and of constant worldly undertakings; thus [108] after a period of re-creation, he passes out into incarnation in Pisces and begins
again the great round of manifested life, for Pisces is the ocean wherein he
is “the fish,” controlled by the laws of substance or material existence. In
the second great stage, he passes from Aries to Taurus, because desire has at
last been transmuted into aspiration. After proving his steadfastness to the
ideal of the spiritual life in the intervening signs, he passes again into
Pisces, from the opposite direction to his usual procedure, having earned the
right to mount the Cardinal Cross of the Heavens, the power to take a final
planetary initiation and the privilege of passing on to one of the seven paths
to which I have made reference in my other books; these eventually give
him “the freedom of the seven solar systems,” as it is called in
contradistinction to “the freedom of the seven planetary spheres,” which the
experience of initiation has guaranteed him, after a process of intensive
training in one or other of the planetary schools (according to his ray type)
and the path of service chosen.
You will see, therefore, the significance of the two keywords of the sign
Aries:
1. “And the Word said: Let form again be sought”
The Man
2. “I come forth and from the plane of mind, I rule”
The Initiate
Experience leads to rulership and in this sign the man who is embodied first
ray force develops the power of organisation, of control over forces,
particularly over the energy of death, over the power of destruction applied
with love, of dominance over multitudes, of cooperation with the plan and
the practice of the Will in rightly and correctly guiding and directing
planetary affairs.
[109] Before we take up the remaining eleven signs of the zodiac, and in
order to give you a clear framework upon which to build the new astrology
by means of which you can grasp the dual procedure of the soul around the great wheel, I would point out that what I have given you on Aries will be
dealt with also as we consider the other signs. You will find that I have
indicated significances and pointed out some of the truths which can be
found in connection with:
1. The keynote of the signs . These express the underlying effect upon the
man as he progresses in one of two directions.
2. The Nature of the Cross upon which the man is crucified at any one
time.
3. The influence of the planetary Rulers —orthodox or esoteric. Júpiter . The Rays which primarily express themselves through a particular
sign; the clue to which sign it may be is found in the orthodox
planetary ruler where the personality ray is concerned and the esoteric
planetary ruler where the soul is concerned.
5. The Qualities of the sign and of the man who has come forth in a
particular sign.
6. The interplay between a sign and its polar opposite.
7. The planets which are exalted , in detriment , or which fall in any
particular sign, for a study of these will indicate the three phases of
the Path—with its involutionary cycle of becoming increasingly
involved in matter, or life upon the Mutable Cross , the interlude of
readjustment or struggle for liberation which leads to the mounting of
the Fixed Cross , and the period of liberation with the final mounting
of the Cardinal Cross . [110]
8. The significance of the key words for the modes of progress through
the signs. Mercúrio . The underlying theme of any specific zodiacal sign, covered by the
ideas of re-creation, regeneration, reorientation and renunciation.
Before taking up these matters in connection with Pisces, there are one or
two points upon which I would like to touch. I have to take up certain
problems as they may arise in the consciousness of the enquirers and the
students, because it is impossible to handle them all at once in the introductory remarks. The confusion would then be well nigh insuperable in
the mind of the enquirer. Little by little, we will deal with the various
debatable points, and if you will have patience and hold back partisan
conclusions, the picture of the new astrology will begin to emerge more
clearly in your minds. At present, the readjustment of your ideas leads to
inevitable temporary bewilderment.
One of the questions which normally arises might be expressed as follows,
and was so expressed by an interested astrological student. It involved the
following inquiry: Granted the inevitability of a man eventually reversing
the mode of his passage through the twelve signs, at what time and in which
sign does the Sun reverse? At what point in the swing of the zodiac can this
reversal in the Sun itself be seen taking place?
Unless you have some grasp of the nature of the great illusion of the
constitution of the Sun, it will be hard for you to understand the significance
of my reply. The sun to which you are referring is the physical Sun and its
apparent path in the heavens. This “appearance” will not outwardly change
and—here is the statement of importance—the real Sun under which our
planetary life will eventually function [111] and to which response will be
made is the Heart of the Sun. When that is controlling, the spiritual man will
then live a dual life simultaneously (which is ever the problem of the man
who is illumined by the soul as well as by the light of day) and this dual life
will consist of our apparent experience and situations and our inner spiritual
soul awareness. The personality will still respond to influences coming to it
from the physical Sun but the motivated life activity and the subjective
experience of the inner man will be conditioned by energies coming to him
from the “Heart of the Sun.” I would here recall to your minds the teaching
of the Ageless Wisdom as given in The Secret Doctrine and elaborated by
me in my later books, that the Sun has to be discovered and known in its
triple nature which is threefold as is the Trinity. The tabulation below may
serve to make this idea somewhat clearer:
1. Physical Sun . . . . . . .
2. Heart of the Sun . . . . Form . . . . Personality. .
Soul Consciousness. . . . Influencing Mutable Cross.
Influencing Fixed Cross. 3. Central spiritual Sun . Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Influencing Cardinal Cross. By the word “influencing” I here refer to the energies pouring from these
three aspects of the Sun through the three Crosses to our planet. Ponder on
this and remember also that our Sun is travelling through space (carrying
our solar system along in its sphere of influence) around our own central
and conditioning star which it has been rightly presumed exists in the
constellation Taurus, the Bull, being found in the Pleiades. At the same time
it appears, from the standpoint of our planet, to be passing through the
twelve signs of the zodiac; this is a symbol macrocosmically considered, of
the dramatic centralised point of view of the individual human being, the
microcosm. It is interesting to [112] compare the symbolism and the
underlying truth connected with the lesser and the greater zodiacs and with
their twelve month and their 25,000 year cycles. They bear out much that I
have given you anent the soul, influenced by the esoteric planets eventually,
and the personality, influenced by the orthodox planets. The greater zodiac
is symbolic of the soul and the lesser of the personality. In the personality
cycle, the lesser zodiac conditions the personality career and the twelve
planetary houses are of dominant importance. Later the influence of the
twelve signs supersedes the influence of the planets.
I would like also to emphasise—perhaps unnecessarily—that Sirius, the
Great Bear and the Pleiades work through the medium of the twelve
constellations, pouring their influences through nine of them in particular,
but that these major constellations are not part of the zodiac with which we
are concerned. They, with the seven solar systems of which ours is one, are
the ten constellations connected with a still greater zodiac which is not
conditioned by the numerical significance of the number twelve. Hence ten
is regarded as the number of perfection. There is confusion in the minds of
some of the less learned students (astrologically considered) on this point.
It is rather difficult for you also to grasp that the involutionary process for
all the kingdoms of nature is related to the passage of the soul (this time the
anima mundi or world soul) from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus and not vice
versa. The anima mundi on the involutionary arc proceeds this way and not as the personality proceeds. The anima mundi passes to Pisces at the close
of every great cycle and not to Taurus. It emerges into outer manifestation in
Cancer, the sign of mass or group life, of mass or [113] group activity; its
diffused consciousness has not yet been individualised as has the
consciousness of man. When the world soul after having progressed around
the Great Wheel, reached Cancer and the time came for the fourth Creative
Hierarchy to manifest through the fourth kingdom in nature, a reversal took
place and then proceeded as now. It should be remembered with emphatic
care that it is only man, individualised man whose progress we are studying,
plus his reactions to zodiacal and planetary influences; we are dealing with
his reactions, mental and emotional, to the great illusion and to spiritual
reality as these two work in his life, objective and subjective. We have, in
the larger issue, to consider the influence of the zodiac and the planets upon:
1. The spirit of the Earth , the embodiment of the physical planet and the
sum total of the form life in all the kingdoms of nature. These are the
expression of the anima mundi or of the world soul.
2. Humanity , the individualised and finally initiated man. This is the
embodiment of the human soul or ego, a differentiation of the world
soul, which expresses itself as a personality (a correspondence to the
spirit of the planet) and finally as a spiritual soul (a correspondence to
the planetary Logos).
3. The Lord of the Planet , one of the great Lives or Sons of God, at
present regarded as “an imperfect God” as far as our planet is
concerned and yet, from the angle of humanity, perfect indeed.
The above triple division expresses the three major aspects of the ancient
and esoteric science of astrology and its three divisions as the Hierarchy
today studies them. Humanity, [114] having lost the consciousness which
permits contact with the spirit of the planet (sub-human consciousness, and
which was the basis of animism) and having not yet developed the
consciousness which permits him to enter into the Life and Mind of the
planetary Logos, has dealt only with the second division and that in its
lowest aspect. Two other points might here be touched upon, and for their understanding
you will have to accept my statements as temporary hypotheses at least, for
you are in no position to know them as truth for yourselves. Exoteric
astrology has said and it is widely accepted that Vulcan, Uranus, Pluto and
Neptune do not govern signs but only have affinity with them. I am
touching upon this here because we are going to consider the planet Pluto in
relation to Pisces. This affinity has only stated a partial truth and is only
temporarily true from the standpoint of the modern astrologer. Their
existence has only been inferred or discovered within the last two or three
centuries though it has always been known to the Hierarchy. I have
indicated to you the signs of which they are the rulers and the astrology of
the future will accept my statement and work with these planets. Much
earlier in human history, they had to accept the fact of Mars and Mercury as
rulers of zodiacal signs in a hypothetical manner, and then start to prove the
accuracy of the hypothesis. Ancient astrology was obviously incomplete but
until man became patently responsive to the influences which come to him
from Uranus or Pluto, for instance, which affect the soul life far more than
they do the personality life, they remained undiscovered except by trained
esotericists. Today, humanity is rapidly responding to the higher spiritual
influences and, therefore, we can look for the discovery of increasingly
subtle forces. PISCES, THE FISHES
[115] This sign is also dual. In Aries we have the duality which is attached
to the bringing together of spirit and matter in the great creative activity of
manifestation at the beginning of the evolutionary cycle, whilst in Pisces we
have the fusion or blending of soul and form as far as man is concerned,
producing the manifestation of the Incarnated Christ, the perfected
individual soul, the completed manifestation of the microcosm. Thus the
greater and the lesser polar opposites—the human being and God, the
microcosm and the Macrocosm—are brought to their destined expression
and manifestation. Until man is nearing the goal, these words mean but little
though a study of the sign Pisces in the two ways intended may reveal much that is significant and suggestive. The goal of Deity, the emergence of God's
plan and the nature of His eternal purpose is for us only a subject of
interested speculation. There is a possibility that this plan and purpose may
be vastly different to our surmise which is based upon our formulation of a
Deity who is the product of our mental processes and of devoted idealism
(two of the three aspects of the personality nature), and the attempt to
interpret His infinite purposes in terms of our own finiteness. Let us always
remember this. The mechanism for divine perception has not yet been
developed in the human family on any large scale and is only achieving
some measure of usefulness in the initiate of the third degree.
This duality of Pisces must be studied in relation to its three keynotes which
are
1. Bondage or captivity.
2. Renunciation or detachment.
3. Sacrifice and death.
[116] In the first cycle of experience upon the wheel, the soul itself is in
captivity to substance; it has come down into the prison house of matter and
linked itself to form. Hence the symbol of Pisces, of the two fishes linked
together by a band. One fish stands for the soul and the other for the
personality or form nature, and between them is to be found the “thread or
sutratma,” the silver cord which keeps them bound to each other throughout
the cycle of manifested life. Later on, upon the reversed wheel, the
personality is brought into captivity by the soul, but for long aeons the
situation is reversed and the soul is the prisoner of the personality. This dual
bondage is brought to an end by what is called the final death, when the
complete release of the life aspect from the life of form takes place. It
should be borne in mind also that the soul itself is of the nature of form from
the standpoint of the Monad, though it is a form far subtler than any that we
know in the three worlds of human evolution. There is also a dual
renunciation referred to in these key words, for first of all the soul
renounces the life and light of the Monad, its source (symbolized by the
words “the Father's home”), and descends into the ocean of matter; then, reversing itself, the soul renounces the life of form, the personality centre.
The soul detaches itself (in consciousness) from the Monad, the One, and
functions from its own centre, making its own new and material
attachments. Then, upon the reversal of the wheel, it proceeds to detach
itself from the personality and re-attach itself in consciousness to the One
Who sent it forth. Such is the climaxing story of Pisces. The Lords of Will
and Sacrifice come down into manifestation, sacrificing their high position
and opportunities upon the higher planes of manifestation in order to
redeem matter and raise the lives by which it is informed (the lower
Creative Hierarchies) to the [117] status of Themselves in so far as They
constitute the fourth Creative Hierarchy. This is the subjective purpose,
underlying the sacrifice of these divine Lives Who are ourselves essentially,
Who are qualified by knowledge, love and will, and animated by ceaseless
persevering devotion. They seek to bring about the death of the form in its
occult significance and the consequent release of the indwelling lives into a
higher state of consciousness. Of this process, all the world Saviours—past,
present and to come—are the manifested symbols and the eternal
guarantees. It is in such recognitions as these that the mainspring to the life
of service must be sought. People born in this sign are frequently to be
found serving the race and ministering to its needs upon some level of
consciousness. Thus they are prepared for the final sacrifice in Pisces which
“absorbs them back into their originating Motive,” as the Old Commentary
expresses it. It is for this reason that the life of service and the directed
intention to serve constitute a scientific mode of achieving release. In
Aquarius, the sign of world service, the lesson is finally learned which
produces the world Saviour in Pisces. Hence my constant emphasis upon
service.
When the individual man enters upon his cycle of incarnations, and emerges
in the sign Cancer, which is found in the Cardinal Cross, he metaphorically
mounts the Mutable Cross and his long term of imprisonment in form
begins and the lessons of servitude must be learned. He goes on learning
until he has transformed servitude into service. He alternates between the
pairs of opposites, both from the astral, emotional angle and from the point of view of the four arms of the Mutable Cross. The fluid, sensitive
temperament in Pisces—mediumistic and psychically polarised—must be
stabilised in Virgo, in which sign mental [118] introspection and critical
analysis become possible and serve to arrest the fluidity of Pisces. These
two signs balance each other. We might study the dual process taking place
upon the wheel through the medium of the Mutable Cross of which Pisces
forms a part in the following manner:
1. Pisces—Here the beginner upon the way of life starts with a material
receptivity which will enable him to respond to all contacts in the
cycle of manifestation. He is, at this stage, negative, fluid and
endowed with an instinctual consciousness which contains within
itself the potentiality of the intuition. But the seed of the intuition is
dormant. The mind which is the instrument of reception from the
intuition is, at this stage, unawakened.
2. Sagittarius—Here the ordinary man begins to demonstrate a tendency
to become more focussed and the fluidity and negativity of Pisces
become concentrated upon the attainment of that which is desired.
The man demonstrates one-pointed selfish instincts and though he
may be, for instance, friendly and kind, it is through a desire for
popularity. This is a good expression of the individual Sagittarian
subject and shows also the tendency of the soul to turn all evil
eventually into good. The lessons of life are being learned and
experiment is going on.
3. Virgo—In Virgo, the man who was fluid in Pisces and emotionally
selfish and full of desire in Sagittarius, begins to focus still more
intently and to reason and think. The latent soul is becoming interiorly
active; a germination process is proceeding; the hidden man is making
his presence felt. The intellect is awakening [119] and instinct—after
passing through the emotional stage—is being transmuted into
intellect. Júpiter . Gemini—In the undeveloped man or the average man, the experiences
undergone on three arms of the Mutable Cross have brought him to the stage where the “dream of life” can be changed into the
recognition of the reality, and the Great Illusion can be seen as
undesirable and untrue. The sense of duality is, at this stage,
instinctual but becoming increasingly real and steadily more complex.
The man begins to dream of stability, of ordered changes and of union
with that which he senses to be the most real part of himself. The
mystical vision emerges into his consciousness and he becomes aware
of the higher self through the first faint flickerings of the intuition.
The experience upon the Mutable Cross lasts a long time, and carries the
man always back again and again into the sphere of influence of Aries
which, through the ruling activity of the first ray, both strengthens the will
of the man (no matter what his ray) and ends cycle after cycle with the
“word of destruction.” Again and again, he enters into the sign Pisces and
finds his way around the great wheel until the experience of change and of
mutability and the establishing of the transmutation process carry his
consciousness from the instinctual and intellectual stages to the faint
beginnings of the intuitive processes in Gemini. Then comes a great process
of polarisation and a moment of transference, after which the influence of
the Fixed Cross causes reversal and the lessons gained upon the Mutable
Cross have to be worked out and the effects demonstrated upon the Fixed
Cross. It must not be thought that, in the early [120] stages of unfoldment,
experience is gained only through the Mutable Cross. The man lives in and
experiences in all the signs, but the influences pouring through the Mutable
Cross have a more potent effect upon him than those pouring in the early
stages through the Fixed Cross. It is only when the soul is becoming more
alive within the form and the man is aware of his duality that the energies of
the Fixed Cross supersede in effectiveness those of the Mutable Cross, just
as after the third initiation the energies of the Cardinal Cross begin to
control the man and are of more insistent incentive than those of the other
two crosses.
When the soul is, therefore, becoming more active, the effect of the Fixed
Cross will be seen working out in the four signs along with the effects of forces of the Mutable Cross for “that which is dominated and relinquished is
held firmly and transformed.”
Gemini—The man upon the reversing wheel in Gemini becomes
increasingly aware of the intuition and increasingly under the
influence of “the Brothers who live in the Light,” as the Twins are
sometimes called. The light of the personality dims and the light of
the soul waxes. The fluidity of Pisces and the undeveloped Gemini
gives place to the responsiveness of the personality to soul impression
and consequent stabilising of the life on the physical plane.
Virgo—The mind, under the influence of Virgo, which has been
analytical and critical, changes to that quality of mind which is best
described by the words, illumination and revelation . The Christ to
whom the Virgin must eventually give birth is recognised as present
in the womb, though not yet born. Life is recognised. The process of
the revelation of the Christ consciousness is [121] carried
intelligently forward and the selfish aspirations and experiments of
the undeveloped man give place to the selflessness of the illumined
and intuitive disciple.
Sagittarius—This is now the sign of the one-pointed disciple. The life of
fluid response to matter becomes that of the focussed response to
spirit and preparation for initiation in Capricorn. The arrow of the
mind is projected unerringly towards the goal.
Pisces—Here, at the final stage, Pisces stands for the death of the
personality and the release of the soul from captivity and its return
into the task of the world Saviour. The great achievement is finished
and the final death is undergone. “There is no more sea” says the
ancient book, which means inevitably the “death of the fishes” and
the release of the imprisoned life into new forms or new cycles of the
divine Adventure.
This Mutable Cross, of which Pisces is one of the arms, is predominantly
the Cross of “repeated incarnations,” of varied experiments under the
various signs and orthodox rulers, and of those many experiences which lead to successive and continuous expansions of consciousness. It is
therefore the cross of the Son of God, the incarnating Christ, though it is, in
relation to this Cross, the Cross of the planetary Christ, just as the Fixed
Cross is that of the individual Christ in each human being, and the Cardinal
Cross is that of the cosmic Christ. It might here be noted that the Cross with
which we are here concerned is that of the mass, and that the consciousness
which it exemplifies is that of the instinctual consciousness and its merging
into the intellectual consciousness; it is the Cross of the anima mundi and of
the human soul before the consciousness of duality is clear in the mind of
the man and before transfer is made on to the [122] Fixed Cross. It is
consequently more closely allied to the Cardinal Cross of the Heavens, for
the mass consciousness, which is the significant consciousness of the
Mutable Cross, becomes the group consciousness or the synthetic
consciousness of divinity, after passing through the interim period or the
“vital interlude” of the intense self-consciousness of the man upon the Fixed
Cross. This human interlude is in the nature of a cross section in the
development of consciousness, but the main emphasis is the unfoldment of
the mass consciousness of all the kingdoms in nature into the group
consciousness of the three highest kingdoms through the mediatorship of the
human kingdom which, through its peculiar and specific type of awareness,
can relate the higher and the lower expressions of divinity. It is here and in
this connection that the sign Pisces is of much importance, as it is the sign
of mediatorship. Mediumship in its true meaning is expressive of the mass
consciousness—impressibility, negativity and receptivity. These points will
become clearer as we study the signs and their many inter-relations. The
thought I wish to convey to you here is that at this stage the influence of
Pisces on the involutionary arc, and as the Sun retrogrades through the
signs, is felt largely in the anima mundi and in the hidden, incarnated and
imprisoned Christ; the germ of the Christ life is psychically impressed,
becoming constantly more sensitive to these psychical impressions, swept
by desire which ever changes, constantly aware of all impinging contacts,
but unable as yet to interpret them correctly, for the mind has not been
awakened adequately in Virgo. This hidden Christ is unable to free itself from “contact with the Water.” That point is eventually reached and is being
reached with great rapidity in the present human stage where another and
major change is deemed desirable and this is the result of the many lesser
[123] changes. Change is ever needed but the method changes itself from
the constant variability and mutability of the Mutable Cross to certain
changes of a major kind which are brought about by a more permanent and
directed life tendency.
The man at this stage has within him the potencies and the characteristics of
the indwelling Christ, but they are not manifesting and are only latent
possibilities for he is as yet entirely controlled by his form nature (the
prison) and his environment. The hidden powers of the soul are negative
and the powers of the form nature are positive and beginning to find
increasingly potent expression. The natural spiritual tendencies of man are
inhibited (for Pisces is often a sign of inhibition and hindrances) and the
natural animal and personality powers—particularly the emotional—are the
obvious and visible qualities of the man. A good deal of symbolism
connected with the latent Christ and the outer expressive personality can be
seen if a study is made of the Biblical story of Jonah and the whale. I have
not time to enlarge upon it here, but it is a parable concerned with the
Piscean stage of consciousness and the awakening of the Christ
consciousness with the consequent dispute which that entails. Jonah stands
for the hidden imprisoned Christ, alive to the perils of the situation, and the
whale of large size stands for the bondage of incarnation and for the
personality.
It is in this dual sign that the imprisoned soul and the personality enter upon
that process which will transmute
1. The lower nature into the higher manifestation.
2. The lower psychical powers into the higher spiritual faculties, i.e.
a. Negativity into positive soul control. [124]
b. Mediumship into mediatorship.
c. Clairvoyance into spiritual perception. d. Clairaudience into mental telepathy and finally inspiration.
e. Instinct into intellect.
f. Selfishness into divine selflessness. Vênus . Acquisitiveness into renunciation. Saturno . Self-preservation into selfless world service.
i. Self-pity into compassion, sympathy and divine understanding.
3. Spiritual and mental inhibition into soul expression and mental
sensitivity. Júpiter . Devotion to the needs of the self into developed devotion and response
to the needs of humanity.
5. Attachment to environment and to personality conditions
(identification with form) into detachment from form and ability to
identify with the soul.
The ordinary low-grade medium is the outstanding example of the worst
aspects of Pisces—negativity, impressionability, animal and
emotional sensitivity with complete undevelopment of the mental
principle. It would be of interest to find out two things scientifically:
1. Whether the majority of the lowest kind of medium (trance mediums
in particular) have Pisces dominant in some powerful manner in their
charts.
2. Whether those mediums who are becoming more positive and more
self -controlled and who are beginning to get a glimpse of the higher
correspondences in their work—mediatorship and interpretive activity
—have not got Virgo appearing somewhere with real potency [125]
and activity. This might indicate the awakening of the mind, in the
first instance, and eventually that there was a shift in the influence
controlling them, from the orthodox planetary rulership to that of the
more esoteric planets. It might be added that spiritualism and the
work of the spiritualistic movement are under the influence of Pisces
with Cancer rising, or in some stages with the reverse—Cancer with
Pisces rising. As regards the rays which express themselves through the planetary rulers
and which absorb or collaborate with the influences of the sign Pisces and
thus influence our planet and humanity, we find a most interesting situation.
Two major rays express themselves through the rulers of Pisces, orthodox
and esoteric: The first Ray of Will or Power, focussed through Pluto, and the
second Ray of Love-Wisdom. It is the interplay of these dual potencies
which:
1. Produces the duality of this sign.
2. Brings about the major problem of Pisces—psychic sensitivity.
3. Causes the lure of the Path, in the first instance the path of evolution
and later the lure of the probationary path with the consequence that
transference to the Fixed Cross (which is all that we can intelligently
comprehend) begins really in Pisces; though impulsed (if I may use
such a word) in Aries it begins and ends in Pisces. Júpiter . Precipitates the process of transmutation and eventual escape through
death.
5. Unfolds the significance, activity and beauty of death and of the work
of the destroyer.
[126] From this it will be apparent how important and powerful is this sign.
Through its orthodox ruler, Jupiter, that force is brought to bear which
“brings all together” and— in this case—relates the two fishes and binds
them together in a functioning relationship. It is the activity consequently of
the second ray force which relates soul and form and brings the two
together, and this magnetic potency is peculiarly descriptive of the activity
of Pisces. From another angle and in a dual sign, this can also be seen
working out in Gemini. In Pisces, there is demonstrated the captivity angle
of relationship and the two fishes are unable to escape from each other; in
Gemini there is also a definite relationship between the two brothers but
there is no connecting band, and in that relationship is latent free choice and
free determination. In connection with a lesser duality found in every human
being, that of head and heart, of mind and love, and of will and wisdom, the
work of Jupiter is to develop these two qualities and bring them into synthetic interplay. Eventually there has to be the complete fusion of love
and mind before a world saviour can manifest and function efficiently, and
this is pre-eminently the final result of the forces of the Mutable Cross, as
they work out the qualities released by the planets active in Pisces,
Sagittarius, Virgo and Gemini. These planets are:
Orthodox—Jupiter and Mercury.
Esoteric—Pluto. The Earth. The Moon (hiding Vulcan) and Venus.
As you know, Pluto stands for death or the region of death; the Earth stands
for the sphere of experience; the Moon or Vulcan stands for the
glorification, through purification and detachment, of matter, and Venus
stands for the emergence of the love principle through the directing power
of the [127] mind. Students will find it interesting to work out the
implications for themselves. Orthodox astrology assigns only two planets to
these four signs, which in itself indicates a definite interplay. Jupiter and its
influences indicate that the way of incarnation is the “beneficent” method of
evolutionary unfoldment and that the way of love-wisdom (2nd ray) is the
way for humanity to go. Mercury indicates that the line of least resistance
for humanity is harmony through conflict, for Mercury expresses the fourth
ray energy which is buddhic, intuitional and expressive of the Christ, as
Mercury and the Sun are one. But the esoteric planets are more explicit in
their inferences and man appears, when ready for their influence, to be
responsive in a fourfold way which he is not in the earlier stages. They
embody the recognitions and the reactions which condition man's
consciousness when he is preparing to transfer off the Mutable Cross and
mount the Fixed Cross. He comes, therefore,
1. Through Venus—under the power of mind, transmuted into wisdom
through the instrumentality of love.
2. Through the Moon—under the bondage of form in order through form
experience to achieve release and the “uplift of matter” in Vulcan.
3. Through the Earth—under the influence of planetary experience
(which is different to individual experience) in order to transmute his
personal consciousness into group awareness. Júpiter . Through Pluto—under the destroying power of death—death of
desire, death of the personality and of all which holds him between
the pairs of opposites, in order to achieve the final liberation. Pluto or
death never destroys the consciousness aspect.
[128] Six planets, therefore, govern the Mutable Cross as far as humanity is
concerned and this in itself is significant, for six is the number of the great
work of the period of manifestation, is the number of “the Beast,” which is
the lower nature as far as man is concerned, and is all that which seeks to
destroy the higher life, but also that which can be controlled and directed
finally by the soul. The significance of numbers enters into this science of
esoteric astrology, and numerology, as it is, per se , a branch of esoteric
astrology. Love—Mind—Experience—Form—Human Understanding—
Death: these are the keynotes of the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human
kingdom and they are embodied in the planetary influences which pour
through these planets from their allied signs. Through the activity of these
forces which work at this stage through the Mutable Cross, man is brought
to a great Crisis of Polarisation and to a point of basic change for which all
the earlier and many changes have prepared him.
It is these words also which, from a different angle, govern the processes
undergone upon the Path of Discipleship and of Probation. The task of the
disciple is to understand their significance in a practical and effective
manner and to deal with the energies which these planets release,
subordinating them to the energies released by the Fixed Cross upon which
he stands, and thus increase their potency through occult combination. It is
by achieving intelligent and active response to the energies released and
earlier mastered through the experience of the Mutable Cross, and by
relating them to the potencies let loose upon him whilst crucified upon the
Fixed Cross, that he learns to prepare himself for the twelve great tests in all
the twelve signs for which the experience of the two Crosses prepares him.
Pisces governs the feet and hence the whole thought of [129] progress, of
attaining the goal, and the treading of the Path of Return has been the
underlying spiritual revelation of the great cycle through which we are passing; also, in the Piscean Age, the lesser cycle out of which we are at this
time moving, it has been the origin of all the teaching given by the world
religions anent the various stages of the Path of Return. Some astrologers
hold also that Pisces governs the generative processes. They are essentially
correct because once a man is nearing or upon the Path he should become
increasingly creative in the higher sense and the physical generative
processes should give place esoterically to regeneration and to creation upon
the mental plane instead of only upon the physical plane. This higher
creative functioning becomes possible under the influence of aspiration and
intuition. This begins to take place when the four esoteric rulers supplement
the activity of the two orthodox rulers. It is interesting to note that the
astrologer, Alan Leo, suggests Neptune as an alternative to Jupiter. He
sensed and touched upon a mystery of initiation though he did not realise
the magnitude of his discovery. Neptune focusses the influence of Pisces as
it concerns humanity as a whole and not just the individual man, but this
only takes place towards the final stages of the Path of Discipleship. Today
humanity is moving rapidly towards the position of the World Disciple, and
intuiting this, he suggests Neptune as an alternative to Jupiter.
Esoterically, the reason that Venus is exalted in Pisces is connected with the
relation of Pisces to the sign Gemini, of which Venus is the esoteric ruler,
and also in relation to the fact that Venus is the Earth's alter ego and is
closely related to the human kingdom. This subject is too vast and
complicated to be elaborated here, but the point should be remembered. The
Fishes in Pisces are bound together, as [130] we have seen, and this is a
symbol of the captivity of the soul in form, prior to the experience upon the
Fixed Cross. The Twins in Gemini are symbols of the same basic duality,
but the experience of the many changing incarnations has done its work, and
the Band (uniting the two fishes) is in process of dissolution, for part of the
work of Pluto is to “cut the thread which binds the two opposing lives
together.” It is the task of Venus to “reunite the severed lives but with no
binding thread.” Therefore, Venus is exalted in Pisces and at the end of the
greater cycle, the Sons of God who are the Sons of Mind are raised up into
glory through experience and crucifixion because they have learned to love and truly reason. The influence of Pisces, Gemini and Virgo is eventually
fused and blended (symbolically the Cross must always become the line and
then the point). Sagittarius, which is governed esoterically by Mother Earth,
produces those conditions whereby the Path itself achieves glorification.
Consequently, you have at the end of the age (I refer here to a greater round
of the zodiac and to no shorter cycle), the glorification of Venus, of Virgo,
the Virgin, and of Mother Earth—two planets and one constellation—and all
these are potencies which produce definite changes in the solar system.
They represent the three divine potencies of matter and of substance, plus
the force of Sagittarius driving them on to a still greater consummation.
There is a wide and interesting field of research to be found in the relation
of
1. The planet Venus—ruler of the constellation Gemini.
2. The Earth on which we live, called often “Mother Earth.”
3. The Fish-goddesses of the sign Pisces. Júpiter . Virgo, the Virgin. [131]
Gemini and Sagittarius are connected through their ruling planets (because
the Earth is more closely related to Venus than to any other planet) and thus
again you have the six potencies which produce release from the bondage of
form, entered into in Cancer as far as the mass of humanity is concerned (by
this I mean the birth of the human kingdom) and in Pisces as far as the
individual is considered.
In pointing out the significance of the above facts, I am not considering the
orthodox astrological reasons for the exaltation and the fall of certain
planets in certain signs, I am concerned with the effect of the waxing and
the waning influence upon the subject, man. Bear this in mind and—at the
same time—remember that we are occupied with the Great Illusion which it
is the major task of man in this particular world cycle to master and
dissipate, and so to inaugurate the reign of the Real. It is the revelation of
the Real which is the task all initiates undertake after the final experience of
the twelve final tests in the twelve signs. Therefore, when we find that the power of Mercury is lessened in Pisces and that it finally “falls” in that sign,
what is the esoteric and spiritual meaning? Simply, that after the stage of
initiation in Capricorn, as the result of the reversal of the wheel and the
consequent experiences , and after the triumph of Scorpio, the power of the
mind lessens steadily till finally (like other aspects of form life in the three
worlds) it comes to an end and its meaning and illuminating aspects
between soul and physical brain are no longer required. The man, coming
definitely into full soul consciousness, requires now no mediator but deals
directly himself with his emanating source. Mercury is then met with again
under another name, this time as the Sun, mediating between the higher
aspects—soul and spirit—for [132] Mercury and the Sun are One. Through
Mercury, the mind is illumined and relation is established between
personality and the soul. As Mercury, the Sun—the mediator—shifts to a
still higher plane and is no longer mediator between two different stages in
consciousness but between life and consciousness itself; this is a very
different matter and effects the higher understanding. This will necessarily
be incomprehensible to you at present for it is not a mediatorship between
differences but a fusion of what is already related. Are you any the wiser for
that statement?
The same symbolic mode of interpretation must govern also our
understanding of the three decanates. Both Leo and Sepharial give a list of
the decanates and between them there is much resemblance but there is,
however, an important difference. Leo approaches the closer to the esoteric
interpretation of astrology whilst Sepharial is purely exoteric. According to
Sepharial, the three decanates are governed by Saturn—Jupiter—Mars,
presenting opportunity to work off karma and to be successful in so doing
and indicating the method employed, that of conflict and of war. Leo gives
us Jupiter, the Moon and Mars. He indicates, therefore, the success which is
incident to proved discipleship and consequent readiness for initiation, the
seeing of the vision with which Jupiter rewards the disciple, and the
experience which Vulcan confers. Vulcan has been hitherto hidden, but its
influence has steadily superseded all lunar control, for the personality or
form side of life is lost to sight in the radiance of the Sun, the soul. The light of Vulcan and the light of the Sun are one light and these three—Mercury,
Vulcan and the Sun—stand for a synthesis and a radiance which eventually
dims the light of Mercury and it “falls” into the background and Vulcan too
becomes invisible and only the Sun remains. We have consequently a [133]
vision of the Sun, the experience of the personality and effort, which is the
mode of attainment governed by Mars.
The keywords of this sign are obvious in their implications. Where the
personality is concerned and the wheel rotates in the normal manner for the
ordinary average or undeveloped person, the Word is “And the Word said,
Go forth into matter.” The command of the soul to its instrument during the
earlier stages of evolution goes forth and the response comes immediately
from the one who “blinds the soul to truth, holding it in durance vile.” These
words you are amply able to interpret for yourselves and from your own
standpoint which is the only standpoint of service to you, indicating to you
what lies behind upon the path of evolution, the point upon the Path where
you now stand and the immediate step, vision, experience and effort which
lie ahead.
In closing what I have to say about the constellation Pisces, I would, at this
point, make one practical suggestion which will save students much trouble
in the long run. Gather together, as you read, the statements I make anent
any particular sign, planet or major constellation. You will then have right
under your eye the information needed on any specific point and can study
successfully this complicated transitional astrology. And yet, is it any more
complicated to the beginner than a textbook on physics or chemistry? I think
not. What does complicate the problem is your feeling of doubt and
questioning as to the truth and the verifiability of the statements made. Yet
the beginner in chemistry has to accept the statements of the expert who has
written his textbook, and does so accept them until the time comes when he
can verify them himself through experiment. You might in this connection
retort by saying that the conclusions presented to him have been tested again
and [134] again for centuries in many cases and for decades in others, and
that there is little real room for questioning. This is equally true of the science of astrology, for its foundations have been tested for millenia of
years and have proven correct and its experts are wiser and more synthetic
and selfless in their application of the science than are any other group of
scientists. I refer here to the true esoteric astrologers who stand behind the
astrological movement in the world today. I would ask you to remember this
and to regard yourselves as beginners, leaving conclusions on one side until
you have grasped more of the essentials and the theory. For this exoteric
astrology may have prepared you, in some cases. AQUARIUS, THE WATER CARRIER
This constellation is one of supreme importance to our solar system at this
time, for it is the sign into which our Sun is rapidly moving and its influence
is gaining in momentum and added potency with each vanishing decade. It
is, therefore, largely responsible for the changes now being effected in our
planetary life in all the kingdoms of nature, and, because it is an air sign, its
influence is all pervasive and inter-penetrating. To many types of mind, this
influence is intangible and must, therefore, be unable to produce the desired
results; yet the fact is that these intangible pervasive results are of far greater
potency and are far more extensive in their effects than the more concrete
and spectacular happenings. It is not my intention here to deal with these
subjective and potent effects. I have indicated much and have hinted at more
in my other writings. I am only generalising in this delineation of the
subjective significance of the twelve signs, and seeking to give a broad and
not detailed picture [135] of what I might call the lines of the new astrology,
its mode of approach to the more esoteric aspects involved in the soul
horoscope. The new astrology will deal with significances and meanings,
and not so much with the symbols and the outer happenings such as events
and mundane activities.
The keynotes of this sign are three in number and very easy to understand,
though when they make their note felt on the reversing wheel, most difficult
to demonstrate. They are: 1. The service of the personality, the lower self, which eventually
transmutes itself into the service of humanity.
2. Superficial and selfish activity which changes into a deep and active
intention to be active on behalf of the Hierarchy.
3. Self-conscious living which changes finally into a sensitive
humanitarian awareness.
The quality of these keynotes changes from a petty and superficial nature to
one of deep purpose and profound conviction. The low grade and
undeveloped Aquarian upon the Mutable Cross manifests through a
superficial self-awareness. This matures in Leo and becomes a deep-seated
self-consciousness and a profound interest in self and its need and wishes.
As the interplay goes on between Leo and Aquarius (for they are polar
opposites) there comes a deepening of all qualities and the superficialities
disappear until—upon the reversed wheel—the intensive self-consciousness
of Leo expands into the group awareness of Aquarius. The individual
becomes the universal. Man, alone and separative, becomes mankind in his
reactions and awareness and yet, at the same time, preserves his
individuality; he is no longer just a human being, individually self-centred
[136] and separative, but becomes humanity itself, losing his personal
identity in the good of the whole yet retaining his spiritual Identity. From
self-service, he proceeds to world service and yet is always the
individualised Son of God until after the third initiation.
As one studies these twelve signs, it is interesting to trace the relation of
consciousness to the preceding sign and to the succeeding sign. It is
peculiarly so in connection with the sign Aquarius. The material, earthly
quality of Capricorn becomes “dissolved into the air” in Aquarius. The
individual “fish” of the other sign becomes eventually the soul, and soul
quality emerges, and on the reversed wheel it demonstrates as the
pervasiveness of wisdom (Pisces) and the universal love of the truly
developed Aquarian. On the wheel as it “rolls onward into illusion,” the
wheel of the personality, the superficiality and the airy nature of the
undeveloped Aquarian deepens gradually into the concrete and rocky material nature of the Capricornian. The average man in Aquarius puts all
his wares into the window, and often in the room behind the window there is
little to be found. Esoterically, the developed Aquarian puts all he has into
his water pot, storing it there for service and giving it freely on demand to
meet a need.
The sign Aquarius is also a dual sign and signifies two vibrations. It is here
that its relation to Pisces emerges, for just as Pisces on the wheel of illusion,
the Mutable Cross, stands for substance and bondage, in Aquarius,
substance and the anima mundi or imprisoned soul begin to work in mutual
tolerance, and in the higher Aquarian individual, soul and spirit are
expressing themselves through substance. There is consequently an
astrological relation between the band of stars in the constellation Pisces,
which unites the two fishes, and the quality and nature of Aquarius [137]
which relates and binds together into one working and synthetic whole. The
Aquarian recognises the bond which holds all together subjectively and in
truth, whilst in Pisces the energy of relationship constitutes an imprisoning
band which confines and holds captive. Think this out. It is an error to
consider the margin of contact between two signs in the passage of the Sun
to be in the nature of hard and fast frontiers or set boundary lines. Such is
not the case. There are no rigid lines of demarcation separating two entirely
different areas of experience and consciousness upon the solar path. It only
appears to be so and this itself is part of the Great Illusion.
The rulers of Aquarius are of a peculiar interest. They constitute an effective
group of planets and bring in the influences of the seventh, second and
fourth rays. These are pre-eminently the rays which determine the final
stages of man's progress as well as the initial stages, being more potent at
the beginning of the involutionary path and the end of the evolutionary path
than they are in the middle period. They determine the final stages and
happenings of the Path of Initiation. The seventh ray brings into expression
upon the physical plane the major pairs of opposites—spirit and matter—
and relates them to each other, producing eventually one functioning whole.
The second ray gives soul expression and spiritual consciousness and also the power to pour out love and wisdom upon earth whilst the fourth ray
indicates the field of service and the mode of attaining the goal. This mode
or method is that of conflict and struggle in order to reach harmony and thus
express all truly human characteristics, for the fourth ray and the fourth
Creative Hierarchy constitute essentially one expression of truth.
Some astrologers assign Saturn as one of the rulers. [138] Alan Leo does so,
but I would point out that in this case he is dealing entirely with the progress
of the ordinary man upon the wheel of life, and the Saturn which he senses
as ruling Aquarius is the Saturnian influence of Capricorn, in which sign
Saturn governs in two fields. On the reversed wheel, the Saturnian influence
exhausts itself in Capricorn and the man is then free from karma and needs
no presentation of opportunity for he stands a free initiate, a true Master
Mason and can then proceed with world service undeterred and held back
by no thought of self or selfish desire. He comes then under the influence of
Uranus, that mysterious and occult planet. His will is focussed and
developed by the Uranian influences and he develops into a leader. He
brings about desired changes and produces those new conditions which will
help the soul of humanity to express itself more freely. Water being the
symbol of substance and of material expression plus emotional motivation,
Aquarius is consequently dual in its activity, and the third ray expresses
itself powerfully through this sign, reaching our planet through Uranus and
the Moon which hides or veils Uranus symbolically in this case. There is,
therefore, to be found the double influence of Uranus, expressing the quality
and bringing in the energies of the seventh ray, in one case, and the third ray
in the other. The seventh ray is, in the last analysis, the focussed
differentiated energy of Ray One as it expresses the will of the first aspect of
divinity on earth through the power to relate and bring into objective
manifestation—by an act of the will—both spirit and matter. This it brings
about through the activity of Ray Three, expressing itself through humanity
and its individual units, though combining with the energy of the three rays
which are released through the ruling planets: [139] 1. Uranus—Ray Seven—The will to be and to know simultaneously on
all planes of manifestation.
2. Jupiter—Ray Two—The fusion of heart and mind, which is the
subjective purpose of manifestation. This is brought about through the
third and the seventh ray activity on the exoteric wheel.
3. The Moon—Ray Four—The will to be and to know plus the fusion of
heart and mind is the result of the work carried forward in the fourth
Creative Hierarchy under the influence of that energy which produces
harmony through conflict.
I would here call your attention to the fact that in connection with the Moon,
as it is related here to one of the Creative Hierarchies, you have in the Moon
itself the exoteric influences of the ordinary mode of procedure upon the
wheel of life, and in the planet which it veils and hides (in this case the
planet Uranus) you have the esoteric energy which brings this Hierarchy to
subjective realisation.
Uranus gives innate spontaneous activity and this produces evolutionary
development—both natural and spiritual. It is the urge to better conditions.
Jupiter gives an inherent tendency to fusion which nothing can arrest. The
achievement of ultimate synthesis is inevitable, and this Jupiter promotes.
The Moon brings about the inclination to create these conditions which lead
to the great and critical transformations of instinct into intellect. This the
moon brings about, but Uranus causes the great transference in the human
consciousness from intellectual perception to intuitive knowledge. Bear in
mind that the esoteric forces combine with the forces of the exoteric or
orthodox planets and that they do not negate their influence. They only
supplement [140] and dominate them. The man is thereby enriched and his
experience is extended and his consciousness expanded by the new energies,
but all the time the effects and conditioning achieved and attained under the
old influences are not altered. They have “determined” his nature and fixed
his qualities and, therefore, remain persistent and energetic, but the new and
deeper influences and potencies are those which in the future upon the Fixed Cross will condition and motivate gradually and steadily all his activities. In
the future, instead of speaking of the orthodox planets when dealing with
the planetary influences we will speak of the exoteric and the esoteric
planets and so bring our vocabulary and definitive words more into line with
the inner teaching. In astrology, we are dealing all the time with the energies
which produce movement and subjective and outer activity; we are
concerned with the impact of many forces upon the human, the planetary
and the systemic expression of life and purpose, and with the resultant
effects. When these effects and activities are purely objective (and under
that word I place all events and happenings going on in the three worlds of
human experience—the physical, astral and mental planes) you have
personality demonstration. When they are consciously related to the world
of causes and are the result of “right and conscious direction” of the
emanating centre, the soul, then the personality forces become subject to the
diffusion of the soul energies and the personality or form nature becomes
magnetic in a different manner, and so attracts to itself energies of a higher
and more dynamic plane to the ones with which the man has been concerned
hitherto and which he has learned to control and use; in other cases, the soul
energies intensify certain of the personality forces and the effect of the
exoteric planets is supplemented by an increasingly steady inflow of the
energies [141] of the esoteric planets, and these begin to have a dominantly
esoteric effect. In Capricorn, for instance, the influence of Saturn is both
exoteric and esoteric; in Taurus, Vulcan has both an esoteric and
hierarchical effect, whilst in Leo the Sun rules all three—the exoteric, the
esoteric and the hierarchical life. This we will study somewhat later in this
section and when we come to the consideration of the constellation Leo.
Planetary influences are unusually potent in Aquarius during this world
cycle because it is, in a peculiar way, a culminating sign for the majority of
people who proceed from Aries to Pisces upon the Fixed Cross. A rare few
consummate the experience of life upon the three Crosses in the sign Pisces,
and so become world saviours. They know then, and only then, the highest
aspect of the first ray as it expresses itself through the activity of Death. The
bulk, however, of the world initiates climax their experience in Aquarius and become liberated world servers. They turn their backs upon all further
progress for themselves in this cycle and on all satisfaction of their own
spiritual aspiration and become carriers of the water of life to humanity,
joining thus the ranks of the Hierarchy. Those who achieve in Pisces and
make the higher and further grade in their development pass into that centre
to which we have given the name of Shamballa, but the bulk of the initiates
and disciples remain attached to the second centre, that of the Hierarchy of
Service.
Aquarius is pre-eminently a sign of constant movement, of changing
activity and recurrent mutations, and the symbol for the sign is expressive of
this state of activity. It is, therefore, a sign in which the significance of
cycles is mastered and understood by the initiate. The results of the valley
experience (to use the well-known language of the mystics of all ages) and
of the mountain top with its vision [142] and light, are very vividly depicted
by the sign. The Aquarian can experience the depths of depression and of
self-depreciation or he can know and pass through the exaltation of the soul
and the sense of spiritual power which soul control gives, and know them to
be the interplay and the action and reaction which are necessary for growth
and comprehension. The law of such action and reaction is the law with
which he works.
In Leo, a man's centre and point of consciousness is himself; he turns upon
himself and revolves entirely upon his own axis and in respect and relation
to himself, and is all the time the self-centred individual, consecrating all
thought, time and service to his own well being and personal interests. But
in Aquarius, the polar opposite of Leo and its sign of consummation, he
becomes outgoing; there is no centre or circle of circumscribed influence
but only two outgoing lines of energy, pouring from him into the world of
men. The self-conscious individual in Leo becomes the conscious server in
Aquarius, and this is well expressed for us in the symbols of these two
signs. The Aquarian is consecrated to group service and to the welfare of
humanity. The average Aquarian upon the Mutable Cross will be, for
instance, a faithful employee, the adherent and worker in some firm or business within whose limits all his interests are confined and to whose
welfare all he has is consecrated. Upon the Fixed Cross this consecration to
others becomes world service.
Aquarius, we are told, governs the blood system and its circulation. By
means of the blood, the life force is distributed throughout the entire human
body. It is, therefore, symbolic of the task of the liberated Aquarian who
dispenses spiritual life throughout the fourth kingdom in nature. The
Aquarian influences are felt also as life-giving [143] in other forms of
planetary life and other kingdoms in nature but with these we will not deal
as we are confining our attention to humanity.
Aquarius, as you know, is one of the arms of the Fixed Cross. This Cross is
outstandingly the Cross of Discipleship and of the three major initiations in
connection with which it might be pointed out that:
1. In Taurus—Desire is transmuted into aspiration, darkness gives place
to light and illumination, the eye of the Bull is opened which is the
spiritual third eye, or the “single eye” of the New Testament. “If thine
eye be single,” said the Christ, “thy whole body shall be full of light.”
This single eye takes the place of the two eyes of the personal self.
The attention of the man becomes focussed upon spiritual attainment.
He treads the Path of Discipleship.
2. In Leo—The self-centred man becomes eventually the soul in life
expression and focussed on the achievement of the spiritual goal of
selflessness. In this sign, he undergoes preparation for the first
initiation and takes it also in this sign, or under this sign when it is the
rising sign, becoming “the Lion who seeks his prey,” that is the
personality who becomes the captive of the soul.
3. In Scorpio—In this sign, the disciple undergoes those tests which will
enable him to take the second initiation and demonstrate that the
desire nature is subdued and conquered and that the lower nature is
(by being lifted up in the air, i.e. into heaven) capable of reaching the
goal for this world period, and that from the earthy foundations of
Scorpio the personality can be so tested that it shows fitness for the world service demanded in Aquarius. This is beautifully expressed for
us in the [144] legend of Hercules, the Sun-God who overcomes the
nine-headed Hydra or serpent of desire by being forced to his knees
and from that position of humility lifts up the serpent into the air, and
then deliverance comes. Júpiter . In Aquarius—In this sign, the long effort of the soul is consummated
and concludes the experience of the disciple upon the Fixed Cross.
The man then takes the third initiation and becomes free from
personality control, taking the next two initiations upon the Cardinal
Cross.
I might here give you the following names for the three crosses taken from
the ancient archives and therefore difficult to translate:
1. The Mutable Cross—The Cross of changing and absorbed Experience.
This is the place of action and of reaction, of karmic control and of
response to impacts leading to the awakening of consciousness to the
nature of the goal ahead.
2. The Fixed Cross—The Cross of Transmutation. Desire becomes
aspiration, and selfishness is transformed into selflessness.
3. The Cardinal Cross—The Cross of Transcendence. Personality life
and form life and planetary life no longer control. The man stands
free.
Substance, the ocean of life, water, the symbol of desire and the impulse to
incarnate are transmuted into soul light and light substance and the urge to
tread consciously the path of return, plus the longing to serve. Desire is
developed and focussed in Taurus when the man is upon the Mutable Cross
and progressing around the zodiac. It is reoriented and repolarised in Taurus
when the man has mounted the [145] Fixed Cross and is eventually
relinquished in that sign. In the polar opposite of Taurus, Scorpio, the
personality is humbled and brought to grips with the soul; in that sign the
personality is “occultly killed and then resurrected into air and light,” in
order to become from that moment the servant of the soul. In Leo, the individual awakens to his own identity, concentrates his purpose, learns the
lessons and uses of selfishness (for that is one of the best ways to learn and
to discover that it is contrary to the laws of the soul) and is eventually so
cornered by the life processes that he becomes aware of the futility of selfinterest. In Aquarius, the man awakens to the beauty of group life, group
interest and his individual responsibility towards the group and begins to
live his life and to spend himself in the service of humanity.
In connection with the question of consciousness, students would find it
illuminating to study the subject along the following lines:
1. Subjective latent consciousness . . . . . . . . In Aries
2. The consciousness of duality . . . . . . . . . In Gemini
3. Mass consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In Cancer Júpiter . Individual self-consciousness . . . . . . . . . .In Leo
5. Equilibrised consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . In Libra
6. Group consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In Aquarius
The distinction between exoteric and esoteric astrology lies in just such
recognitions as listed above. Exoteric astrology deals with the
characteristics and qualities of the personality and of the form aspects, and
also with the events, happenings, circumstances and the conditioning
environment which appear in the personal horoscope, indicative of planetary
control and not of solar control. Esoteric astrology concerns itself primarily
with the unfoldment of consciousness, [146] with the impacts which
awaken it to the peculiar “gifts” of any particular sign and ray endowment
and with the reaction of the man and his consequent enrichment through his
response to the influence of a sign, working through the esoteric planets
from the angle of humanitarian awareness, of discipleship and of initiation.
This deals basically with his experiences from the angle of the three
Crosses, which involves first, mutation, then direction, and finally initiation.
Increasingly, these three Crosses will take a prominent place in astrological
delineation. We come now to a very interesting point in connection with Aquarius. There
is apparently no planet which is either exalted or “falls” in this sign. The
only planet affected is the Sun, whose power is lessened. What is the
symbolic significance of this? It consists in the relation of Aquarius to
Capricorn and of the Fixed Cross to the Cardinal Cross and of the third
initiation to those succeeding it, of the point of balance reached between
Pisces and Capricorn, which focus in Aquarius. I am not here considering
the orthodox mathematical or astronomical reasons, for they are, in reality,
dependent upon the subjective and spiritual reasons, and it is with these that
we are concerned. One of the facts which will emerge in our consciousness
as we study along these esoteric lines is that all the outer indications do not
indicate truth but only point the way to the subjective realities of which the
outer facts are but the illusory symbols. Ponder upon this and keep an open
mind.
No planet is exalted in Aquarius and no planet falls in this sign because the
true Aquarian—after due experience upon the Mutable Cross and the Fixed
Cross—has reached a point of balance. He is held by none of the pairs of
opposites but uses them both for spiritual ends. He is hindered neither by
earth nor water (Capricorn and Pisces); [147] he has surmounted the tests of
both the processes of incarnation and initiation and so stands free,
distributing energy and life, symbolised by the two wavy lines. It is
interesting to bear in mind that in the progress of the soul, as far as
humanity is concerned , one of the four signs of each Cross is of more
importance than the others. Each sign of each of the three Crosses is related
to one of the four kingdoms in nature and the preponderance of the ray
influence pours through the sign to the kingdom under consideration. In
connection with humanity, the sign of importance on the three Crosses is as
follows:
1. The Mutable Cross . . . . . . . . . . Pisces
2. The Fixed Cross . . . . . . . . . . . . Scorpio
3. The Cardinal Cross . . . . . . . . . . Capricorn In Aquarius, the initiate consummates all that has been achieved in Leo
through the influence of the Sun, for in Leo there is an almost unique
condition where humanity is concerned as the Sun governs all expressions
—exoteric, esoteric and hierarchical. It rules the personality, the soul and
the fourth Creative Hierarchy. Hence the Sun (the physical Sun) is lessened
in its power in Aquarius. The third initiation has been undergone and the
light of the personality has been “put out” or dimmed by the light of the
subjective Sun, influencing the soul. There is much to think out here but
little more can be directly indicated, as the curious fact of this triple control
by a planet constitutes one of the mysteries of initiation. It is tied up with
the relation between Leo and Aquarius, for Leo is unusual in having all its
ruling influences concentrated through the medium of one planet. Leo
indicates the height of achievement of the human soul. We are apt to think
that initiation and liberation are the achievement of the human kingdom
[148] and the attainment of humanity. This is not the case. Initiation is an
achievement and an attained success of the soul which has at last succeeded
in dominating the personality and in manifesting its true nature and
character, in spite of the personality and the antagonism of the human being
intent upon his own purposes. It is literally the attainment of certain desired
objectives, towards which the units of the fifth kingdom in nature have been
working for aeons, and expresses the end of the enforced task and sacrifice
and planetary service. This achievement reaches its goal at the third
initiation and from that time on man, liberated and free, serves from free
choice and as a soul, conscious of intent and purpose upon the physical
plane.
The decanates in Aquarius are governed (according to Alan Leo) by Saturn,
Mercury and Venus, and the effect that they will produce upon human
affairs and world conditions is already beginning to appear. Saturn is the
planet of discipleship and of opportunity; it is exceedingly active today,
presenting to the world disciple those difficult situations and crises which
will involve free choice, discriminative pioneering, wise response and
correct decision, thus bringing about the destruction of that which hinders
without the relinquishing of any true values of which humanity may be aware. The individual disciple has always been faced with these
conditioning and releasing circumstances, and today humanity itself is in the
same position. We stand at the gateway of the new world, of the new age
and its new civilizations, ideals and culture.
Saturn, having offered opportunity and proffered us a choice to bring about
the needed changes and to destroy that which holds back the free expression
of the soul, eventually stands aside in order to let His great Brother,
Mercury, spread the light of the soul—intuitive and illuminating—[149]
upon the situation, to interpret for us, through our own illumined minds, the
significance of events and to relate the old and the new, the past and the
future through the light of the present.
Hence, the subjective usefulness of the present general trend towards
meditation processes which bring about the capacity to be “impressed from
on high” (technically understood) and to be illumined by the light of the
soul.
When the task of Saturn and of Mercury has been accomplished, then during
the third decanate, Venus, which is the union of heart and mind, will usher
in the long hoped for era of love-wisdom, of brotherhood and of expressed
brotherly relationships. Opportunity— Illumination—Brotherhood: these
are the gifts that Shamballa is planning to confer upon mankind during the
Aquarian Age, if man will but prepare for them, accept them, and use them.
Only the future will make clear man's reaction.
According to other astrologers, the three decanates are governed by Venus,
Mercury and the Moon. You can here see the relation of astrology to the
normal or to the reversed wheel of life. The Moon which here takes the
place of Saturn hides the planet Uranus. In this case Uranus, the occult
planet, stands for exoteric science which penetrates into the hidden side of
form life, and thus we have the period wherein man is not alert enough or
conscious enough to seize upon opportunity and turn it to esoteric or soul
ends, but can identify himself with the more advanced aspects of form. The
energy which produces opportunity, illumination, and brotherly love as expressed and attained upon the Fixed Cross, demonstrates upon the
Mutable or Common Cross as difficulty, the versatile and volatile mind
(unstable and dark) and as sex.
This appears clearly in the words spoken to the man [150] upon the Mutable
Cross as he passes through an Aquarian cycle. The words are: “And the
Word said, Let desire in form be ruler,” for desire becomes gained
knowledge and the knowledge of that which is hidden at any stage upon the
path of evolution relates the individual to Uranus. When the man is upon the
Fixed Cross, the words come forth: “Water of life am I, poured forth for
thirsty men.” The implications are so clear that there is no need for me to be
more explicit or to elaborate the theme.
We shall next consider Capricorn at some length. These three studies of
Pisces, Aquarius and Capricorn will be slightly longer than the succeeding
ones as I have been laying the foundation of what I have to say under our
fifth point: The Three Crosses. We shall have brought out certain
considerations in connection with them that will be of value; Pisces is part
of the Mutable Cross, Aquarius of the Fixed Cross, and Capricorn of the
Cardinal Cross, and there will, therefore, be no need to repeat in such detail
what I have here said when we are dealing with the other signs. These three
signs are beginning signs or final signs, according to the state of the wheel
of life. They also sum up or initiate the activities of the other nine signs
which are fundamentally strictly human signs and synthesise the results of
experience upon the three Crosses.
We shall be able now to cover our present thesis anent the philosophical
implications of the Great Wheel of the Zodiac far more rapidly, as I can now
leave what else remains to be said in connection with the three Crosses until
I come to that part of our Section VI. There I shall have much of interest to
point out. I have dealt with these three Crosses at some length whilst we
were covering these first three signs of the zodiacal wheel as it revolves
from Aries, through Pisces, to Taurus. Each of these three is found on [151]
one of the Crosses and thus in themselves and in their relationship they
constitute a complete unit. It is interesting to note how these three signs are either those of commencement (upon the Mutable Cross) or of
consummation (upon the Fixed Cross). In the case where they stand for
beginning we have:
1. Aries . . . 1st Aspect . . Movement outward into incarnation.
..
..

The Will to manifest. Experience upon the Cardinal Cross.
2. Pisces . . 2nd Aspect . Desire for form existence. The Love or desire

for material things. Constant mutation. Experience upon the Mutable or
Common Cross.
3. Aquarius 3rd Aspect . . Consecration to the service of the lower

self. Selfishness. Experience upon the Fixed Cross. When these three signs form the end of the cycle of expression upon the
reversed wheel, then you have:

Culmination of experience upon the Mutable Cross.
3. Aries . 1st Aspect Appearance of the will to cooperate with

expressed. the Plan. The death of Self-will. Culmination of experience upon the Cardinal
Cross. The same basic mode of considering the three Crosses can be carried out
with Gemini, Taurus, Aries or the reverse: Aries, Taurus and Gemini,
remembering always that the Mutable Cross governs the wheel in ordinary
progress and the Fixed Cross governs it on the reversed progress during
discipleship. The Cardinal Cross in reality governs [152] both processes but
this is only understood when initiation has taken place.
1. Aries—Governs the Path of Discipleship. The Will to return to the
Source. Determination to achieve liberation. The emanating cause of the changes upon the Mutable and Fixed Crosses.
2. Taurus—The desire to overcome desire. The longing for liberation.
Transmutation of desire into Love.
3. Gemini—The fusion of the opposites; the intelligent work of at-onement; synthesis.
Upon the ordinary wheel, these signs bring about:
1. Gemini—Experience of the pairs of opposites. Pronounced and
separative duality. The interplay between the Twins: Soul and form
natures.
2. Taurus—The refocussing of the lower desires prior to another circling
of the Great Wheel in search of personality satisfaction. The Prodigal
Son journeys into a far country.
3. Aries—Again the beginning as well as the end.
It should be remembered that Aries is definitely that divine manifestation to
which Christ referred when He said “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the end.” The significance of this can, however, only be grasped when
the experiences of the Mutable Cross and of the Fixed Cross have been
transcended and the Cardinal Cross has been consciously mounted after the
third initiation. This is the “wheel which turns upon itself and rolls from
north to south and then from east to west as it progresses onward and, in one
moment of time, this it does.” This is a symbolic way of expressing the
united activity of all the states of consciousness, achieved upon the first two
wheels, and which [153] life experience, in many rounds of the zodiac, has
brought to the initiate; it means likewise that type of awareness which
transcends even that of the Christ Himself and for which He and the Buddha
are undergoing preparation. The experience of the Cardinal Cross
(concerning as it does cosmic unfoldment) transcends all possible
awareness, gained upon the other two Crosses and for which they have
prepared the initiate. It might be stated that
1. The Mutable Cross, in due time and when its lessons are assimilated,
brings about planetary awareness. 2. The Fixed Cross brings about systemic awareness.
3. The Cardinal Cross brings about cosmic awareness. CAPRICORN, THE GOAT
This is one of the most difficult signs about which to write, for it, as you
know, is the most mysterious sign of all the twelve. It is the sign of the Goat
which seeks its sustenance in the most rocky and arid of the world's places
and it, therefore, relates man to the mineral kingdom; it is also the sign of
the Crocodiles which live half in the water and half on dry land; it is
spiritually the sign of the Unicorn which is the “fighting and triumphant
creature” of the ancient myths. Under the symbolism of the above creatures,
this sign gives us a rather complete picture of man with his feet upon the
earth, yet running free and climbing to the heights of worldly ambition or of
spiritual aspiration in search of what he realises (at any particular time) to be
his major need. As the Goat, he is man, the earthly, human, greedy seeker
after the satisfaction of desire, or man, the equally selfish aspirant hunting
for the satisfaction of his aspiration. This sign portrays to us man, an
ambitious animal in two senses of the word: in the early stage upon [154]
the Mutable Cross, man, the blend of desire (water) and the animal nature
(earth), and upon the reversed wheel, man, the blend of soul and form. It
gives us the picture also of the triumphant initiate, the “unicorn of God,” the
symbol of the unicorn, with its one horn out-thrust like a single spear upon
his brow instead of the two horns of the scavenging goat.
It is interesting to study the three signs in which the animals have horns:
Aries , the downturned horns of the ram, signifying the coming into
manifestation, the involutionary cycle and the experience of the Cardinal
Cross as it expresses the Will-to-manifest of God. Taurus , the up-turned
horns of the Bull with the circle below, depicting the push of man, the Bull
of God, towards the goal of illumination and the emergence of the soul from
bondage with the two horns (duality) protecting the “eye of light” in the
centre of the Bull's forehead; this is “the single eye” of the New Testament
which makes the “whole body to be full of light.” Then Capricorn , the Goat, related particularly and closely to Aries, but hiding (as an esoteric
blind) the symbolism of the Unicorn in which the two horns and the single
eye are blended and depicted by the long straight horn of the unicorn in the
centre of the forehead.
Behind all the above lies the dual mystery of Leo, for Leo is—as far as
humanity is concerned—the key or clue to the entire zodiac and around the
constellation Leo two great mysteries are found:
1. The mystery of the Sphinx , connected with the relation of Leo and
Virgo, and tied up with the secret of the solar Angels. This is not the
mystery of soul and form, but the mystery of the higher and the lower
mind and their relation to each other. [155]
2. The Mystery of the Lion and the Unicorn . This secret is preserved for
us in the ancient nursery rhyme about the “lion and the unicorn going
up to town,” and contains in a peculiar way the secret of initiation and
the “going up” of the human being to the portal of admittance into the
Hierarchy as well as the “mystic raising” of which Masonry holds the
key. This deals with the emergence of the consciousness of the initiate
(white and one-pointed) and the defeat of the king of beasts (the
personality) leading to the triumph of group and world consciousness,
of selflessness and illumination over self-consciousness and
selfishness. In the true rendition of this ancient myth the king of
beasts is blinded and killed by the piercing of his eye and heart by the
long horn of the unicorn.
The symbol of this sign is indecipherable and intentionally so. It is
sometimes called the “signature of God.” I must not attempt to interpret it
for you, partly because it has never yet been correctly drawn and partly
because its correct delineation and the ability of the initiate to depict it
produces an inflow of force which would not be desirable, except after due
preparation and understanding. It is far more potent than the pentagon and
leaves the initiate “unprotected.” In an ancient astrological treatise which has never yet seen the light of day
but which will be some day discovered when the right time has arrived, the
relation between the horned animals of the zodiac is thus described:
“The Ram, the Scapegoat and the sacred Goat are Three in One and
One in Three. The Ram becomes the second and the second is the third.
The Ram that breeds and fertilises all; the Scapegoat, in [156] the
wilderness, redeems that all; the sacred Goat that merges in the Unicorn
and lifts impaled upon his golden horn the vanquished form—in these the
mystery lies hid.”
It here becomes apparent that three mysteries are hidden in the three horned
signs:
1. The mystery of God the Father . . . . . . . . . .Creation
2. The mystery of God the Son . . . . . . . . . . . .Redemption
3. The mystery of God the Holy Spirit . . . . . .Liberation
It might also be pointed out here that it is the will of the Father aspect,
manifesting through Aries, that governs Shamballa; the loving desire of the
Son which attracts to the Hierarchy; and the permeating, intelligent activity
of the Holy Spirit which animates that centre of divine life which we call
humanity. Therefore we have:
Shamballa . . . . . . .Hierarchy . . . . . . . . Humanity
Will . . . . . . . . . . . Love . . . . . . . . . . . .Intelligence
Aries . . . . . . . . . . Taurus . . . . . . . . . . Capricorn
In both their higher and their lower aspects these signs hold the secret of the
“horns of strife and the horn of plenty subjected to and guarded by the horn
of life.” Again, an ancient proverb runs: “The Ram—when it has become
the Scapegoat, has sought illumination as the Bull of God and has climbed
the mountain top in the semblance of the Goat—changes its shape into the
Unicorn. Great is the hidden key.” If the symbolism is carried a little further,
it might be stated that: 1. The Ram leads us into the creative life of Earth and into the darkness
of matter. This is the blue of midnight. [157]
2. The Bull leads into the places of desire in search of “wrathful
satisfaction.” This is the red of greed and anger, changing eventually
into the golden light of illumination.
3. The Goat leads us into arid ways in search of food and water. This is
the “need for green,” but the Goat is equal also to climbing to the
mountain top.
This is the experience of the Mutable Cross in connection with these three
signs. Upon the Fixed Cross:
1. Eventually the Ram becomes the Scapegoat and the will of God in
love and salvage is demonstrated.
2. The Bull becomes the bestower of light, and the darkness of the earlier
cycle is lightened by the Bull.
3. The Goat becomes the Unicorn, and leads to victory. The Crocodile,
the Goat and the Unicorn depict three stages of man's unfoldment.
Aries, Taurus, and Capricorn are the great transformers under the great
creative plan. They are in the nature of catalysts. Each of them opens a door
into one of the three divine centres of expression which are the symbols in
the body of the planetary Logos of the three higher centres in man: the head,
the heart and the throat.
Aries opens the door into Shamballa, when the experience of Taurus and
Capricorn has been undergone.
Taurus opens the door into the Hierarchy when the significance of
Gemini and Leo is understood and the first two initiations can
therefore he taken.
Capricorn opens the door into the Hierarchy in a higher aspect when the
last three initiations can be undergone and the significance of Scorpio
and of Virgo is understood. [158] In these signs and their relationship upon the Fixed Cross lies hid the
mystery of Makara and of the Crocodiles.
The keynotes of this sign are all indicative of a crystallisation process. This
concretising faculty of Capricorn can be considered in several ways.
First of all, Capricorn is an earth sign, and in it we have expressed the
densest point of concrete materialisation of which the human soul is
capable. Man is then “of the earth, earthy” and is what the New Testament
calls “the first Adam.” In this sense, Capricorn holds in itself the seeds of
death and finality—the death which takes place finally and eventually in
Pisces. Ponder on this. When crystallisation has reached a certain degree of
density and so-called “hardness,” it is easily shattered and destroyed and
man, born in Capricorn, then brings about his own destruction; this is due to
his fundamentally materialistic nature, plus the “blows of fate” which are
the enactments of the law of karma. Again and again, a certain measure of
concreteness is achieved, only again to undergo destruction, prior to the
release of the life and the rebuilding of the form.
Secondly, Capricorn is ever the sign of conclusion, and of this the mountain
top is frequently (though not always) the symbol, for it marks the point
beyond which further ascent in any particular life cycle is not possible.
Capricorn is, therefore, the sign of what has been called esoterically
“periodic arresting.” Progress becomes impossible under the existing forms,
and there has to be the descent into the valley of pain, despair and death
before a fresh attempt to scale the heights takes place. The attempt today to
climb Mount Everest is amazingly symbolic, and it is being watched with
much interest by the Hierarchy, for in this effort we see the attempt of
humanity to achieve the top of [159] the mountain whose height has
hitherto defeated all efforts. But—and this is the matter of moment and of
interest—when humanity emerges into the light and relative glory of the
new civilisation, they will at the same time conquer this last remaining
summit. That which is of the densest materiality and which is the
consummation of earthly grandeur will remain—but it will be beneath the
feet of humanity. Thirdly, Capricorn is, as a consequence of all the above, the sign in which is
inaugurated a new cycle of effort, whether this effort is in connection with
the individual man or with the initiate. Effort, strain, struggle, the fight with
the forces native to the underworld, or the strenuous conditions entailed by
the tests of discipleship or initiation—these are distinctive of experience in
Capricorn.
In ancient days, as you may perchance have heard, there were only ten
signs, and—at that time—Capricorn marked the end of the zodiacal wheel,
and not Pisces as is at this time the case. The two signs of Aquarius and
Pisces were not incorporated in the signs for the simple and sufficient
reason that humanity could not respond to their peculiar influences; the
vehicles of contact and the mechanisms for responses were not adequately
developed. Originally, there were eight signs; then there were ten and now
twelve.
1. In Lemurian days, during the early period of animal man and before
humanity appeared on earth, in the interim period of development, eight
signs influenced the planet and the kingdoms of nature found upon it. There
was no response to the influences of Leo and Virgo . The mystery of the
Sphinx did not exist and these two signs were not then part of the zodiacal
wheel. Then individualisation took place and the seed of Christhood [160]
was planted in man and these two signs began to influence humanity, and
gradually that influence was recognised and the zodiac was then known to
have ten signs. The Mutable Cross dominated, but it was then the Tau, for
Pisces was lacking and only Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius were evidenced.
Aries to Capricorn marked the circle of experience.
2. In Atlantean days, man had become so responsive to the planetary and
solar influence that the door of initiation into hierarchical experience was
opened and two more signs were added. These two signs were the higher
correspondences of Leo and Virgo and were the polar opposites of these
two: Aquarius and Pisces. Their influence became active and effective and
thus they formed part of the zodiacal wheel because man began to respond
to their potencies. It then became possible for the Fixed Cross to function esoterically in the life of humanity, and the first reversals of the wheel in the
life of the advanced men of the period took place. It was this reversal which
was the true cause of the great contest or battle between the Lords of the
Dark Face (as they are called in The Secret Doctrine ) and the Lords of
Light—a contest which is today persisting. Certain men then reached the
stage of discipleship wherein they could consciously mount the Fixed Cross
and be prepared for a major initiation. This the Forces of Materiality and of
Obstruction (as they are sometimes called) fought and the battle was fought
out and conditioned in the sign Scorpio.
3. Today, in Aryan times, a similar conflict upon a higher turn of the spiral
is taking place. The reason is that certain world disciples and initiates have
reached the point in their unfoldment wherein they are ready to [161] mount
the Cardinal Cross and take some of the higher initiations. So the conflict is
on between humanity (under the control of the Lords of Materiality) and the
Hierarchy (under the control of the Forces of Light and Love), and right
before our eyes the battle is being waged. The influences of the twelve signs
of the zodiac (particularly of seven of the signs) are being engaged, for
today men of all types and rays are responsive to their influences and are
implicated in some form or another in the affair.
You will note, therefore, that if the concentrated forces of the Cardinal Cross
are definitely potent at this time (as they are) the battle is terrific, because,
1. Humanity, as a whole, is in a state of turmoil, prior to a great step forward
in self-conscious unfoldment, and in the expression of the sense of
responsibility which is the first flower and fruit of self-conscious awareness.
This fact is responsible for sweeping into the conflict in a peculiar and
pronounced manner, the forces of Cancer (involutionary in nature), of Leo
(concerned with individualisation), and of Gemini (expressive of man's
essential duality). You find, therefore, today, the activity of the mass
consciousness of Cancer which is indicative of the activity of the Cardinal
Cross in the involutionary stage; the self-consciousness of man as indicated
by Leo, the most human sign of all, and indicative of the Fixed Cross; and
Gemini, which gives the sense of the dual nature of man —human and divine—which is the goal of the consciousness of experience upon the
Mutable Cross. You consequently have a sign in each of the three Crosses
particularly active today in influencing the masses of men everywhere. A
little [162] study of world conditions, as far as man is concerned, will prove
this.
2. The disciples of the world today and advanced humanity are equally in a
state of turmoil. They are being tested and tried, prior to taking a major step
forward—in some cases this will be the taking of the first initiation and in
others the second. This is brought about by, and brings in, the forces of
Taurus, Leo and Scorpio, plus a general pervasive influence coming from
Gemini. You have here three signs found in the Fixed Cross and one in the
Mutable Cross conditioning and affecting the world disciples, and all of
them of terrific importance and potency today, owing to the stage of
development and the sensitivity of the disciples and world initiates.
3. The initiates, in their turn, are being subjected to the impact of energies
from Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces—an inflow of force from each of the
three Crosses. These three forces enable the initiates to take the third
initiation.
It will interest you to note that average humanity is, therefore, subjected to
the influences of three major signs at this time and conditioned by potencies
coming from each of the three Crosses. These present men with the
responsibility of choice, evoking their free will, their trend towards selfdetermination and their established decision at this time of world crisis. You
will note that the world disciples are related to the mass of men through
their responsiveness to influences emanating from Gemini, and to each other
through Scorpio. This produces in them the capacity to respond to test, to a
sense of the vision (through the illumined eye of Taurus) and to use their
power of individuality [163] through a developed personality and through
the potency of Leo. Initiates are brought into relation to the world disciples
through the constellation Scorpio, to the hierarchical centre through
Capricorn, and to the mass through Pisces, the sign of all world saviours. Seven constellations are, therefore, predominantly brought into a close
combination at the present moment of crisis and are responsible for world
affairs as they are found today:
Cancer . . . . . .
Capricorn . . .
Taurus . . . . . .
Leo . . . . . . . .
Scorpio . . . . .
Gemini . . . . .
Pisces . . . . . . The Cardinal Cross. “Both Gates stand wide.” The Fixed Cross. “The Disciples dominate the world.” The Mutable Cross. “World salvation is possible today.” The exoteric and the esoteric planetary rulers of Capricorn are the same, and
Saturn rules the career of the man in this sign, no matter whether he is on
the ordinary or the reversed wheel, or whether he is on the Mutable or the
Fixed Cross. When he has taken the third initiation and can consciously
mount the Cardinal Cross, he is then released from the ruling of Saturn and
comes under the influence of Venus, who is governor or ruler of the
Hierarchy which is that of the Crocodiles. A reference to the tabulation
heretofore given will show this. It is only when a man is upon the Cardinal
Cross that the significance, purpose and potencies of the Creative
Hierarchies become clear to [164] him and the “doors of entrance” into all
of them stand wide open. On the Mutable Cross and on the Fixed Cross we
have the so-called green ray, controlling not only the daily life of karmic
liability upon the path of evolution, but also controlling the experiences and
processes of evolution. The reason for this is that Capricorn is an earth sign
and because the third and fifth rays work pre-eminently through this sign,
embodying the third major aspect of divinity, active intelligence plus that of
its subsidiary power, the fifth Ray of Mind. These pour through Capricorn to
Saturn and to Venus and so reach our planet, the Earth. Saturn is one of the
most potent of the four Lords of Karma and forces man to face up to the
past, and in the present to prepare for the future. Such is the intention and
purpose of karmic opportunity. From certain angles, Saturn can be regarded
as the planetary Dweller on the Threshold, for humanity as a whole has to
face that Dweller as well as the Angel of the Presence, and in so doing discover that both the Dweller and the Angel are that complex duality which
is the human family. Saturn, in a peculiar relation to the sign Gemini, makes
this possible. Individual man makes this discovery and faces the two
extremes whilst in the sign Capricorn; the fourth and fifth Creative
Hierarchies do the same thing in Libra.
Through Saturn and Venus, therefore, Capricorn is connected with Libra and
also with Gemini and Taurus, and these four constellations—Taurus,
Gemini, Libra and Capricorn—constitute a potent quaternary of energies
and between them produce those conditions and situations which will enable
the initiate to demonstrate his readiness and capacity for initiation. They are
called the “Guardians of the Four Secrets.” [165]
Taurus —Guards the secret of light and confers illumination upon the
initiate.
Gemini —Guards the mystery or secret of duality and presents the
initiate with a word which leads to the fusion of the greater pairs of
opposite.
Libra —Guards the secret of balance, of equilibrium and finally speaks
the word which releases the initiate from the power of the Lords of
Karma.
Capricorn —Guards the secret of the soul itself and this it reveals to the
initiate at the time of the third initiation. This is sometimes called the
“secret of the hidden glory.”
Through certain other of the planetary rulers, through the medium of which
the third and fifth rays work, Capricorn is connected with other
constellations besides the four above mentioned, but these four are for our
purposes the most important. Students can work out the remaining
interlocking energies for themselves, if they so desire, by relating the rays,
planetary rulers and constellations through reference to the tabulations
already given. The subject is, however, definitely confusing to the beginner,
and it is for this reason that I am dealing here with the philosophy and symbolism of the signs first of all, so as to familiarise the student with the
general scheme and the universal broad interlocking.
The third and fifth rays are peculiarly active upon the Path of Discipleship,
just as the sixth and fourth are dominant upon the Path of Evolution and the
first and seventh upon the Path of Initiation. The second ray controls and
dominates all the other rays, as you well know. [166].

Pluto. Aries. Gemini. Cancer. Virgo. Scorpio.

Taurus. Libra. Pisces. You will notice from the above tabulation one or two interesting points.
These should be carefully considered by all astrologers after determining the
approximate place of the subject upon the evolutionary path in one or other
of its three divisions. First, that the constellation Gemini appears twice on
account of its close connection with the fourth Creative Hierarchy. Second,
that during the period of the Mutable Cross five constellations are concerned
with the experience of man upon the path of daily life, of constant rebirths
and of karmic difficulty. Four of them lead to Scorpio, in which sign comes
the point of the reversal of the Wheel.
Third, that on the Path of Discipleship three constellations control and lead
up to the activity of Capricorn, at which time initiation becomes possible.
Fourth, on the Path of Initiation the activity of all the three Crosses is felt
simultaneously through the medium of the “released powers” of Taurus,
Libra and Pisces. You will note also that the first ray influence, expressing
through Pluto and Vulcan, is only felt in a positive manner upon the Path of
Discipleship. This first ray potency has only lately been experienced by
humanity as a whole as it neared the stage of being the world disciple, and
vast numbers relatively stood upon the Path of Discipleship and Probation.
Hence the recent discovery of Pluto and the sensed power of Vulcan, veiled
by the potency of Mercury and hidden behind the planet. [167] Second ray influences and potencies are abidingly present and pour
into our planetary sphere and life, via the Sun (veiling a hidden planet) and
Jupiter. These sweep the forces of Leo, Sagittarius, Pisces, Aquarius and
Virgo into and through our entire planet and all its kingdoms in nature.
From the above few points, hints can be gathered together as to the
interlocking forces of all the twelve constellations, as they pour into and
through all the kingdoms in nature, carrying with them also not only their
own individual potencies but also those of the seven rays, focussed through
the sacred and non-sacred planets—the discovered and undiscovered
planetary Lives. It has been occultly said that a vision of these powers and
their many weaving lines (seen as rivers and streams of light) is given to the
initiate from the mountain top of Capricorn, once that summit has been
reached. It is at the Transfiguration initiation that this vision appears before
the eyes of the astounded disciple. The great experiences upon the various
mountain tops as related in the Bible have all to do with Capricorn. Moses,
the Lawgiver on Mount Sinai, is Saturn in Capricorn imposing the law of
karma upon the people. A clue to the significance of the Jewish people as a
karmic clearing house can be found here. Ponder on those words “a karmic
clearing house.” The Mount of Transfiguration in the New Testament is
Venus in Capricorn when love and mind and will meet in the person of the
Christ, and “He was transfigured” before all men. At the same time, He
received the vision of the Father and of what He had to do as He “went up to
Jerusalem,” the place of death and likewise the city of peace. This Jerusalem
is Pisces. In Aquarius, Christ put His disciples in touch with the “man,
bearing a pitcher of water,” Aquarius, and in the upper room introduced
them to union and unity under the symbolism of the [168] communion
feast. For that feast, humanity is today preparing, as we saw when studying
the last constellation. The astrological significance of the New Testament is
as yet little understood. Christ was born in Capricorn, fulfilled the law under
Saturn, initiated the era of intelligent brotherhood under Venus and is the
perfect example of the Capricornian initiate who becomes the world Server
in Aquarius, and the world Saviour in Pisces, thus completing the round of
the zodiac and able to say triumphantly in Pisces “It is finished.” The polar opposite to Capricorn is Cancer and, as you have been taught,
these two signs are the two great Gates of the zodiac—one opening the door
into incarnation, into mass life, and into human experience, whilst the other
opens the door into the life of the spirit, into the life of the Kingdom of God,
the life and purposes of the Hierarchy of our planet. Cancer admits the soul
into the world centre which we call Humanity. Capricorn admits the soul
into conscious participation in the life of that world centre which we call the
Hierarchy. Libra admits the soul into the world centre which we call
Shamballa, for it is the polar opposite of Aries which is the place of
beginnings. Libra demonstrates the perfect balance of spirit and matter
which first came together in Aries. This balance and this relation of the
great opposites, spirit and matter, is symbolised for us in the personality
situation of balancing the pairs of opposites on the astral plane, and finding
between them the “narrow razor-edged path” which leads the man into the
kingdom of the soul. As man passes around and around the zodiac in the
ordinary manner, he continually and consciously enters into life in Cancer,
the constellation under which the Law of Rebirth is applied and
administered. But it is only on the reversed zodiac that the man learns to
pass with [169] equally conscious purpose through the gate of Capricorn.
Five times he has to pass through that Gate in full waking consciousness
and these five happenings are frequently called the five major initiations.
Viewing the fourth Creative Hierarchy as a whole, the appearance and
experiences of the life of the planetary Logos through the medium of the
five races—two past, one present, the Aryan, and two to come—are
planetary correspondences to the five initiations. This is peculiarly
interesting to study because at the time that any particular race comes into
being both the doors in Cancer and Capricorn stand wide open, being then
occultly aligned.
A study of the characteristics and qualities of the man who is born in the
sign Capricorn will reveal a great deal anent the human family because the
Capricornian can express all the worst of which a man is capable and all the
best. It is a sign of extremes, and this because at the time there were only ten
signs, Capricorn was the first on the ordinary wheel and the last on the reversed wheel. This is obvious. Esoterically, all world Saviours and Sun
Gods are born in Capricorn but also the very worst type of man—hard,
materialistic, cruel, proud, selfishly ambitious and egoistic. The head rules
the heart in such cases, whereas in the perfect example of the influences of
Capricorn, head and heart are perfectly balanced.
Capricorn rules the knees and this is symbolically true, for only when the
Capricornian subject learns to kneel in all humility and with his knees upon
the rocky mountain top to offer his heart and life to the soul and to human
service, can he be permitted to pass through the door of initiation and be
entrusted with the secrets of life. Only on his knees can he go through that
door. As long as he arrogantly stands where he has not earned the right to
stand, he can [170] never safely be given the information which is imparted
to all true initiates. The ancient mode of pilgrimage in India, by which the
devotee passed or progressed from one holy place to another upon his knees,
is indicative of this deep need of the Capricornian for humility. India is
ruled by Capricorn and India knows this truth. Though India has permitted
the physical act to usurp the place of a spiritual attitude, yet the symbolic
meaning is eternally true. When the man born in Capricorn can kneel in
spirit and in truth, he is then ready for the initiatory process upon the
mountain top.
The symbolism underlying the astrological fact that Mars is exalted in
Capricorn, whilst the power of the Moon is lessened in that sign, and Jupiter
and Neptune both fall, is significantly beautiful and instructive. Mars is the
God of War, the Producer of conflicts, and in this earthly sign Mars
triumphs in the early stages of the evolution of the fourth Creative
Hierarchy and in the life history of the undeveloped and average man.
Materialism, the fight for the satisfaction of personal ambitions, and the
conflict with higher spiritual tendencies goes steadily forward, and this most
material of all the signs is the battleground of the old established order and
habits and the new and higher inclinations and tendencies. India, governed
by Capricorn, has been a battlefield right down the ages; Port Said, ruled by
this sign, is synonymous with the satisfaction of all the earthly and animal desires of the baser sort and is one of the wickedest cities in the world—a
meeting place for the evil of three continents.
But as evolution proceeds, the power of the Moon, which is the symbol and
ruler of form, grows less and less, and the man upon the reversed wheel is
steadily freeing himself from the control of matter. The attractive lure of that
[171] which is material wanes increasingly. Jupiter, which has been the
ruler of Pisces and also of Aquarius, falls in this sign. This fall must be
studied from two angles, for Jupiter in its lowest aspect gives the fulfilment
of desire and satisfied demand, whilst in its highest Jupiter is the outgoing
expression of love, which attracts magnetically to itself that which is desired
—this time the good of the whole. In Capricorn, therefore, Jupiter reaches
its lowest point of expression in the densest material aspect, and then—as
love and selflessness triumph—this lowest aspect vanishes and disappears.
It is to the “fall” of the highest aspect that the symbolism refers, and then
later to the fall or disappearance of all that is base and low. Love is fallen
and blinded when desire is rampant; desire vanishes when love triumphs.
Neptune is often spoken of as falling in this sign and for the same reasons.
Neptune is the God of the waters, and is esoterically related to Pisces. It
should be noted that both Neptune and Jupiter are exalted in Cancer, the
great sign wherein the desire for incarnation finds its fulfilment; the power
of both is lessened in Virgo, wherein the first signs of the Christ
consciousness are felt; both fall in Capricorn, when the Christ life and
consciousness come to full fruition. There is much, as you can see, to be
worked out along these three lines and the above suggestions will indicate
how a comparative study and a philosophical research can be fruitfully
made.
In Capricorn we have the triumph of matter; it reaches its densest and most
concrete expression; but this triumph is followed by that of spirit. There is
full expression of the earthly nature in Capricorn but also immense spiritual
possibilities. India, for instance, expresses a widespread degradation, but at
the same time the heights of spiritual attainment; a study of India—her history, characteristics [172] and spiritual qualities—will reveal much anent
the influences and possibilities of this sign.
The triplicity into which each sign is divided and which we call the
decanates is of particular interest in the case of Capricorn. As is the case in
all correspondence, this triplicity can be related to the three aspects of God
and man—spirit, soul and body. The central decanate is therefore of peculiar
moment in our world period as it is concerned with the effect of the
planetary influences, the solar rays and the energy of the constellations upon
the soul or the consciousness aspect. This is the case whether we are
considering man on the ordinary wheel or man upon the reversed wheel.
From the standpoint of astrological interpretation and in the case where the
astrologer is not sure which way the wheel is turning, it is the only decanate
with its ruler of which he can be sure. The influence of the ruler is,
therefore, inevitable. This is strikingly the case in connection with the sign
Aquarius into which sign our sun is now entering, its three decanates,
Saturn, Mercury and Venus, bringing inevitably difficulty, illumination and
brotherly love. On the ordinary wheel, in all outer affairs, Saturn controls,
and we consequently find ourselves today in a state of chaos and trouble,
but as far as the consciousness of the race is concerned, Mercury is
becoming increasingly active. A steady illumination is taking place and
light is being thrown on all problems—light on government and politics
through experiments and the study of great and basic ideologies; light on the
material nature of the world through all the many branches of science; light
on humanity itself through education, philosophy and psychology. This light
is spreading down to the very darkest places in our planet and its many
forms of life.
Two sets of rulers for the three decanates are available. [173] According to
Alan Leo, we have Saturn, Venus and Mercury. According to Sepharial we
have Jupiter, Mars and the Sun. Of these two, the first is the more correct
and the more esoteric. The true rulers are Saturn, Venus and the Sun. I
would remind you that Mercury and the Sun are interchangeable but that in this case the Sun stands exoterically for Mercury and esoterically for a
hidden planet.
Saturn relates Capricorn to the previous sign Aquarius, upon the ordinary
wheel, and Jupiter, exoterically understood, relates Capricorn to Sagittarius
upon the reversing wheel. It will be obvious to all esotericists that the Sun is
the obvious ruler of the third decanate, veiling as it does a hidden and
deeply significant planet and being that which reveals divinity at the time of
the third initiation. You will note how, in this great sign of initiation, Saturn
reveals the nature of the third aspect of divinity, the nature of intelligent
substance; Venus reveals the nature of the second aspect, which is
consciousness or intelligent love, whilst the Sun—the physical Sun and the
heart of the Sun together—reveals the synthesis of these two.
The key words upon the ordinary wheel are “And the Word said: Let
ambition rule and let the door stand wide.” Here we have the key to the
evolutionary urge, to the secret of rebirth, and of that word which
reverberates from Cancer to Capricorn. The door of initiation stands ever
open, but for aeons of time man prefers the open door in Cancer. Ambition
urges him on from life to life until he has discovered the worthlessness of all
earthly gratification. Gradually then spiritual ambition and a desire for
liberation take the place of worldly ambition, and become an impelling
impulse, until finally the moment arrives when a true sense of reality
supersedes both earthly and spiritual ambition. The man can then say with
truth “Lost am I in light supernal, [174] yet on that light I turn my back.”
For him there remains now no goal but service. He therefore passes back
through the gate of Cancer, but with his consciousness held steadily in the
sign Aquarius. From being the world initiate in Capricorn he becomes an
incarnated world server in Aquarius, and later a world saviour in Pisces. SAGITTARIUS, THE ARCHER
This sign is, as you know, a peculiarly human sign and is connected in a
definite manner with the appearance of humanity upon our Earth. There are
three of the zodiacal signs which are more closely connected with man than are any of the others. These are: Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius. In one
peculiar (but not yet provable) manner, they are related to the three aspects
of body, soul and spirit. The following tabulation or concise statement of
rather momentous implications may serve to make this clearer:

Liberation. I could continue to summarise the qualities and characteristics of these three
and their peculiar inter-relation but the above will suffice amply to
demonstrate the connection between them and their progressive effect upon
the subject [175] passing under their influence periodically and cyclically.
They are frequently referred to as the signs which—when studied—will
reveal divine intent in man, will mark the points of crisis in his progress and
will (when the three influences which they express have done their work)
carry the man “from door to door, for Leo is the next sign to Cancer, and
Sagittarius is the sign which precedes Capricorn.” I am quoting from an
ancient book on the signs.
Sagittarius is sometimes depicted as an archer on a white horse and a
study of the meaning of this symbolism will reveal a great deal of inner
teaching. This is one of the later ways of portraying this constellation.
Earlier, in Atlantean days (from which period we have inherited what we
know about astrology), the sign was frequently depicted by the Centaur— the fabulous animal which was half a man and half a horse. The horse
symbolism dominated Atlantean myths and symbols, just as the ram and
the lamb are prominently to be found in our modern presentations. This
earlier sign of the Centaur stood for the evolution and the development of
the human soul, with its human objectives, its selfishness, its
identification with form, its desire and its aspirations. The Archer on the
white horse, which is the more strictly Aryan symbol for this sign,
signifies the orientation of the man towards a definite goal. The man is
then not part of the horse but is freed from identification with it and is the
controlling factor. The definite goal of the Centaur, which is the
satisfaction of desire and animal incentives, becomes in the later stages
the goal of initiation, which meets with satisfaction in Capricorn, after the
preliminary work has been done in Sagittarius. The keynote of the
Centaur is ambition. The keynote of the Archer is aspiration and
direction, and both are expressions of human goals but one is of the
personality and the other of the soul. [176] From ambition to aspiration,
from selfishness to an intense desire for selflessness, from individual onepointed self-interest in Leo to the one-pointedness of the disciple in
Sagittarius and thence to initiation in Capricorn. It is interesting to note
that the astrological symbol for this sign currently used is simply the
arrow with a fragment of the bow depicted. The Archer as well as the
Centaur have dropped out of the picture and this is largely because the
emphasis or focus of human living today is not based upon the objective
outer facts of life upon the physical plane but upon some form of inner
focus or emphasis, which varies from the many stages of astral and
emotional ambition to spiritual aspiration, and from the activities of the
lower mind bent upon selfish interest to the illumination of the same mind
through focus upon the soul. An ancient catechism which all disciples
have to master, asks the following questions and supplies the needed
answers:
“Where is the animal, O Lanoo? and where the Man? Fused into one, O Master of my Life. The two are one. But both have
disappeared and naught remains but the deep fire of my desire.
Where is the horse, the white horse of the soul? Where is the rider of
that horse, O Lanoo?
Gone towards the gate, O Master of my Life. But something speeds
ahead between the pillars of an open door—something that I myself
have loosed.
And what remains to thee, O wise Lanoo, now that the horses of two
kinds have left thee and the rider, unattached, stands free? Now what
remains? [177]
Naught but my bow and arrow, O Master of my Life, but they suffice,
and, when the right time comes, I, thy Lanoo, will follow fast upon
the shaft I sent. The horses I will leave upon this side of the door,
for them I have no further need. I enter free, regain the arrow which
I sent and speed upon my way, passing from door to door, and each
time the arrow speeds ahead.”
It is for this reason that the keynotes of Sagittarius are five in number.
1. Attached or fused duality—the Centaur.
Unattached duality—the Archer.
Freedom or one-pointedness—the Bow and Arrow.
2. Human ambition leading eventually to spiritual aspiration.
3. A clear shaft of light which is the intuitive and focussed attitude of the
pledged disciple. Júpiter . The “returning arrow of the intuition,” as it is sometimes called. For it
is the shaft of the arrow of aspiration which returns to the sender as
the arrow of the intuition. Sagittarius is one of the intuitive signs, for
only the intuition will suffice to carry a man to the foot of the
mountain of initiation in Capricorn. 5. Idealism which is the power to see the vision and to direct one's course
towards it. This is the work of Mars, the expression of the sixth ray.
A study of the charts of the human family at all the different stages, from
the time of the Mutable Cross experience wherein the personality is built up,
constructed, developed and integrated, to the final crucifixion of the
personality [178] upon the Fixed Cross of the Heavens, will reveal that
every time the man finds himself under the influence of Sagittarius it is with
the objective of orienting himself to some new and higher objective, with
the task of refocussing himself towards a higher goal and with the
unfoldment of some basic and directing purpose. These developing purposes
may range all the way from purely animal desire, through selfish human
ambition, to the struggle of the aspiring disciple or initiate in order to
achieve the needed liberation towards which the entire evolutionary process
has impelled him. It is interesting, in this connection, to trace the unfolding
of the human consciousness through the influence of the energies let loose
through the various zodiacal signs:
1. Instinct, governing desire—Cancer. Mass unevolved consciousness.
I desire.
2. Intellect, governing ambition—Leo. Individual consciousness.
I know.
3. Intuition, governing aspiration—Sagittarius. Soul consciousness in
early stages. Initiation 1 and 2.
I vision. Júpiter . Illumination, governing intuition—Capricorn. Soul consciousness in
later stages.
I realise.
5. Inspiration, governing service—Aquarius. Group consciousness.
I go forth. [179]
6. Identification, governing liberation—Pisces. Divine consciousness. I and the Father are one.
In these signs—Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces—
you have the six signs which constitute the six pointed star of the human or
fourth Creative Hierarchy; Cancer and Pisces marking the two extremes.
The Crab symbolises imprisonment (the hard shell and the rocks under
which the Crab ever takes shelter), and the Fish signifies freedom. In
between—in Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius—come the four
stages of personality development, struggle with the pairs of opposites, and
finally release into full spiritual service. In connection with the development
of the intellect into the intuition and its consummation as the divine
aspiration of the personality (“inspired from on high,” as this stage is
technically called), the following ideas may be found useful; I am simply
hinting at them and am leaving the student to work out the various
implications for himself.
We have seen that Cancer is the sign of instinctual life, and that in Leo the
intellect or mind became part of the individual man's equipment. This
intellectual awareness is the result of a slow evolution of the instinctual
nature which, when it has reached a certain stage of development, came
under the direct influence of the Hierarchy of the planet in a new way, and
then—under the stimulation of energies from the planet Venus—a fusion
took place which resulted in the emergence of individual self-conscious
man. Gradually, as the aeons have slipped away, the instinctual nature has
receded steadily into the background or below the threshold of
consciousness, whilst the intellect has become more and more dominant and
an increasingly potent factor. In [180] Scorpio the mind is released into full
governing activity. This release takes place in two stages:
Stage 1—Wherein the intellect becomes dominant and powerful and
controls eventually the emotional nature.
Stage 2— Wherein the intellect is illumined by the light of the soul.
In dealing with probationary disciples and with ordinary humanity, the
servers of humanity would do well to remember these two stages and not confuse them as they attempt to aid those who are in one or other of them.
The emphasis is laid upon the struggle of the personality to release itself
from the grip of lower desire in the first case, and in the second to release
itself from surrounding world glamour which is revealed when soul light is
thrown into it, via the reflecting and illumined mind. In stage 1, the power
of the trained reasoning and rationalising mind is called into activity by the
soul; in the other, the illumination of the soul must pour into the mind and is
then reflected, like a searchlight, onto the astral plane.
This takes place upon the Probationary Path and is called the experience of
the disciple in the depths or the valleys .
In Sagittarius, the intellect which has been developed, used and finally
illumined, becomes sensitive to a still higher type of mental experience and
to this we give the name of intuitive perception. There come flashes of light
upon problems; a distant yet possible vision of attainment is seen; the man
begins to climb out of the depths to which he has descended in Scorpio and
sees ahead of him the mountain in Capricorn which he knows he must
eventually climb. He walks no longer in the dark, for he sees what he has to
do and he therefore makes rapid progress and travels “fast [181] upon the
Way.” He “flies from point to point, searching for the arrows which he has
discharged.” He has, figuratively speaking, to dismount constantly from his
white horse (the developed and purified personality) and find where the
arrows of intuitional aspiration will take him; he travels upon the “wings of
the soul” (note the relationship to the winged feet of Mercury, the messenger
of the Gods) and becomes, in his own personality, himself the winged God:
Mercury, as you know, governs Gemini, the polar opposite of Sagittarius.
This he does until he has established a balanced relationship between the
personality and the soul and can function as either at any desired moment
with equal facility.
This takes place upon the Path of Discipleship and is called the experience
of the disciple upon the plains of Earth, for the path between the pairs of
opposites runs straight and level, leaving the depths of personality experience and the heights of soul experience (at this point of development)
on either side.
In Capricorn, the initiate learns to realise the meaning of the growing light
which greets his progress as he climbs upward to the mountain top. The
flashes of intuition with which he is becoming familiar change into the
blazing and constant light of the soul, irradiating the mind and providing
that point of fusion which must ever be the “fusion of the two lights, the
greater and the lesser light” to which I referred in A Treatise on White Magic
. The light of the personality and the light of the soul blend. Upon this I
need not enlarge, as nothing I could say would be more than it now is—the
theory of initiation. This takes place upon the Path of Initiation and is called
the experience of the mountain top . All are needed—the depths, the plains
and the mountain top.
[182] As you know, Sagittarius is one of the four arms of the Mutable
Cross. An idea of the general symbology of this Cross, from the quality
angle, can be gained if we give the two sets of characteristics which
distinguish the man upon this Cross—both unevolved man and the aspirant
to divinity. We might list these as follows, finding for each arm a distinctive
phrase :
Unevolved man Evolved man Gemini—Changeableness. Instability. Interplay.
Sagittarius—Ambitious desire. Direction. Orientation.
Virgo—Material life. The cherishing of an idea.
Pisces—Sensation. Mediumship. Fluidity.
Gemini—Recognition of soul and form. Soul interplay.
Sagittarius—One-pointed spiritual aspiration. Disciples.
Virgo—The mother of the Christ Child. Gestation.
Pisces—The world Saviour. Mediatorship. In connection with the above, it is interesting to note that the Twins set apart
and unattached in Gemini become the Centaur, the man-beast, in Sagittarius,
whilst Virgo, the Virgin, becomes the Fish goddess in the polar opposite,
Pisces. A treatise could be written on the subject of the relation of the
opposites in the zodiacal circle for they express spirit and matter and their
inter-relation, plus the [183] play of qualitative energies; they bear witness at the same time to the fact that these two are one and are simply the
expression of great mutable, and yet fixed and initiated spiritual Lives. It is
for this reason that the constellation Libra occupies a unique place in the
Great Wheel, for it is the energy coming from this constellation which
controls what we might call (for lack of a more suitable word) the “hub of
the wheel.” This is that point in intermediate space where the twelve
zodiacal energies meet and cross. Libra, therefore, controls the “moment of
reversal of the wheel” in the life of every aspirant, for there comes a
moment in the cycle of lives wherein a point of balance is reached and a
relative equilibrium is attained, and over this event Libra presides. Some
day it will be of interest to make a scientific research and investigation into
the power of balance which Libra wields and a consequent analysis of the
effect of Libra in an individual life. It might then be possible to discover
whether the particular life in which a man carries forward the process of
reversal may not perhaps be one in which the sun is in Leo, with Libra
rising. Such statistical studies have not yet been made, but there is much to
be done along these lines; I only make suggestions, but it will, I think, be
found that this is the case. A proper investigation likewise into the life
history of spiritualism and of the mediums associated with it may prove that
the majority of the mediums in the world who are of a low grade type or
purely trance mediums—negative and usually unintelligent—are born in
Cancer with Pisces rising, or in Pisces with Cancer rising. Such studies
would necessarily have to deal with hundreds of cases and be carried
forward over a long period of time in order to prove the point which I seek
to make. It would also be interesting to make an analysis of those particular
incarnations and their horoscopes wherein [184] the polar opposites both
appear in relation to each other—one as the sun sign and the other as the
ascendant, for these lives usually express some degree of either equilibrium
or of consummation; they will not in any case be negative lives or lacking in
direction, event or purpose. This is particularly the case upon the Fixed
Cross of the Heavens.
You will note that my purpose in this section of our treatise is to evoke
interest and enquiry and to incite students to scientific, statistical and analytical investigation. Only in this way will my basic premises be proven
and eventually substituted for the present unsatisfactory methods—methods
which most astrologers who have any real capacity and insight regard as
deplorable and unsatisfactory.
The ruler of Sagittarius from the orthodox angle is Jupiter, and from the
standpoint of the path of discipleship it is the Earth itself. Mars governs this
sign from the standpoint of the Hierarchies involved. The most interesting
fact which emerges as we study the Mutable Cross as a whole is connected
with the rulers of all the four signs. From the point of view of orthodox
astrology, only two planets rule or govern all the four signs; these are Jupiter
and Mercury. Mercury governs Gemini and Virgo, whilst Jupiter governs
Sagittarius and Pisces. The reason for this is obvious if you study the nature
of the rays which express themselves through these signs. Mercury is the
agent or the messenger of the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict,
whilst Jupiter is the medium for expression of the second Ray of Lovewisdom. These two rays govern the mass of men upon the Mutable Cross
and are closely concerned with the mass incarnation of the fourth Creative
Hierarchy. Their function is to fuse and blend into one cooperative whole
the great dualities expressing themselves through the fourth kingdom in
nature. The significance of this will be [185] obvious. It is easily apparent
how, through the influences of Mercury and Jupiter, material desire can be
transmuted into divine love, and the conflict which is the distinguishing
characteristic of the human family can be instrumental in resolving
dissonance into harmony. The definite pattern and direction of this process
has to take form upon the Mutable Cross before the energies of the Fixed
Cross can change the ambitious selfish man into the selfless disciple. All
this has perforce to be initiated upon the Mutable Cross which is essentially
and significantly the Cross of the mutable, fluidic, restless mind and it is on
this Cross that the mind nature is finally developed and begins its
integrating control of the personality. When this process is proceeding, the
Mutable Cross experience is over and the Cross of Discipleship begins to
play its part. The case is quite different in connection with the subjective side of
unfoldment, and esoterically the disciple who finds himself in incarnation
under the influence of the Mutable Cross in his personality life whilst he, as
a soul, is upon the Fixed Cross, comes under the directed energy of four
planets, three of which are non-sacred planets. Usually these four supersede
or rather begin to dominate the influence of Mercury and Jupiter, giving
greater facility of expression and exerting that influence which will bring
the personality into right relation to the soul, for that is essentially the task
of the Fixed Cross and the goal of the disciple. It is in connection with the
planets governing Sagittarius, exoterically and esoterically, that an idea can
easily be gained of the complexity of the forces with which every disciple
has to contend and the significance of the ray forces which pour into and
through him. Take for example the constellation which we are now
considering, and remember that the same basic streams of energy will have
to be [186] noted in connection with every other sign in which a man may
take incarnation. We find that we shall have to consider:
1. The Sun Sign.—In this case Sagittarius conditions circumstances,
indicating inheritance and forcing the environment to be declarative in
connection with the subject.
2. The Rising Sign.—The ascendant can be one of the other eleven signs.
3. The Mutable Cross.—The four energies which meet “at the midway
point” and have a united and definite effect upon the subject. The
same statement applies to the other two Crosses. Júpiter . The Orthodox Planets.—These condition the personality. In this case
we have Mercury and Jupiter. The twelve houses governed by the
planets are likewise of prime importance from the angle of the
transmitted energy.
5. The Esoteric Planets.—These bring in renewed or increased planetary
energy and ray energy in a more dynamic manner. In the case of
Sagittarius these energies are Venus, the Moon, the Earth and Pluto.
6. The Planetary Ruler of a Hierarchy.—In this particular case, this
planet is Mars, ruling the sixth Creative Hierarchy, the lunar Lords (the elementals of the threefold personality) who have to be brought
under the control of the solar Lord.
A study of the above will reveal most interesting relationships and prove my
point anent the multiplicity of energies to which the wonderful mechanism
of man can respond and [187] to which, as evolution proceeds, he can
become increasingly sensitive.
I cannot here enter into a detailed analysis of the many energies which pour
through the disciple as he arrives at the final stages upon the Mutable Cross,
and in Sagittarius achieves the determination to “direct his steps into
another way of life and with ardour firm to mount another Cross,” as the
Old Commentary puts it. I can only point out that the following ray forces
pour onto the man through the medium of the following planets:

Devotion. War to the death of the personality or form. An analysis of this will show that the “forces of conflict” are powerful in
this sign, primarily in the life of the disciple. Harmony through Conflict is
ceaselessly active and appears in both the orthodox and the esoteric
assignments. The destructive power of the first ray, focussed in Pluto, brings
change, darkness and death. To this intensity and potency of Pluto must be
added the forceful and dynamic energy of the planet Mars. This brings the
entire human family, as well as the individual, under the law of strife, based
this time upon sixth ray devotion to an ideal, high or low. All these play
upon the individual born in the sign of [188] Sagittarius, as well as upon the
fourth Creative Hierarchy as a whole. This, you can see for yourself, brings
in a terrific situation, and the forces playing upon the disciple are of a
momentous nature—provided that the mechanism of awareness is adequate
to respond. These forces in all the signs are ever present, but responsiveness and sensitivity to their impact is dependent upon the nature of the response
apparatus. Ponder upon this thought, for it is this sensitivity which marks
the difference between the disciple and the average man.
These planetary influences are distinctive of the Sons of Mind , of Venusian
origin; they are characteristic of the Lords of Sacrifice and Will functioning
in time and space as the fourth Creative Hierarchy. The form life is ruled by
the Moon, veiling a hidden planet; these Sons of Mind live on the Earth and
thus within the body of the planetary Logos, and are of a definitely
intelligent nature, making them Lords of Knowledge, achieving their goal
through the light of the mind and through the method of conflict, for they
are also Lords of Ceaseless and Persevering Devotion. All the above names
which are related to the planets governing Sagittarius will be remembered
by students of The Secret Doctrine . They are the “quality names” of the
Divine Manasaputras , the Agnishvattas who are ourselves.
A consideration of the above paragraph will indicate to you the importance
of the sign Sagittarius in the life of the incarnating Sons of God.
I would point out also that, through Jupiter and its influences, Sagittarius is
related to three other great constellations:
1. Pisces—Exoterically, indicating the final goal for man.
2. Aquarius—Esoterically, indicating the purpose of all [189] material
evolution and the objective of all incarnating processes.
3. Virgo—Hierarchically, indicating the purpose of the Cosmic Christ.
Both the Earth and Saturn (one a non-sacred and one a sacred planet) are
exponents or expressions of the third Ray of Active Intelligence, and this
ray relationship serves to bring the influences of Capricorn into relationship
with Sagittarius, thus providing a field of energy wherein the one-pointed
disciple can finally become the initiate. This is the set goal of the subject
born in Sagittarius—whether it is the set goal of initiation into some form of
sensuous experience or of spiritual undertaking and consciousness. The
result of all experience in any sign of the zodiac should definitely work out
as an expansion of consciousness and, no matter what form this experience may take, it consummates in an initiation of some kind or another. Students
would do well to regard initiation as a determining process in life, and
should endeavour that every life experience or cycle of life experiences
should work out as an initiation into a wider field of awareness, of
expression and of resultant contact.
There is little more that I need say and little else upon which I need at this
stage of study to comment. The man who is nearing the path of discipleship
or who is already a disciple—pledged or under observation—will profit
much from a deep and systematic study of this sign. I would suggest that the
student bear in mind the position of this sign. Scorpio stands midway
between two signs of balance or of equilibrium—Sagittarius and Libra.
Libra marks an interlude or a notable point of balance before the strenuous
testing and trial of Scorpio. Sagittarius marks another point of balance
which follows after that testing, for the [190] Archer has to acquire and hold
a steady eye, hand and stance prior to firing the arrow which, when rightly
directed and correctly followed, will carry him through the portal of
initiation.
In studying Sagittarius, it becomes obvious that one of the major underlying
themes is that of Direction . The Archer is guiding his horse towards some
one specific objective; he is sending or directing his arrow towards a desired
point; he is aiming at some specific goal. This sense of direction or guidance
is characteristic of the enlightened man, of the aspirant and disciple, and this
is a growing recognition; when this faculty of sensitive direction is rightly
developed it becomes, in the early stages, an effort to identify all soul and
personality activity with God's Plan, and this is, in the last analysis, the
ordered direction of God's thought. There is no true direction apart from
thought, and I would have you remember that thought is power . This is a
statement upon which all disciples should ponder, for they can achieve no
real comprehension of the direction of God's Plan unless they work with a
phase in their own lives which is subject to their own mental direction. Then
and only then, can they understand. Upon the ordinary wheel of life, the
man who is born in this sign or with this sign in the ascendant will be influenced by what the ancient Hindu Scriptures call kama-manas, which is
inadequately translated by the words, desire-mind. This dual force controls
and influences the life; in the early stages of unfoldment its focus is upon
desire and the satisfaction of that desire and, in the later stages of purely
personality development, the focus is upon the control of desire by the
mind; the major objective is, at this time, the intelligent use of all powers to
bring about adequate satisfaction of desire, which is, in this case, very
frequently simply ambition to [191] achieve some goal or attain some
objective. This process of personality satisfaction takes place upon the
ordinary wheel. Upon the reversed wheel, the goal is the expression of lovewisdom and this is ever selflessly developed and always consecrated to the
good of the whole and not to the satisfaction of the individual.
We are told that Sagittarius governs the thighs, which are the main centre of
physical power and protective strength, and also the sacral centre which
provides the energy for the use of the creative powers of the physical life.
This is also symbolically true. In Sagittarius, the disciple has two things to
discover within himself; these are the power to make progress upon the path
and to walk the Way, and also the ability to create in the higher and spiritual
sense. This concerns the relationship between the sacral and the throat
centres. These powers (the higher powers) are as yet embryonic in the
earlier Sagittarian experience of the disciple, but they become more
developed and potent as he cyclically returns to life experience in this sign.
It is interesting to note that no planet is exalted in Sagittarius and that no
planet falls in this sign. Only one thing happens and that is that the power of
Mercury is greatly lessened. For this reason Sagittarius is esoterically
regarded as a sign of balance and of no extremes; there is no great fall and
no exaltation. This fact indicates that the disciple has to walk an even way
between the pairs of opposites, uninfluenced by either the “power of
exaltation or the potency of that which falls.” Neither the valley nor the
heights produces any demonstrable effect.
Mercury, which is the expression of the fourth ray and also the God of the
mental processes, has his power definitely lessened in this sign and this for two reasons, esoterically speaking:
[192] First, the disciple has definitely to cease identifying himself with
either his own human personality and processes or with the human
kingdom, prior to taking initiation. His emphasis is, for the future, to be
upon the spiritual soul and the fifth kingdom in nature; in Sagittarius he
begins to express this first stage. This involves a complete withdrawal, in
the personality sense, from the form side of life. This again entails (at a
certain point of crisis) a point of balance.
Secondly, the power of the mind, having been developed, tested and found
true in the sign Scorpio, begins to wane in its activity and the intuition
begins to take its place. This is essential before the sign Capricorn is entered
by the disciple and preparation for initiation begins.
As regards the three decanates of Sagittarius, Sepharial gives us the three
governing planets as Mercury, the Moon and the Sun, whilst Alan Leo gives
us Jupiter, Mars and the Sun, emphasising as he always does the way of the
esotericists. He usually tunes in on the esoteric significances but not always.
Jupiter gives expansion, superseding Mercury, for the mercurial mind is
ever a limitation even if only a temporary one. The Moon gives place to
Mars, which confers the quality of devotion and the capacity to fight for an
ideal. This idealistic concept and method of work is always the
characteristic of discipleship during the early stages of unfoldment upon the
Path. The Sun, typifying the solar Angel remains constant both through the
exoteric and the esoteric processes and therefore astrology recognises it as a
constant pressure and presence. This fact in itself indicates a significant
truth. The soul remains eternally present—in the past, in the present and on
into the future.
In closing, I will simply quote to you the two keywords [193] of this sign,
both as it proceeds upon the ordinary wheel and upon the reversed wheel.
Their meaning and significance are so obvious that there is no need for
elucidation. The injunction to the man upon the orthodox wheel is as
follows: And the Word said: “Let food be sought.”
To the man upon the reversed wheel the Word goes forth:
“I see the goal. I reach that goal and then I see another.” May the words
of this final injunction to the disciple carry meaning to the heart and
mind. SCORPIO, THE SCORPION
We come now to the consideration of a sign which is of paramount
importance in the life of evolving man. Certain of the signs are in very close
relation—through the inflow and the outflow of energy—with certain of the
major constellations. These major constellations are, in a few instances,
peculiarly connected with the signs of the zodiac. There are four of the
zodiacal signs which are mysteriously concerned with what one might call
the “personality expression” (if such an unsuitable term can be used in
default of better) of the solar Logos Himself, or with the Divine Quaternary,
the fourfold manifestation of Deity.
These four signs are Aries—Leo—Scorpio—Aquarius, and they involve the
expression of the energy of one Cardinal sign and of three signs which form
part of the Fixed Cross of the heavens. We could express this truth in
another manner: God the Father, the Will to manifest, initiates the creative
process which is worked out through the activity of God the Son, the cosmic
Christ, crucified upon the Fixed Cross in the heavens. The activity of God
[194] the Holy Spirit, implicit in the Mutable Cross, is closely allied to the
previous solar system, and the energy of that divine aspect is practically
entirely occupied with manipulating the forces inherited from that system
and inherent in the very nature of substance itself. This divine aspect is to
the whole general divine manifestation what the lower nature (form life or
personality in the three worlds of human evolution) is to the soul where an
individual human being is concerned. As regards these three Persons of the
divine Trinity, we might say that:
1. Aries is the focal point of the expression of the first aspect of divinity,
the will aspect. 2. Leo is the focal point for the expression of the second aspect, the lovewisdom or consciousness aspect. This, primarily where humanity is
concerned.
3. Virgo is the focal point for the expression of the third aspect, that of
active intelligence. In that sign the highest function of matter is
symbolised.
The four signs—Aries, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius—are related to the
following stars which are not numbered in the twelve signs of the zodiac;
they constitute another field of relationships:
Aries to one of the two stars, found in the constellation, the Great Bear,
which are called the two Pointers.
Leo to Polaris, the Pole Star, found in the Little Bear.
Scorpio to Sirius, the Dog Star.
Aquarius to Alcyone, one of the seven Pleiades.
There is little that I can tell you in connection with the energies pouring into
the four zodiacal signs from these distant though potent points of outgoing
energy; they are part of the life expression of an Identity, immeasurably
superior [195] to and more advanced than our solar Logos. A few hints may,
however, be of service to the truly esoteric astrologer who may study these
pages, particularly where Scorpio is concerned. Scorpio, at this particular
stage of human evolution, governs the Path of Discipleship. You will note
here also how Leo-Scorpio-Aquarius form a peculiar triangle of force, but
of this I will later deal in Chapter III under the heading, The Science of
Triangles.
Aries is, as might be expected, closely connected with the Great Bear but
peculiarly so with one of the stars called The Pointers; these point to the
Pole star which is at this time a major “star of direction.” Direction, will,
purpose and plan are all connected with the solar Logos and with His
evolutionary undertakings in connection with the many lives manifesting in
the vehicle of expression which we call the solar system. All these respond
to the influences of the first ray which is, to all intents and purposes, the energy of divine embodied will, which has been esoterically described as
“unavoidable directed purpose.” Within our solar system, Vulcan and Pluto
are expressions or custodians of this first ray energy and are, as I have told
you, esoteric planets. The first indication of the true spiritual will only
begins to manifest upon the Path of Discipleship—hence the late discovery
of these two planets (late in point of time and from the angle of human
knowledge) for it is only in this Aryan race period that humanity is to any
large extent beginning to manifest evidence (and as yet it is no more) of a
reaction or a response to the spiritual will of deity as it comes to our planet
and hence to us via Aries, Vulcan and Pluto. You have, therefore, the
following direct line of will energy:
1. The Pointer furthest from the Pole Star in the constellation of the Great
Bear. This is, esoterically speaking, [196] a great reservoir or focal point for
divine energy, carrying out God's purpose. The Pointer nearest to the Pole
Star is expressive of a lower aspect of the will, which—in speaking of
humanity—we call self-will.
2. Aries , in which the will to create or to manifest makes its appearance and
the great divine experiment is initiated.
3. Vulcan and Pluto are related to the two Pointers and are only now
beginning, in any definite and clear manner, to affect human response. Their
effect has been planetary in its nature up to date and has not hitherto been at
all effective in either the fourth or the second kingdoms in nature. Júpiter . Shamballa , the Custodian of the Plan for our planet.
Leo is the sign wherein the consciousness of individuality is developed,
utilised and finally consecrated to divine purpose. It is related to Polaris, the
Pole Star (found in the Little Bear) and it is also peculiarly susceptible to the
influence of that Pointer in the Great Bear which is the nearest to the Pole
Star. Esoterically speaking, the Pole Star is regarded as the “star of reorientation” whereby the art of “refacing and recovering that which is lost”
is developed. This eventually brings a man back to his originating source. It
might, therefore, be correctly inferred that this Pointer and the energy emanating from it guides humanity upon the involutionary path, and is
constantly active in its influence upon the man who is still upon the Mutable
Cross. Then the energy of the Pointer furthest from the Pole Star begins to
make its presence felt and a sense of right direction or guidance is registered
by the disciple upon the Path, and such guidance (when followed) leads man
nearer to the Hierarchy. It is here that the divine [197] necessity of
achieving alignment is portrayed for us in the symbolism of the sky and
when it has been achieved then there is a direct inflow of divine energy and
man is linked up in a new and creative manner to sources of divine supply.
Astrologers will do well (in connection with the horoscopes of disciples and
particularly of initiates) to consider the two Pointers and the Pole Star. They
are mysteriously connected with the three aspects of incarnated man—
Spirit, soul and body. More than this it is not permitted to me to convey to
you. I may, however, give you another hint. These three stars are
embodiments of the three aspects of divine will. It is the three aspects of all
expressions of divinity in manifestation which underlie the Science of
Triangles . This I will later elaborate.
Another triangle of energy also appears: Aries, Leo and Polaris, and they are
doubly connected through the medium of the Pointers.
Scorpio is under the influence or inflowing energy of Sirius. This is the
great star of initiation because our Hierarchy (an expression of the second
aspect of divinity) is under the supervision or spiritual magnetic control of
the Hierarchy of Sirius. These are the major controlling influences whereby
the cosmic Christ works upon the Christ principle in the solar system, in the
planet, in man and in the lower forms of life expression. It is esoterically
called the “brilliant star of sensitivity.” You have therefore:
Polaris—The Star of Direction—governing Shamballa. Later, another Pole
Star will take the place of Polaris, owing to the interplay of forces in the
universe and the general shift and movement. But the name and quality of
this star will only be revealed at initiation. [198]
Sirius—The Star of Sensitivity—governing the Hierarchy. Alcyone—The Star of the Individual—governing humanity.
You can see from the above how the entire plan of this Treatise is gradually
unfolding. It was necessary for me to indicate to you the nature and the
purpose of the three divine centres—Shamballa, the Hierarchy, and
Humanity—before I could make this part of the teaching clear to you, or
before I could point out the nature of the energies pouring from distant
constellations and zodiacal signs into our planetary scheme.
Scorpio is the great constellation which influences the turning point both in
the life of humanity and the life of the individual human being. For the first
time in the history of both mankind and disciples the energy of Sirius,
pouring into the seven groups which form our planetary Hierarchy evokes a
response. I would remind you of a basic fact in the evolutionary process
which astrology will eventually prove scientifically and past all controversy.
This is the fact that energies and forces are pouring upon our system and our
planetary lives ceaselessly, potently and cyclically. Yet they are only
regarded today as existing when definite response is evoked. They come
from all kinds of sources, extraneous to our system and planetary schemes,
but until man responds and registers them both scientists and astrologers fail
to recognise them and they are as if they were not. This is a point to bear in
mind as I continue to teach you, for I may indicate some sources of active
energy which may as yet be unknown to you as playing upon our system
and its contents. The difficulty will not be because of my inaccuracies but
will be owing to the lack of sensitivity in the mechanism of response which
mankind and disciples are at present utilising.
[199] You have consequently in connection with the path of discipleship the
following lines of “influential energy”:
1. Sirius—working in a sevenfold manner through the seven rays and
their seven groups as these constitute the active Hierarchy.
2. The Fixed Cross—a fusion of four major energies, pouring into our
solar system, on to our planet and through humanity. 3. Scorpio—an aspect of the Fixed Cross, of peculiar and specialised
potency upon the Path of Discipleship and preparing, with its tests
and trials:
a. The process of re-orientation, whereby a man mounts the Fixed
Cross and leaves the Mutable Cross.
b. The disciple for the first, second and third initiations. After the
third initiation, its peculiar testing potency is no longer felt. Júpiter . The Hierarchy.—The distributing agency to the various kingdoms in
nature.
5. Mars and Saturn.—Both these planets are exceedingly potent in
connection with initiation into the life of the Hierarchy; Mars is
potent in relation to Scorpio and Saturn in relation to Capricorn. This
involves the intensified activity of the 6th and the 3rd rays and their
energies, and when these are rightly employed there comes liberation
from form control and the release of the conscious individual.
Again, astrologers would do well to work with this line of fused forces,
studying its implications and effects in the life of the disciple.
[200] Aquarius relates humanity to the Pleiades and therefore to Taurus in
an unusual manner. The key to this relation is to be found in the word desire
, leading, through the transmutative processes of life experience, to
aspiration and finally the relinquishing of desire in Scorpio. Aquarius,
Alcyone and Humanity constitute a most interesting triangle of force.
Alcyone is one of the seven Pleiades and is called the “star of the
Individual” and sometimes the “star of intelligence.” It was potently active
during the previous solar system wherein the Third Person of the Trinity
was peculiarly omnipotent and active, just as today the cosmic Christ, the
Second Person of the Trinity, is peculiarly active in this solar system. The
energies coming from Alcyone impregnated the substance of the universe
with the quality of mind. As a consequence of this most ancient activity, the
same force was present at the time of individualisation in this solar system,
for it is in this system, and primarily upon our planet, the Earth, that the major results of that early activity have made themselves felt. Two of our
planets, the Earth (non-sacred) and Uranus (sacred), are directly the product
of this third ray activity. This is of great importance to remember. I would
also ask you to link this thought with the teaching that through the divine
centre of intelligent activity which we call humanity, the fourth kingdom in
nature will eventually act as the mediating principle to all the three lower
kingdoms. Humanity is the divine Messenger to the world of form; it is
essentially Mercury, bringing light and life to other divine manifestations
and of this all divine world Saviours are the eternal symbols.
This coming process of planetary service through the third divine centre is
only truly effective when Aquarius rules and when our sun is passing
through that sign of the [201] zodiac. Hence the immense importance of the
next 2000 years. Therefore, only when a man is a world server and
becoming group conscious can this desired objective of manifestation begin
to demonstrate. It is beginning to happen today for the first time in planetary
history. It is one of the first fruits of initiation and only in the next root race
to our present Aryan race will we begin really to understand the significance
of the process and the true nature of the energies to be released through the
medium of humanity upon the planet. It is for this reason that Jupiter and
Uranus (expressions of the second and the seventh rays) are the exoteric and
esoteric rulers of Aquarius.
You have, therefore, the following line of force to study:
1. Alcyone—in the Pleiades, the mothers of the seven aspects of form
life and the “wives of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear.” They are
connected with the Mother aspect which nurtures the infant Christ.
2. Aquarius—the World Server, the transmitter of energy which evokes
magnetic response.
3. Jupiter and Uranus—planets of beneficent consummation. The second
ray of love and the seventh ray which fuses spirit and matter “to the
ultimate glory” of the solar Logos are in the fullest eventual
cooperation. Júpiter . Humanity—the focal point for all these energies and the divine
distributor of them to individual man and later to the lower three
kingdoms in nature.
Thus you see, that from a generalisation re the exterior constellations
(exterior to the zodiac and the solar system itself) we are becoming more
specific, showing how certain stars in these constellations are definitely
related by direct [202] lines of energy to our planet; these lines of force
usually reach us via one of the zodiacal signs and—in rare cases— directly
to a planet. The latter case is, however, exceedingly rare. We have also
brought into relation to our solar system another constellation, called the
Little Bear which is a reflection of or a corollary to the major energies of its
greater prototype, Ursa Major, the Great Bear. These facts contain a great
mystery connected with the inter-relation of Ursa Major, Ursa Minor and the
Pleiades; they constitute one of the greatest and more important of the
triplicities to be found in the heavens as far as we have astronomically
ascertained the nature of our immediate universe. This is a perfectly
unimportant piece of information as far as you are concerned and is only of
significance to initiates of the fourth degree. It serves, nevertheless, to add
its evidence to the essential integrity and interlocking dependencies of the
universe.
In order the better to understand the nature of discipleship and the processes
of stabilisation and right direction, we must precede the Capricornian
experience of initiation with a careful study of the spiritual implications of
the sign Scorpio and of its function in providing “points of crisis” and
“moments of reorientation,” as this will be of the utmost value to the earnest
student. Even though I am endeavouring to lay the foundation for the new
astrology and to provide some measure of technical information from the
point of view of the Hierarchy, my underlying motive is ever the same: to
indicate the way of living process and to stimulate that divine curiosity and
that sense of outgoing spiritual adventure and eager aspiration for progress
which is latent in all disciples and which, when stimulated, will enable them
to proceed more serenely and sanely upon the [203] Path of Return. Otherwise the practical value of that which I seek to impart is of no real
importance at all; I shall be understood and the new astrology will come
into being according to the esoteric capacity of those who read and ponder
my words. I am exceedingly anxious that in these days wherein the
influence of Scorpio and of the planet Mars is so strongly felt in world
affairs that true insight may be cultivated, optimism and understanding
developed and the nature of the tests to which the world disciple, humanity,
is today being subjected may be estimated at their true value and thus light
be shed upon the way of man. Only through understanding will solution
come and rectification of error be achieved.
The tests of Scorpio are necessarily three in nature as they concern
intimately the readiness of the threefold personality:
1. To reorient itself to the life of the soul and later
2. To evidence readiness for initiation.
3. To demonstrate sensitivity to the Plan thus becoming the one-pointed
disciple in Sagittarius.
The three major tests are again divided into three stages, and upon the Path
of Discipleship the man may find himself passing into this sign for testing
and experience nine times. The fact of the three tests each existing in their
three stages may convey a hint to esoteric astrologers as to the purpose of
the three decanates into which each sign is divided—a point upon which I
shall hope to touch when we come to our study of the Science of Triangles.
Each test (and therefore each decanate) concerns the three aspects which in
this Treatise on the Seven Rays we have called: life, quality and appearance.
Thus the three great [204] tests in Scorpio are in reality nine tests and hence
the nine-headed Hydra or Serpent which is ever associated with Scorpio and
hence also the nature of the stupendous victory achieved by Hercules, the
Sun-God, in this sign.
It is interesting to note that each of the great Sons of God Whose names are
pre-eminent in the minds of men—Hercules, the Buddha and the Christ—
are associated in the archives of the Great White Lodge with three special signs of the zodiac (which in a peculiar manner constitute the “zodiacal
decanate”) in each of which They passed from test to victory.
In Scorpio—Hercules became the triumphant disciple.
In Taurus—The Buddha achieved victory over desire and arrived at
illumination.
In Pisces—The Christ overcame death and became the world saviour.
These three constellations, therefore, form a triangle of initiation of
profound importance because it provides those conditions and that energy
which will test and perfect the three aspects of the personality so that they
are true reflections of the three divine aspects; they concern soul and body
primarily and therefore their expression is through the Mutable Cross and
the Fixed Cross but not the Cardinal Cross. We might add to the above the
following:
1. Scorpio carries the test right down into the physical plane life, and
then, when it is faced and handled there, the life of the man is carried
up into heaven, and the problem which the test involved is solved by
the use of the reasoning mind.
2. Taurus governs desire and carries the test into the emotional [205] or
astral plane, and carries desire-sensitivity up from the form side of life
into that world of sensitive perception which we call the intuitional
plane.
3. Pisces carries the test into the region of the mental processes, which is
the reflection of the will aspect of divinity; the problem of the initiate
in this sign is voiced by Christ in the words, “Father, not my will but
Thine be done.” The tests carry the self-will of the personality up into
the region of the divine will and the result is inspiration and the
emergence of a world saviour.
Ponder upon the above and learn the lessons of appetite, of desire and of
self-will for they are many and useful.
The three tests in Scorpio also concern the three aspects of the human being
as they fuse and blend upon the physical plane. They are, first of all, the test of appetite. This appetite is the natural predilections and tendencies which
are inherent in the animal nature and these are mainly three: Sex, physical
comfort, and money, as concretised energy. They are, secondly, the tests
connected with desire and the astral plane. These are subtler in nature,
producing automatic effects upon the physical plane; they are not inherent in
the animal nature but are imposed by the desire nature and are again three in
number: Fear, hatred and ambition or desire for power. Then there are,
thirdly, the tests of the lower critical mind which are: Pride, separativeness
and cruelty. Remember that the worst kind of cruelty is not of a physical
nature but is more mental in character. Therefore, you have in the category
of that which must be tested and proved to be non-existent the following
categories, which I am re-enumerating because of their basic importance:
[206]
(1) 1. Sex—the relation of the pairs of opposites. These can be selfishly utilised or divinely
blended.
2. Physical comfort—life conditions, selfishly appropriated.
3. Money—selfishly cornered (if I may use such a phrase).
(2) 1. Fear—which conditions activity today.
2. Hate—which is a factor in conditioning relationships.
3. Ambition—conditioning objectives.
(3) 1. Pride—which is intellectual satisfaction, making the mind the barrier to soul control.
2. Separativeness—which is the isolated attitude and which makes the mind the barrier to right
group relations.
3. Cruelty—which is satisfaction with personality methods and which makes the mind the
instrument of the sense of power. When these faults are realised and are overcome, the result is twofold: the
establishing of right relations with the soul and also with the environment.
These two results are the goal of all tests in Scorpio.
The keynotes of this sign are, therefore, test, trial and triumph. They can
also be called struggle, strength and Sagittarian attitudes. Another angle of
the experience in Scorpio can be covered by two words: re-capitulation and
re-orientation. In Scorpio, two most occult factors emerge from the past and
begin to engross the attention of the disciple. One is memory and the other
is, as a consequence of the memory, the Dweller on the Threshold. Memory in the sense here involved is not simply just [207] a faculty of the mind, as
is so oft supposed, but it is essentially a creative power. It is basically an
aspect of thought and—coupled with imagination—is a creative agent
because thoughts are things, as well you know. From ancient recesses of the
memory, from a deeply rooted past which is definitely recalled, and from
the racial and the individual subconscious (or founded and established
thought reservoirs and desires, inherited and inherent) there emerges from
individual past lives and experience that which is the sum total of all
instinctual tendencies, of all inherited glamours and of all phases of wrong
mental attitudes; to these (as they constitute a blended whole) we give the
name of the Dweller on the Threshold. This Dweller is the sum total of all
the personality characteristics which have remained unconquered and
unsubdued and which must be finally overcome before initiation can be
taken. Each life sees some progress made; some personality defects
straightened out and some real advance effected. But the unconquered
residue and the ancient liabilities are numerous and excessively potent and
—when soul contact is adequately established—there eventuates a life
wherein the highly developed and powerful personality becomes, in itself,
the Dweller on the Threshold. Then the Angel of the Presence and the
Dweller stand face to face and something must then be done. Eventually, the
light of the personal self fades out and wanes in the blaze of glory which
emanates from the Angel. Then the greater glory obliterates the lesser. This
is, however, only possible when the personality eagerly enters into this
relation with the Angel, recognises itself as the Dweller and—as a disciple
—begins the battle between the pairs of opposites and enters into the tests of
Scorpio. These tests and trials are ever self-initiated; the disciple puts
himself into the positive or conditioning environment [208] wherein the
trials and the discipline are unavoidable and inevitable. When the mind has
reached a relatively high stage of development, the memory aspect is
evoked in a new and conscious manner and then every latent predisposition, every racial and national instinct, every unconquered situation
and every controlling fault rises to the surface of consciousness and then—
the fight is on. The keynote of Scorpio is, however, Triumph . This is its major expression upon the physical plane. As a result of struggle and of
victory, the whole divine man—not yet perfectly expressing himself, if I
might word the situation thus—is anchored upon the physical plane with
such accuracy and clarity that there is no escape from the environing
conclusions of the disciple's family, friends and group that he is a disciple.
From that angle he is meticulously watched; he learns the meaning of the
word “example”; he is pilloried by those who are onlookers and the first
conscious stages toward group awareness and group response, plus group
service, are now taken. Such is the outcome and the reward of the
experience in Scorpio.
It is in this sign that the prodigal son comes to himself, and having eaten of
the husks of life and having exhausted the resources of worldly desire and
ambition—he says: “I will arise and go to my Father.” There are two such
major crises in the life of the aspirant:
1. When the intelligent man of the world comes to himself and then reorients himself to the soul and its requirements. This leads to the tests
in Scorpio.
2. When the initiate of the third degree—upon a higher turn of the spiral
—re-orients himself to the Monad and passes through most subtle
tests to certain undefinable [209] and spiritual recognitions. Upon
these we need not enlarge.
There is little for me to add here in connection with the fact that Scorpio is
upon one of the four arms of the Fixed Cross. In the study of previous signs,
much anent the Fixed Cross has already been covered and there is no need
for me to repeat the information here. Desire in Taurus becomes spiritual
aspiration in Scorpio. The darkness of the experience in Scorpio becomes
illumination in Taurus, for it must never be forgotten that where the pairs of
opposites are concerned they gain and profit from each other, for there is a
direct line of force and of contact between the two. This is a fact which is
seldom recognised. We come now to a consideration of the Rulers which govern the sign,
Scorpio. Their influence is potent in the lives of the average or undeveloped
man who responds more easily to the planetary influences in the twelve
houses of his personality horoscope than does the more advanced man who
is coming under the direct influence of the zodiacal signs. Through these
Rulers, two rays are brought into a potent controlling position in Scorpio;
they are the sixth Ray of Devotion and the fourth Ray of Harmony through
Conflict, the latter having a peculiar relation to the mode of human
development and the former to the methods of the Piscean age which is just
passing. Mars and Mercury control and Mars is particularly active, owing to
the fact that Mars is both the orthodox planet controlling the personality in
Scorpio and also the esoteric planet conditioning the unfoldment of the
disciple. Mars is the dominating factor in the tests and trials of the disciple,
prior to the experience in Sagittarius and the initiation in Capricorn, and this
for the following reasons:
[210] First, Mars is definitely the planet which rules and controls the
physical vehicle. Mars appears first of all as the orthodox ruler in Aries, the
sign in which the first move is made towards bringing about objective
manifestation, or physical incarnation. In Scorpio, the result of all the
struggles carried forward during the seemingly endless pilgrimage around
the zodiac or wheel of life is brought to a point of climax, again through the
activity of Mars which has not appeared actively in the intervening signs
between Aries and Scorpio as far as the reversed wheel is concerned. The
disciple has now to demonstrate the strength, character and quality which he
has unfolded and developed within himself during his long pilgrimage. He
started in Aries with Mars ruling, and the great war between the dualities
which constitute the man began. The pairs of opposites were thus brought
into relation with each other. In Scorpio, with the same planet ruling his
interior life, the war is on and in this case Mars rules not only the physical
body but the entire form vehicle, which we call the personality in the three
worlds. All aspects of the lower nature are involved in this crisis, for Mars is
the esoteric ruler in Scorpio and the tests applied involve the form nature—
gross and subtle, integrated and potent. Mars, therefore, rules Aries from the orthodox angle and Scorpio esoterically, and does not again appear in the
life of the individual except as that individual responds to mass vibration in
Sagittarius, where Mars appears as ruling the sixth Creative Hierarchy, the
lunar lords of the form nature who must eventually be sacrificed to the
higher spiritual aspect and brought under the control of the solar Angel. The
effect of Mars is, therefore, largely mass effect and group results, producing
great struggles but leading finally to great revelation. In Aries, it is the final
revelation of the nature of knowledge and the purpose of [211] incarnation;
in Scorpio, it is the revelation of the vision of liberation and service; in
Sagittarius, it is the revelation of the purpose of soul control over the lower
kingdoms in nature, via the human centre of energy. It must consequently
never be forgotten that Mars establishes relations between the opposites and
is a beneficent and not a malefic factor, as is so often supposed. When we
come to study the Hierarchies and their relation to the signs, certain points
which are at present obscure will be clarified. This we shall do when dealing
with our final point in this section upon astrology and the rays. We shall
then find that Scorpio rules and governs the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the
human from the angle of the soul and not from the angle of the lower nature.
The final struggle in Scorpio only takes place when the point of balance
between soul and body has been reached in Libra and it is in Scorpio that
the preponderance of the spiritual energy is imposed upon the lower
personal forces. Scorpio governs “the initiates,” which is the true esoteric
name of man, and through its hierarchical planetary ruler, the Sons of Mind,
the Messengers of Deity are revealed, but it is through Mars and the Martian
activity that the revelation comes about.
Secondly, Mars is closely related to sex, which is an aspect of the pairs of
opposites, and its effect is also definitely to vitalise the blood stream; it
vitalises, purifies and stimulates all aspects and organisms in the body, via
the blood stream. It will be obvious to you, therefore, how the tests in
Scorpio and the activity of Mars are potent to arouse the entire lower nature
and bring about its final rebellion and the last stand, so to speak, of the
personality against the soul. It is Mars who brings the world Arjuna into the
active fight. The whole man is then engaged and the “quarrel of the sexes” is resolved in its highest aspect [212] through the battle between the highly
developed personality or form nature and the soul which seeks to be the
ultimate controlling factor.
The colour assigned to Mars is, as you know, red and this is a
correspondence to the colour of the blood stream and hence also the
association of Mars with passion, with anger and a sense of general
opposition. The sense of duality is exceedingly powerful. Hence also the
necessity for the entire life of man (for the blood is the life in this sense) to
be swung into the conflict, leaving no side of human nature uninvolved;
hence again the need for the disciple to carry his physical nature, his
emotional or desire nature and his mental processes up into heaven. This
takes place as a consequence of overcoming the “serpent of evil” (the form
nature with its promptings and demands) by the means of the “serpent of
wisdom,” which is the esoteric name oft given to the soul.
In connection with the symbolic connection between Mars and the blood,
producing the resultant conflict between life and death (for Scorpio is one of
the signs of death), it is interesting to note that Christianity is governed by
Mars. One is apt to recognise with ease that the sixth ray, working through
Mars, rules Christianity. It is a religion of devotion, fanaticism, of high
courage, of idealism, of the spiritual emphasis upon the individual and his
worth and problem, of conflict and of death. All those characteristics are
familiar to us in the presentation of Christian theology. It is however preeminently a religion which has waged a cruel and oft illogical war upon sex
and its implications; it has emphasised a militant celibacy (militant where
women and their rights and natures are concerned); it has regarded the sex
relation as one of the primary evils in the world and has laid the emphasis
upon [213] the inviolable nature of the marriage bond when endorsed by the
Church. This has all been the result of the beneficent or the malefic effect of
the impact of sixth ray force upon the form nature. Little emphasis has been
laid nevertheless upon the influence of Mars upon Christianity, making it a
definitely militant religion, oft cruel and sadistic (as witness the murders
and tortures carried out in the name of Christ, who was the outstanding Representative of God's love). Throughout the teaching of Christian
theology, the theme of blood runs ceaselessly and the source of salvation is
laid upon the blood relationship and not upon the life aspect which the
blood veils and symbolises. It is the creed of a crucified and dead Christ
which rules Christianity and not that of the risen Master. One of the reasons
for this travesty of the truth has been that St. Paul, that great initiate, prior to
taking the third initiation which he did at the time he was functioning as
related in The Acts of the Apostles , was potently under Martian influence
and was born in Scorpio; a study of his horoscope would demonstrate this
were you in a position to study as can we who are connected with the
Hierarchy. It was he who gave the Scorpio-Mars slant to the interpretation
and exposition of the Christian teaching and deflected its energy into
channels of teaching which its Founder had never intended. Such is often
the undesirable effect of the activities of well-meaning disciples upon the
work which they undertake to carry on after the originator of some work for
the Hierarchy passes over to the other side through death or relinquishes his
task in order to take up other duties.
The blood theme and the death theme, the suffering and the dire testing of
the disciple, the value of the individual conflict and the consciousness of the
misery of existence are basically due to the combined influences of Scorpio
and of [214] Mars which have ruled Christianity for so long and which are
only now beginning somewhat to lose their influence.
A study of the processes of death as the sign Scorpio conditions them and
the processes of death as we see them working out in the sign Pisces would
be of very real value. Death through the influences of Pluto and death
through the influences of Mars are widely different. Death in Pisces through
the energy of Pluto is transformation—a transformation so vital and so basic
that the
“... Ancient One is no longer seen. He sinks to the depth of the ocean of
life; he descends into hell, but the gates of hell hold him not. He, the
new and living One leaves below that which has held him down throughout the ages and rises from the depths unto the heights, close
to the throne of God.”
The connection of these words with Christ, the present world Saviour, is
obvious in their implications, and yet they were written in our archives over
seven thousand years ago. Death in Scorpio is of a different nature and is
also described in the same ancient writing in the following words:
“... Ancient One dies by drowning. Such is the test. The waters envelop
him and there is no escape. He drowns. The fires of passion are then
quenched. The life of desire ceases its appeal and to the bottom of the
lake he now descends. Later, he re-ascends to Earth where the white
horse waits his coming. And this he mounts, proceeding towards the
second death” (that is, towards Pisces).
The reference here to Sagittarius is clear. The disciple—after the death of
the personality and after the killing out [215] of desire—goes on towards
Pisces where again he dies “unto an eternal resurrection.” In Scorpio there is
the death of the personality, with its longings, desires, ambitions and pride.
In Pisces there is the death of all attachments and the liberation of the soul
for service upon an universal scale. Christ, in Pisces, exemplified the
substitution of love for attachment. Christianity exemplifies the death of the
personality, with individual and not universal implications; love has been
conspicuously lacking and the controlling colour of Christianity has indeed
been red. It is not Christ's expression but the Scorpio-Mars presentation of
St. Paul. Mars has ruled Christianity because St. Paul misinterpreted the
esoteric significances of the New Testament message and he misinterpreted
because the truth—like all truths as they reach humanity—had to pass
through the filter of his personality mind and brain; it was then unavoidably
given a personal slant and twist and this is responsible for the sorry
historical story of Christianity and the dire plight of the nations today—
ostensibly Christian nations yet swept by hate, ruled by fear and at the same
time by idealism, governed by a fanatical adherence to their national destiny
as they interpret it and “out for blood” as the piling up of armaments
discloses. All these are sixth ray characteristics, emphasised by Scorpio and conditioned by Mars which ever rules the path of the individual disciple,
and today the world disciple, humanity as a whole, stands at the very portal
of the Path. The entire west is at this time under Martian influence but this
will end during the next five years.
Thirdly, Mars governs the senses which are five in number. These senses are
the basis of all human knowledge where that which is tangible and objective
is concerned or inferred. Mars, therefore, rules science and hence the reason
in this present era for the fundamental but not permanent [216] materiality
of science—a materiality which is rapidly lessening as Mars nears the end
of its present cycle of influence. Already, the trend of modern science is
shifting into the realm of the intangible and into the world of the nonmaterial. Hence also the fact that the opposition to occultism is waning and
its day of power approaching. These subtler senses will supersede the
physical senses over which Mars has so long had a successful control, and
hence again the growth in the world today of the psychic senses and the
appearance on every hand of the subtler and more esoteric powers of clairvoyance and clair-audience. This development is inevitable as the influence
of Scorpio and of Mars begins to lessen, as is the case today. The year 1945
saw this influence almost completely vanish, particularly from the astral
plane. Astrologers would do well to remember that the influence of the
constellations, signs and planets, work out upon three levels of awareness—
three descending levels—and are felt first of all upon the mental plane, then
upon the astral plane and finally upon the physical plane. But it is with this
last plane that astrologers are primarily concerned, emphasising happenings
and events and not their conditioning causes. At present, astrology deals
with effects and not with that which is causing them. There is much
confusion over this matter and the horoscopes of the three levels are often
much distorted. A horoscope which could be interpreted purely upon the
mental plane is given a physical interpretation, and thus happenings which
are entirely mental are portrayed as physical occurrences. A clue to this
triple interpretation which astrology must eventually recognise can be found
in the relation of the orthodox, the esoteric and the hierarchical planets and
the rays of which they are the expression. You will see from this how important are the functions [217] of Scorpio and
Mars upon our planet at this time, and you will note also how brief a time
remains in which humanity can (rightly or wrongly) handle its tests. You
will realise also the pressure under which the Hierarchy at this time
struggles now that Martian energy is expressing itself upon the astral plane.
Will the world Hercules lift this problem up into heaven and “elevate the
Hydra” of passion and hate, of greed and aggression, and of selfishness and
ambition up into the region of the soul? Or will it carry the whole matter
down on to the physical plane with the inevitable corollary of world
disaster, world war and death? Such are the problems with which the
guiding Hierarchy is faced.
Scorpio is also most interestingly connected with the constellation, Cancer,
through the influences of the sixth ray, for it should be remembered that that
ray is also expressing itself through Neptune, but in a spiritual and esoteric
manner. Neptune governs Cancer esoterically. The significance is therefore
clear, for Cancer is the sign of birth; it is the door into incarnation and the
sign of generation. Scorpio is the sign of sex and of regeneration, and birth
is ever the intended result of the sex relation. Father-spirit and Mothermatter when brought together produce the Son. The tests and difficulties and
pains of this era are symptoms or indications of the “entering into
manifestation” of the new civilisation and culture. They portend the birth of
the new era for which the entire world waits. This will happen if—speaking
esoterically—the sixth ray energy of Mars is transmuted into the sixth ray
energy of Neptune, for the one is “objective and full of blood” and the other
is “subjective and full of life.”
A great mystery is veiled and hidden in the above relationship, for CancerNeptune is expressive of the seventh [218] ray which rules and controls the
eighth Creative Hierarchy. This is one of the five Hierarchies whose names
are unknown to us and this particular one stands upon the verge of
liberation. At the same time it is closely connected with the mind principle
as it works out through the solar Angels or through the human hierarchy. It
is related to the birth of the fourth Creative Hierarchy in a sense not to be understood by anyone below the stage of the fourth initiation, but it is an
interesting fact to remember for it is in the connection between the sixth and
seventh rays that that potent “desire for incarnation” was aroused which
resulted in the fall of the angels in primordial times. This sixth ray influence
coming from three angles—orthodox, esoteric and hierarchical—and hence
involving both Neptune and Mars—predisposes the race and individual man
as well to become one-pointed disciples in Sagittarius. This latter
constellation is ruled by Mars, bringing the man into control or closer touch
with the lunar lords, the sixth Creative Hierarchy. Students should study
their charts with care, remembering to differentiate between the five
Hierarchies which are the non-manifesting Hierarchies, and the seven
Hierarchies which are in expression now, and of which the sixth Creative
Hierarchy is a part. This Hierarchy, from the larger angle of the entire
twelve hierarchies and not simply the seven manifesting hierarchies, is the
eleventh or the second. The sixth Ray of Devotion is consequently most
powerful in this age or cycle and hence the expression in every land today
of its best and its worst features, of which the intense devotion to material
things and the intense devotion to spiritual values are dramatic instances.
Scorpio and Aquarius are also in a peculiar relation to each other through
the planet Mercury which governs the [219] human family (being the
hierarchical planet in Scorpio), and through Neptune which rules Cancer,
thus governing expression upon the physical plane. In this connection the
Moon is given as the orthodox ruler and the hierarchical rule of Aquarius. I
would here remind you that the Moon is usually regarded as “veiling” or
“hiding” some planet and of these there are three which the Moon may be
veiling. Here the intuition of the astrologer and of the esoteric student must
be called out. These planets are Vulcan, Neptune or Uranus. These three
create and influence certain aspects of the Mother principle, which nourish
and feed the life of the inner divine reality until the time comes when the
Christ child is brought to the birth. They determine or condition the
physical, astral and mental natures, thus creating the personality. They form
a triangle of immense creative potency, upon which theme I will later
enlarge when dealing with the Science of Triangles. The point which I am here making is that through the influence of Mercury and Neptune the group
consciousness of the individual is developed, so that through the tests in
Scorpio and the experience in Aquarius the disciple emerges on the physical
plane into the position of a world server; all world servers are decentralised
workers and are governed by the need and the reactions of the mass or
group. That is one of the reasons why, when in training, disciples are
absorbed into a Master's group which is integrally a collection of individuals
who are imbued with the group idea and are learning increasingly to react to
it. In this world period and in a peculiar manner, as far as the race (Aryan) to
which the Western world belongs, Neptune is known esoterically as the
Initiator. In certain ancient formulas, the great Teacher of the West and the
present world Initiator, Christ, [220] is spoken of as Neptune, Who rules the
ocean, whose trident and astrological symbol signifies the Trinity in
manifestation and Who is the ruler of the Piscean Age. The formula runs as
follows, speaking esoterically: “... the fish goddesses who have leapt from
earth (Virgo) to water (Pisces) unitedly give birth to the Fish God (Christ)
who introduces the water of life into the ocean of substance and thus brings
light to the world. Thus does Neptune work.” This is, however, a great
mystery, revealed only at the time of the second initiation in which the
control of the fluidic astral plane is demonstrated.
Cancer, being the door to incarnation, has a close relation to Scorpio
through Neptune and Mars, both of whom are expressions of the sixth ray
energy. In Cancer, you have the devotion of the soul, developed to such an
extent that the urge to manifest overcomes all other urges, and the processes
of incarnation impose themselves upon the soul. In Scorpio, that same spirit
of devotion (which is based on the sense of duality and the need to go out
towards that which is not the Self) is turned in the reverse direction and the
urge towards liberation and the desire to tread the Path of Return becomes
so strong that the disciple submits to tests, reverses—at tremendous cost and
pain—his position upon the wheel of life and assumes the attitude of the
Observer in contradistinction to that of the Experiencer. Old identifications
cease; new trends toward higher, subtler and more spiritual identifications
begin to appear and then Neptune and Mars begin to play their part. A close study of all the above relations will reveal the fact that four signs of
the zodiac play a dominant part, therefore, in the life of the man who is
working whilst in incarnation with his Sun in Scorpio or with Scorpio
rising. These are: [221]

Service. These are signs 1- Júpiter -8-11. These numbers in themselves are most significant
for they are the signs of will-desire, of human expression, of the Christ
principle and of initiation. There is no need for me to enlarge upon this
fourfold theme and the truth of its implied teaching, for it is obvious and
clear and the history of the soul is sealed up in these numbers.
I would like to touch upon another interesting point which will serve to
demonstrate the potency of Scorpio and its energies in the life of the
disciple. Scorpio is one of the four arms of the Fixed Cross of the heavens,
as you well know. Upon that Cross, the correctly poised man stands right at
the centre where the four arms meet and, therefore, at the point where the
energy of all the four signs and of their ruling planets can pour through him
and evoke the needed reactions, produce the conditions wherein test is
possible and so bring about the necessary reversal of the life currents in the
man's nature and place him upon the reversed wheel. The planets which will
rule and condition him in some aspect or other of his nature are:

Hierarchical From this tabulation, it will appear that the influence of only one ray, that of
the third Ray of Active Intelligence, [222] is missing. All the other rays
pour through, vertically and horizontally, into the man's nature and his
environment. Life, quality and appearance are all tested, but as the entire
experience has to be fought out subjectively and lifted “up into the air”
finally and raised into the world of spiritual values where all problems must
be solved in the light of the intuition and by the soul, the stimulation of the
intellect and the focussing of the disciple's attention upon the physical plane
(the world of material values) is not desirable. Therefore, the influence of
the third ray is omitted or “occultly deflected,” as it is called, except in so
far that the substance of the brain is automatically conditioned by the third
ray which is the subconscious ruler of matter. This pouring in of six
potencies is that which provides the setting and conditions of the tests; all
these ray energies express themselves as the active sub-rays of the ray upon
which the soul of the disciple is found; hence the necessity to ascertain the
ray of the soul, prior to casting the horoscope and setting up the chart.
This brings me to two points about which I would like to speak a word. In
dealing with the horoscope of the personality and with the average nonaspiring man, the astrologer should endeavour to discover the personality
ray from a study of character, of the physical indications, of the emotional
qualities, of the type of mind and the nature of the environment. He will
then be able to lay out a far more useful chart with the orthodox planets
ruling the life. In the case of the horoscope of a disciple, he should do the
same, endeavouring to discover the ray of the soul. The soul ray only sets its
mark and emphasises its quality and nature in the case of advanced people,
and when that emerges clearly, the man is obviously a disciple and the
esoteric planets will then govern his chart. Having determined [223] the ray
of the man undergoing tests in Scorpio, the astrologer can then place the
other rays in relation to him and his probable experience.
The other point to which I sought to refer is the constant use of the word
“relation” or “relationship” and analogous phrases. This is unavoidable for
the reason that the entire Science of Astrology is, in the last analysis, the Science of Relations and there is consequently no use in avoiding the term,
especially when there is no other which seems to meet the requirements as
adequately. Inter-relation, inter-dependence, inter-communication, interplay
—these are words governing the scientific basis of astrology, and they are
beginning to be words in general use today in connection with human affairs
and human conduct. This will be increasingly the case. The preparatory
stages for world fusion, blending and synthesis are present at this time, and
in this fact lies the hope of the world and the surety of the ultimate solution
of the world problem along right lines.
In connection with the vertical and the horizontal life of the Fixed Cross, it
is instructive to note that the vertical life of the man upon that Cross (no
matter in what sign his sun may temporarily find position), is ever
Aquarius-Leo. This indicates that the self-centred individual in Leo learns
the lesson of the Cross and becomes decentralised, group conscious, and
given to service. The horizontal arm is Taurus-Scorpio, indicating that
desire for materiality is finally superseded by desire for the spiritual values,
and this is demonstrated through the tests in Scorpio. Earth and water
(Taurus and Scorpio) must be blended and related and it is this truth
connected with these two signs of the zodiac which lies behind all teaching
upon baptism and purification. The earthly material desires of Taurus must
in [224] due time be brought under the influence of the purifying water in
Scorpio. Baptism by water (a name for the second initiation) needs a
preparatory period of testing and purification, and this the experience in
Scorpio is intended to give. Likewise, fire and air (Aquarius and Leo) must
also be blended and thus the four elements as well as six out of the seven
rays must all play their part in conditioning the man in Scorpio for the final
stages of the Path.
The place of the planets in this sign is also most revealing, and in line also
with the general purpose of the experience in Scorpio, as outlined above.
Uranus is exalted in Scorpio; the power of Venus is lessened in this sign,
whilst the Moon falls. What do these facts symbolically portray? Let me see
if I can make the beauty of these implications clear to you. Uranus is the planet whose characteristics are the scientific mind, which, at
this stage of the disciple's career, means that he can begin to live the occult
life and the way of divine knowledge can take the place of the mystic way
of feeling. It means also that knowledge can be transmuted into the way of
wisdom and of light. This necessarily brings in the will aspect or the
influence of the first ray (Vulcan) blended with the seventh ray (Uranus)
producing the desired manifestation upon the physical plane. Uranus,
therefore, initiates a new order of life and conditions and this—when
developed in the life of the disciple—in its turn produces an understanding
of the causes of things as they are, and the desire to change the old order and
the old orientation into the new. This produces the reversal of the wheel.
This can be seen happening today most clearly in connection with humanity
and with world processes. Carried forward to its logical conclusion, the
influence of Uranus finally produces an unfolded spiritual consciousness in
contradistinction to [225] the human; for this reason, Uranus is exalted in
this sign and assumes a position of power and of directed influence.
Venus , the intelligent mind, has its power lessened in this sign because the
intellect—having been developed and used—must now be subordinated to a
higher power of the soul, the spiritual intuition. The Son of Mind, the solar
Angel, must now manifest as a Son of God. This solar Angel, when in
control, must give place eventually to the Presence. This it has hitherto
veiled or hidden. Venus must wane and the Sun—as a symbol of Deity—
must wax in influence and finally take its place. Such are the symbolic and
esoteric significances.
The Moon is here regarded as functioning in its true nature and, therefore, as
expressing symbolically that which is dead. The Moon here stands for the
personality and, in the final victory in Scorpio, the personality is entirely
vanquished and defeated. Desire is killed, for it is through expressed desire
of some kind that personality demonstrates life, quality, appearance. Ponder
upon this, for in Scorpio the Moon falls and its influence fades out.
Extremes ever meet in the disciple who stands at this midway point or at the
centre of the Fixed Cross in Scorpio. The spiritual imagination, which is the factor of greatest service to man, begins to take the place of the ancient
glamour by means of which we have fabricated the untrue world in which
we appear to live and move and have our being. The self-indulgence which
was initiated in Taurus gives way in Scorpio to the selfless attitude of the
disciple; ambition gives place to the executive activity of the soul, whilst
attachment to personality desires, likes and dislikes is transmuted into the
tenacity of soul purpose. The hidden powers of the soul nature—secret and
misused because misunderstood and misapplied and, therefore, misdirected
—are [226] superseded by the mysteries of initiation, and the practical
understanding of the energies thereby conferred upon the recipient. Such are
some of the great transformations which take place in the life of the disciple
who submits intelligently to the tests and difficulties in Scorpio.
The three decanates and their rulers are given very differently by various
astrologers. One group posits Mars, the Sun and Venus as ruling the
decanates of Scorpio whilst another regards Mars, Jupiter and the Moon as
the three rulers. Perhaps the truth lies in both conclusions, if we view them
from the esoteric standpoint or from that of the undeveloped man. This will
be an interesting point for astrologers to investigate and study. Some day
they will arrive at a clear decision as to the position of the five planets
suggested as ruling the decanates (they agree on one); I cannot indicate to
you the essential truth because a new planet is arising in this sign and it is
for man to discover and rightly place it within the circumference of the
Great Wheel.
The keywords of this sign are significant and illuminating. Deception and
triumph—control by Maya and control by the soul—conflict and peace—
such are the hidden secrets of this sign and these are summed up for all
disciples in the two keywords. Upon the ordinary wheel, whereon the soul is
found, blind and apparently helpless, the Word goes forth in the following
terms: “And the Word said, Let Maya flourish and let deception rule”; upon
the reversed wheel, the soul chants or sings the words: “Warrior I am and
from the battle I emerge triumphant.” LIBRA, THE BALANCE
The sign Libra is one of peculiar interest, but in a most paradoxical manner,
for much of its interest is based upon [227] the fact that it lacks spectacular
interest of any kind—except in the case of disciples or those nearing the
Path. It is a sign of balancing, of careful weighing of values, and of
achieving the right equilibrium between the pairs of opposites. It might be
regarded as the sign in which the first real vision of the Path appears and of
the goal towards which the disciple must ultimately direct his steps. This
Path is the narrow razor-edged Path which runs between the pairs of
opposites and which—if it is to be safely trodden—requires the
development of a sense of values and the power to utilise rightly the
balancing, analytical faculty of the mind. It is also the sign of intuitive
perception and, on the ordinary way of progression around the zodiac, it
comes after the normally drastic experience of the man in Scorpio; this is
usually of such a nature that the instinct to self-preservation has been
aroused to such an extent that in the dire need of the man (not the disciple,
at this time) a call to the soul has gone forth and has evoked response. The
first few faint flashes of the intuition have been sensed and vaguely
recognised. Then follows the experience in Libra wherein a life is spent in
quiet, thoughtful reflection or in a condition of static unresponsiveness; it
may be a life of balancing, of weighing this and that, and of determining
which way the scales shall fall so that in the next sign certain designed
results will occur. The following Virgo life will be either one of a
personality, materialistic nature, lived under the influence of the material
aspect of Virgo, the Mother, or there will be evidenced a slowly emerging
soul vibration, indicating that hidden spiritual life of which the Virgin
Mother is the fore-ordained custodian. As progress is made, recurrently or
cyclically, around the wheel of life, these experiences and vibratory
activities intensify in character until the time comes when the reversal of the
wheel [228] takes place. Then Libra leads on to Scorpio and the active soul
life (active through the medium of the personality nature and not simply on
its own plane) is registered, recorded and noted in Virgo, and balanced and assessed in Libra, eventually bringing about the tests and trials between the
soul and the personality, which latter fights with power and determination to
preserve the status quo of the balanced expression of these two where the
preponderance of the personality influence is not possible.
Libra can also be spoken of in terms of the meditation process as taught
both in East and West. It can, therefore, be regarded as the “interlude
between two activities,” which is the explanation given to that stage in
meditation which we call contemplation. In the five stages of meditation (as
usually taught) you have the following: Concentration, meditation,
contemplation, illumination and inspiration. These five stages are paralleled
in the five strictly human signs of the zodiac:
1. Leo—Concentration—Soul life focussed in form. Individualisation.
Self-consciousness. Undeveloped and average man. Human
experience.
2. Virgo—Meditation—Soul life, as sensed in man, the gestation period.
The stage of the hidden Christ. Intelligent man. Personality, as hiding
the Christ life.
3. Libra —Contemplation—Life of soul and form is balanced. Neither
dominates. Equilibrium. An interlude wherein the soul organises itself
for battle and the personality waits. This is the probationary path.
Duality known. Júpiter . Scorpio—Illumination—The soul triumphs. Experience in Taurus
consummated. Astral glamour dissipated. [229] Soul light pours in.
The Path of Discipleship. The Disciple.
5. Sagittarius—Inspiration—Preparation for initiation. Soul inspires
personality life. Soul expresses itself through personality. The Initiate.
I would here remind you that, though initiation is taken in Capricorn, the
man is an initiate before he is initiated. This is the true secret of initiation.
You have, therefore, the activity wherein the personality grows and
develops, and yet at the same time it veils and hides the hidden “man of the
heart,” which is the Christ, within each human form. You have then the interlude wherein the point of balance is reached between these two and
neither is dominant. The “scales tip back and forth” in either direction or—
as it is sometimes expressed—man swings between the pairs of opposites.
Hence the importance of this sign in the life expression of the man and
hence also its peculiar difficulty; it provides the curious see-saw experience
which proves so distressingly bewildering first to the man who seeks to be
entirely human but finds within himself impediments and urges which drive
him on to something which is higher than the human and, secondly, to the
aspirant or the disciple. His focus of interest and his aim is soul life, yet he
finds within himself that which seeks ever to draw him back to the old
ways, the old habits and the old desires.
This sign is sometimes called “the place of judgment” for it is here that the
decision is made and the die is cast which separate the “sheep from the
goats” or those constellations ruled by Aries (the Ram or Lamb) and those
ruled by Capricorn, the Goat. It really marks the distinction between the
ordinary wheel of life and the reversed [230] wheel. In the days before LeoVirgo were divided into two signs, Libra was literally the midway point.
The situation was then as follows:
Aries. Taurus. Scorpio. Sagittarius. Gemini.
LIBRA
Capricorn. Cancer. Leo-Virgo. Aquarius. Pisces. and in this round of the zodiac (as far as humanity is concerned) you have
depicted the entire history of the race. This involves its mental beginnings in
Aries (the will to manifest) and the start of the outgoing life; you have its
directed desire in Taurus , producing manifestation; then emerges its dual
consciousness in Gemini or the soul-body realisation; the processes of
physical incarnation go forward in Cancer , followed by the dual
development of the soul-body, or the subjective and objective
consciousness, and the God-man in Leo-Virgo . Next comes Libra , wherein
the point of balance is eventually reached between spiritual man and
personal man and the stage is laid for the final fivefold process which is, in
reality, the subjective correspondence to the outer externalisation upon the Path of Outgoing and which is carried forward upon the Path of Ingoing, or
the Path of Return. Then takes place the reversal of the wheel and the
beginning of the new orientation and of discipleship in Scorpio , the
directed, controlled life of the disciple in Sagittarius , initiation in
Capricorn , followed by service in Aquarius and the work of a world
saviour in Pisces and final liberation.
In this world period we have the division of the sign of the Sphinx into two
signs (the Lion and the Virgin, soul and form) because the state of human
evolution and conscious realisation is that of a recognised duality; it is only
at what is called the “final judgment” that another fusion [231] will take
place and Virgo-Libra will form one sign, for then man's sense of
antagonistic dualism will be ended and the scales will have been turned
finally in favour of that which the Virgin-Mother has hidden from
expression for aeons.
This final judgment, as far as this planetary cycle is concerned, will take
place in the next great world cycle and by that time two-thirds of the human
race will have unfolded the Christ principle in one or other of the various
stages of unfoldment and be upon one of the final stages of the path of
evolution; they will be either probationary or accepted disciples or upon the
Path of Initiation. Eventually, in some mysterious way, there will be only ten
signs of the zodiac again; Aries and Pisces will form one sign, for “the end
is as the beginning.” This dual and blended sign is called in some of the
ancient books “the sign of the Fish with the head of the Ram.” We shall then
have
1. Aries-Pisces
2. Taurus
3. Gemini Júpiter . Cancer
5. Leo 6.
7.
8. Mercúrio .
10. Virgo-Libra
Scorpio
Sagittarius
Capricorn
Aquarius Fire and water will then blend, veiling the past which has gone instead of
the future as is now the case. Earth and air will then fuse and in this way the
old prophecy, repeated in the Bible, that “there shall be no more sea” will be proved correct. Air (heaven) will then have “come down to Earth” and
fusion will be established.
In the cosmic sense then and not in the individual sense, the unfoldment of
the cosmic Christ will be manifested for which “the whole creation waits”;
thus will come the consummation of desire as a result of dedicated
aspiration. [232] Then, and only then, will the “Desire of all nations come”
and He for Whom all men wait will appear.
The history of desire is to be found in the four signs of Taurus, Libra,
Scorpio and Pisces.
1. Taurus the Bull of Desire.
(Life.)
2. Libra the balancing of desire.
(Balance.)
3. Scorpio the victory of spiritual desire.
(Quality.) Júpiter . Pisces consummation of divine
desire.
(Appearance.) Material desire rules.
The opposite objective to desire is the scales or
balances.
The soul triumphant.
The “Desire of all nations.” The Cosmic Christ. There is therefore the individual experience in Libra of the balanced life
wherein experiment is made and the consequent tipping of the Scales in one
direction or another until either desire or spiritual aspiration weighs the
balances down sufficiently so as to indicate the way that the man must go at
the time. There is the experi ence of humanity in Libra in which the same
adjustments and experiments are being made, but this time the entire race of
men is involved and not just an individual. This group experience, carried
out upon the mental plane, will only happen when all men are polarised
mentally and will take place and constitute the Judgment day, referred to
above. Of this, the “point of crisis” in Libra and the present world situation
and needed adjustment is the forerunner; this time the balancing is,
however, upon the astral plane and the desires [233] of men are
predominantly in a position of casting the deciding factor, whereas in the
next great cycle it will be the minds of men which will do the deciding. Today, the foremost men of the age—disciples, aspirants and the
intelligentsia—are being tested under the Scorpio experience whilst the
masses are in the Scales; the weight of mass desire will turn them either up
towards spiritual decision or down towards material and selfish ends.
It is because of this balancing quality in Libra that this constellation can be
associated more specifically with the problem of sex than can any of the
others. Sex is usually connected in the mind of the average astrological
student with the signs Taurus and Scorpio. This is probably due to the fact
that the Bull is so frequently regarded as the symbol of the mad urges of the
uncontrolled sex principle and because in Scorpio fundamental tests are
applied. For most aspirants in the early stages, sex does constitute a
fundamental problem. Esoterically, however, it is in Libra that the whole
question comes up and will increasingly come up for answering, and it is in
Libra that the balancing of the pairs of opposites must take place and reach
solution through the activity of the judicial mind and the establishing of a
point of equilibrium between the male and the female principles. This again
(for it is a piece of recurrent symbology) is the problem existing basically
between the Sheep and the Goats, between negative and positive, and
between those who blindly follow either instinct or custom and those who
climb freely where they choose and are self-directed in conduct and attitude.
This self-direction may lead them in either direction upon the wheel of life,
following either selfish desire or spiritual aspiration, but the point to have in
mind is that, judicially and with intent and after due reflection and balancing
of the various ways, they then [234] do as they will and as seems to them
right and desirable. This is of itself of a basic usefulness and thereby they
learn; for all action produces results and the judicial mind weighs cause and
effect more correctly than any other.
It is not my intention here to indicate the solution of the problem of sex.
Humanity will inevitably work it out as the aeons slip away and as the herd
instinct gives place to the premeditated and self-conscious attitudes of the
aspirant and the intelligentsia. I would remind you, however, that the herd
instinct in relation to sex has its basis either in normal and natural animal instinctual desire or in emotional attitudes, and of these the last category are
by far the worst and carry with them by far the more deep-seated seeds of
trouble. They range all the way from the stage of free love and a general
promiscuity to the orthodox narrow and bigoted Christian angle, as that is
normally understood though not in the sense in which Christ viewed life.
This narrow viewpoint and the normal Anglo-Saxon attitude (an outcome of
the teaching of the Middle Ages) regard sex as unusually sinful, ever
undesirable, and as something to be lived down and overcome, and kept
secretly in the background of the Christian consciousness, where it is hidden
as a prurient mystery. This again is due to the influence of St. Paul but not to
the teaching of Christ.
From these attitudes, there has been a violent reaction which is today at its
height and this, in its turn, is both undesirable and dangerous, as are all
violent reactions, for the one is as untrue as the other; it is at the centre of
the Scales or at the hub of the wheel that the true perspective and indicated
action can be seen correctly. When the basic “sex” relation is finally
established and soul and body (negative and positive) are permanently
related in the lives of the world aspirants, then we shall see the right
handling of the [235] world teaching on the subject of physical sex. This
teaching will come from the merging and synthesis of the best views of all
the spiritually minded teachers in both hemispheres, embodying the
experience of the East and of the West, and of the mystical and the scientific
approaches to a mystery which is both physical (requiring scientific
understanding) and mystical (requiring spiritual interpretation). It will
involve the aid and conclusions of the medical profession in order to give
the needed wise, physical instruction and the aid also of the cultural
knowledge of the yogis of India in connection with the energy flowing
through the centres—in this case the sacral centre. Finally, through the
intelligent activity of the judicial and legal-minded men of the world, the
search for a balanced and desirable point of view will come to an end. Out
of the many sexual experiments now going on, the coming generation will
arrive at a point of balance and then, as a consequence, they will tip the
scales in the desired and desirable direction. Of this there is no question of doubt; there is only the point in time and this will be astrologically
determined. Through the legal minds and through right legislation, sex will
be seen eventually to be a proper and divine function and will then be
safeguarded by right education of the young and the ignorant, and the right
action of the young and highly intelligent emerging generation—the
children and babies of today.
The teaching of wrong sexual habits, the example of widespread prostitution
(I use this word in connection with men as well as women), the growth of
homosexuality (not in its rare physiological forms and predispositions but
from the angle of a perverted mentality and an unwholesome imagination,
which today lie behind so much of its expression), the narrow-minded
Christian inheritance of a “guilt [236] complex” where sex is concerned,
and the heritage of diseased and over-or under-sexed physical bodies, have
brought the race to its present chaotic and unintelligent handling of the
important problem. The solution will not be found through religious
pronouncements, based upon an outworn theory, or through physiological
inhibition or legalised license; neither will it come through legislation,
inspired by various schools of thought in any community or nation. It will
be the result of the united activity of the spiritually minded consciousness,
the judicial attitude, the intellectual perception and the steady urge of the
evolutionary process. Nothing can prevent the inevitability of the solution
and the appearance of desirable attitudes and conditions wherein sex can
find right expression.
Libra, as you know, governs the legal profession and holds the balances
between so-called right and wrong, between negative and positive and also
between East and West. This last point of adjustment may seem to you to be
a meaningless phrase, but when the true and right relationship is established
between the orient and the occident (which is not yet the case) it will come
about through the activity of Libra and the work of the legal profession.
Libra has been the “sponsor of the law.” Legislation has hitherto been
engrossed with the enforcing of those negations and those attitudes of fear
which have been preserved for us in the Mosaic code and imposed through the medium of punishment for infringement. This has been a probably
necessary stage for child races and for the preservation of a “nursery
regime” for men. But mankind is reaching maturity and a different
interpretation of the purposes and intents of Libra through the medium of
law is now required. The law must become the custodian of a positive
righteousness and not simply the instrument of enforcement. [237] Just as
we are attempting to eliminate force out of our national relationships, and
just as it is obvious today that the process of drastic penalties has not
succeeded in preventing crime or in deterring people from violent
selfishness (for that is what all crime is), and just as the social attitude (in
contradistinction to the anti-social position of all law-breakers) is being
regarded as desirable and taught in our schools, so it is beginning to dawn
upon the public consciousness that the inculcation of right relations and the
spread of self-control and the growth of unselfishness (and these surely are
the goal, subjective and oft unrealised, of all legal procedure) are the needed
approach to the young.
The influence of Libra should be imposed in childhood along spiritual lines.
Crime will be stamped out when the environing conditions in which
children live are bettered, when physical attention is given in the early
formative years to glandular balance as well as to teeth and eyes and ears, to
right posture and correct feeding, and when there is also a more proper
apportionment of time; when esoteric psychology and esoteric astrology
give their contribution of knowledge to the bringing up of young people.
The old methods must give way to the new and the conservative attitude
must be dropped in favour of religious, psychic and physical training and
experiment, scientifically applied and mystically motivated. When I say
religious, I do not refer to doctrinal or theological teaching. I mean the
cultivation of those attitudes and conditions which will evoke reality in man,
bring the inner spiritual man to the foreground of consciousness and thus
produce the recognition of God Immanent.
I must write no more along these lines. I have enlarged somewhat upon sex
and the judicial system as they are both [238] ruled and conditioned by Libra and this will be increasingly the case. The subject is too vast and too
important for me to do more than indicate lines of approach. A cursory
handling of the problem is of no real usefulness. In this transition period
through which the world is now passing and in this interlude between two
activities—that of the Piscean Age which is passing and that of Aquarius
which is coming in—Libra will eventually rule, and the end of this century
will see the influence of Libra steadily coming into pronounced control and
into a position of power in the planetary horoscope. There is, therefore, no
need for real anxiety.
A certain relationship or configuration of stars—of which one is the star
Regulus, in Leo—will bring about a situation wherein the re-orientation of
the attitude of the legal profession will take place; its functions and duties
will be centralised for the purpose of world usefulness, and in this process
legislation for children will assume great importance and be the motivating
power. This legal step will be primarily advocated by Russia and endorsed
by the United States of America. Before 2035 A.D. such legislation will be
universal in its sphere of influence and control.
All this will come about because Libra rules the present interlude and might
be regarded as “the master of no-man's land,” as one of the Masters of the
Wisdom called it lately.
A study of The Bhagavad Gita and of Arjuna's problem when he sat down
in despair between the two opposing armies will be found most illuminating
in connection with Libra. The great battle which is related in that ancient
scripture of India really took place in the first instance in mid-Atlantean
days and in the sign Libra. The major conflict of this present, Aryan period
is being waged upon a higher turn of the spiral and is under the influence of
Scorpio. [239] That in the past prepared the world probationary disciple,
humanity, for the path of true discipleship. That in the present is preparing
the world disciple to take initiation. During the vast interim between the
Atlantean decisive happening and the present time, a great re-orientation
upon the wheel of life has taken place; since then, several million men have
passed from Scorpio into Libra (symbolically speaking) and there have been “weighed in the balances” and have afterwards refocussed their desire life
towards spiritual aspiration and reinforced their determination to move
forward and thus have returned into Scorpio upon the reversing wheel.
Ponder upon this thought, for this constitutes the real problem for the
masses of intelligent men at this time.
As you already know, Libra is one of the four arms of the Cardinal Cross.
This accounts for our difficulty in understanding the real nature of its
influence. The significance of the energies working out into our solar
system through the medium of the four arms of this Cross, or from the four
constellations, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, can be summed up in the
four words: Creation, Manifestation, Legislation and Initiation . Having
given you these words, their very scope and meaning make it hard for you
to understand.
Cosmically, they mean the activity of Deity when spirit and matter are
brought into a definite relationship and, under divine purpose, produce that
fusion of living energies which will be adequately potent in time and space
to bring that purpose to its desired consummation. This is Creation, or Aries
in activity. They mean also the objective appearing of the thoughtform
which God has thus created and in which is embodied His desire, His will,
His purpose and His plan. This is Manifestation, or Cancer in activity. They
mean again the working out of the plan under [240] spiritual and natural
law which is evolutionary in expression; this is the goal of evolution and its
expression and is steadily revealing the nature of God, for the laws under
which this solar system of ours is governed are expressions of God's quality
and character. This is Legislation, or Libra in activity. They mean, finally,
the processes of initiation wherein, step by step and stage by stage, under
law and through the method of gained experience whilst in manifestation,
the creative plan is realised in consciousness. The unfoldment of the plan is
thus carried forward through a progressed series of beginnings, of
manifestations, and of consummations—all relative in nature but leading to
an absolute consummation. This is Initiation, or activity in Capricorn. All this is on a somewhat vast and incomprehensible scale as far as the human
understanding is concerned.
But consciousness and understanding of the larger purpose which lies
behind the more exoteric intent of the unfoldment of the consciousness in
this solar system, in the planet and in man, has to be grasped eventually
towards the final stages of the evolutionary process. When this
understanding unfolds, then man becomes an initiate, vacates his position
upon the Fixed Cross and begins the relatively slow process of mounting the
Cardinal Cross. Then he becomes a cooperator in the great creative process
and purpose. He begins to create his own body of expression upon the
Cardinal Cross and the impulse of Aries begins to appear to him. As yet he
understands it not. He manifests consciously in the world that which he
intends to carry forward and Cancer then reveals to him its secret. He
becomes his own legislator , ruling his conduct wisely, controlling his
impulses intellectually and then Libra enables him to balance the material
and the spiritual law. When he has done all this, [241] he discovers himself
ready to enter into new and deeper experiments (should I call them
experiences?) and as a participator in the divine plan and as a cooperator in
the divine purpose, he then becomes his own initiator and is thus ready to
take initiation. Such are the paradoxes of the spiritual life. But the secret of
the Cardinal Cross is revealed only to the man who has mounted the Fixed
Cross and gone through its fourfold experience. It is not possible to say
more than what I have said.
Libra is an air sign; there are three air signs in the zodiac and their interrelation makes a most interesting study and well worth the close
investigation of the student as are all these major triplicities. Each of these
signs is to he found in one or other of the three Crosses:
1. Gemini, the Twins . . . . . . . . . .
2. Libra, the Balances . . . . . . . . .
3. Aquarius, the Water-Carrier . . . Mutable Cross . . . . . .
Cardinal Cross . . . . .
Fixed Cross . . . . . . . . Duality.
Equilibrium.
Initiation. These three, therefore, stand for duality—sensed, overcome and resolved
into the synthesis of the great World Server, identified with the Heavenly Man and bringing his contribution, wrested in his experience upon the
wheel of life from the sum total of energy, to the service of the Whole.
Forget not that initiation is but another name for synthesis and fusion.
From another angle, you have:
1. Gemini, the Twins . . . . . . . . . .
2. Libra, the Balances . . . . . . . . .
3. Aquarius, the Water-Carrier . . . Mind . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Supermind . . . . . . . . .
Universal Mind . . . . . Cause of duality.
Cause of synthesis.
Soul. These three signs are pre-eminently signs of the Mind of God as it expresses
itself through man; the lower mind dominates at first, causing the
recognition of the Self and the Not-Self, or the essential dualism which
underlies all manifestation; the higher mind, however, steadily increases
[242] its power and control, producing the balancing of the pairs of
opposites through the illumination which it brings to the lower mind, and
then the Soul, the eternal Son of Mind, becomes the ultimate synthesis,
focussing and relating the universal mind to the two lower aspects of the
Mind of God.
These hints should serve to show you one of the great inter-relations which
exist between the three Crosses, and with these we shall later deal when
discussing them in greater detail in another part of this section on esoteric
astrology.
It is interesting that in the note to Tabulation V both Libra and Gemini are
omitted from the list. This is not an oversight but a point of true significance
and an omission warranting recognition. This omission is based on two
facts: First, that there was a time, as you have heard, when there were only
ten signs, and in those ancient days as in the present time, there was a
divergence of opinion among the astrological scientists; they differed as to
which the ten signs might be and in this connection there were several
schools of thought, but mainly two of importance. One group fused or made
one sign out of Leo-Virgo and perpetuated their belief in the Sphinx; the
other omitted Gemini and Libra altogether. They were of an earlier date than
the latter who in reality had a zodiac of eleven signs. This is a fact of importance to you today. The other point of note and of a relative
importance is that Gemini and Libra are the two strictly human signs; they
are the signs of the ordinary man. Gemini upon the Mutable Cross stands for
man's humanity, whilst Libra upon the Cardinal Cross rules man's subjective
and spiritual life. The other signs in their consummation carry man beyond
the stage of [243] ordinary humanity and produce the following states of
consciousness:
1. Aries and Virgo.—The Cosmic Christ. Universal and individual.
2. Taurus and Pisces.—The world Saviours; i.e., Buddha and Christ.
3. Leo and Aquarius.—The world Servers; i.e., Hercules. Júpiter . Sagittarius and Capricorn.—The world Initiates; i.e., Masters.
5. Cancer and Scorpio.—The triumphant Disciples.
The emphasis, however, on Gemini and Libra as far as humanity is
concerned is on human attainment and achieving the point of balance before
the other attainments become possible.
It is also peculiarly instructive to study the rulers of this sign. From the
angle of orthodox astrology, Venus rules Libra, whilst—esoterically
speaking—Uranus rules. Saturn is the ruler in this sign of that stupendous
Creative Hierarchy which is one of the three major groups of Builders,
forming part of the third aspect of divinity; Their goal is the giving of form
to the Sons of Mind and thereby offering opportunity for sacrifice and
service. A study of the relation of this Hierarchy to that of the human egos,
the fourth Creative Hierarchy, will prove most illuminating and is handled
somewhat in my earlier Treatise on Cosmic Fire . The nature and purpose of
the three rulers will emerge with clarity if this is done.
This sign is consequently closely connected with the third aspect of the
Godhead and hence it is a governing sign and a major conditioning factor
where Law, Sex and Money are concerned. Ponder on this. All the three
divine aspects [244] in themselves are triune and manifest in three manners
or through three lesser aspects and this third aspect is no exception to this
rule underlying all the triplicities which condition the processes of evolution and manifestation. It is through a study of Libra that light upon the third
aspect will come. The first aspect of will or power expresses itself in this
sign as Law, as legislation, legality, justice; the second aspect manifests as
the relation between the pairs of opposites (of which the scales are the
symbol) and upon the physical plane shows itself as Sex; the third aspect
demonstrates as concretised energy and this we call Money. It is literally
gold and this is the externalised symbol of that which is created by the
bringing together of spirit and matter upon the physical plane. The third
aspect is, as you know, the creator aspect and the energy which produces the
outer tangible plane of manifestation—the form side of life.
If students will, therefore, make a careful study of these three—law, sex and
money—as they express themselves today and as they can express
themselves in the future, they will have a picture of physical human
achievement and of future spiritual expression which will be instructive and
most worthwhile. The whole process is accounted for by the activity of the
three rulers of Libra: Venus, Uranus and Saturn.
Venus rules in Taurus, Libra and Capricorn, and is the source of the
intelligent mind, acting either through desire (in the early stages) or love (in
the later stages). In Taurus, this means the mind expressing itself through
intelligent desire, for that is the goal of knowledge for ordinary man. In
Libra, the point of balance or equilibrium is attained between material
personal desire and intelligent spiritual love, for the two qualities of cosmic
desire are [245] brought to the fore in the consciousness in Libra and
balanced one against the other. In Capricorn, it stands for spiritual love,
expressing itself perfectly when the work in Taurus and Libra has been
accomplished. Thus can the golden thread of evolutionary progress be
traced throughout the zodiacal path from sign to sign, and thus the history of
humanity can be seen and its goal visioned. At some later date, the same
golden thread can be traced in connection with the other kingdoms in nature,
but the time is not yet and such a theme would prove profitless and
unimportant. When, however, the consciousness of man is opened up in
such a manner that it can register that which is proceeding and taking place in the three lower kingdoms in nature, then further light and information
will be given. This will take place in a period of human history when Libra
is dominant and the three divine aspects of the third Person of the Trinity,
the Holy Spirit, the Creator—law, sex and money—will give the clue to the
three lower kingdoms. Law, natural law (the externalisation of the
subjective spiritual law) will give the clue to the animal kingdom; sex or the
consciousness of affinity will reveal the mystery of the vegetable kingdom;
money will unveil the secret of the mineral kingdom and all this will come
about through the activity of Venus and when this activity in the three signs
of Taurus, Libra and Capricorn is better understood. This I shall further
elucidate when we come to study the Science of Triangles at a later date.
Suffice it to say here that each of these three signs is related to one of these
three aspects of divine life:
1. Taurus—animal kingdom—law—natural law.
2. Libra—vegetable kingdom—sex—natural affinity.
3. Capricorn—mineral kingdom—money—concrete expression of the
Law of Supply,
[246] and all these form a triangle with Libra at the apex and dominating.
Uranus is the esoteric ruler and is of supreme importance in this sign for the
seventh ray works through this planet and is the embodiment of the
principle of concretion and the materialising of that which is in need of
objective manifestation, through the bringing together of spirit and matter. It
is here that the whole mystery of money lies hid and the creation and
production of money. I would like here to point out to you that it is with the
third aspect of divinity and the third aspect alone that the creative process is
concerned. It is through the relation of the three aspects of the third divine
manifestation—law, affinity and concretised energy—that money is created.
It is here that many mystics and world servers prove futile. They work from
far too high a level and from the standpoint of spiritual incentive. They
normally and naturally (because that is where their focus of consciousness is
placed) work from the standpoint of the second aspect, whereas it is the third aspect (equally divine and equally important) which must be invoked
and evoked. Ponder upon these words. It is not the bringing together of
spirit and matter as occultism understands those terms but the relating of
physical need and physical supply and the bringing together of two
tangibles through the power of the creative imagination. It is for this reason
that so many schools of thought prove so successful in materialising that
which is required and why other schools of thought so signally fail. They
work from too high a plane and have not the ability to carry through . I have
here given you hints which can be fruitful of result if interpreted correctly
and acted upon from right motive, in group formation and with selfless
purpose.
[247] Through this planet, Uranus, Libra is related also to Aries and
Aquarius and it is through Uranus that the great pair of opposites, AriesLibra, are brought into touch with each other in a very deep sense. Through
its activity, an intense interplay takes place, making for the attainment of
equilibrium in Libra of that which had its beginning in Aries. Aries, Libra
and Aquarius constitute therefore another triangle of power which must later
be considered; these triangles will, as I have earlier hinted, dominate the
new astrology in a most interesting manner and condition the charts of those
whose horoscopes are being considered.
Libra is related, therefore, to five signs of the zodiac—Aries, Taurus,
Gemini, Capricorn and Aquarius.
1. Aries . . . . . . . . .
2. Taurus . . . . . . . .
3. Gemini . . . . . . . Júpiter . Capricorn . . . . .
5. Aquarius . . . . . . Beginning . . . . . . .
Desire . . . . . . . . . .
Duality . . . . . . . . .

Incentive . . . . . . . .
Condition . . . . . . .
Initiation . . . . . . . .
Inclusion . . . . . . . . Evolution.
Progress.
Interplay.
Attainment.
Service. This relation is established by the three rulers: Venus, Uranus and Saturn.
These five, with Libra at the point of balance, create one of the six-pointed
stars of evolution and also bring into relation with them three planets which
are peculiarly concerned with the expression of the Christ consciousness in
the world. These three planets are (through the rays of which they are the medium) all to be found upon the first major line of force, the line of will or
power and of purpose and visioned goal.
1. Uranus.—7th Ray of Ceremonial Magic. God the Father . He who
relates. The Source of Duality. He who perceives the end from the
beginning. Spiritual consciousness.
Intuition to Inspiration.
[248] 2. Venus.—5th Ray of Mind. God the Son. The Son of Mind. He who
includes. Egoic consciousness.
Intellect to Intuition.
3. Saturn.—3rd Ray of Intelligence. God the Holy Spirit . He who knows.
Mind. Human Consciousness.
Instinct to Intellect.
It is for this basic reason—founded upon the above triple relationship—that
Libra is the “point of balance” in the zodiac. In most of the other
constellations, at some stage or other, there comes a “point of crisis”
wherein the effect of the energy pouring through the sign (via the ruling
planets) to man is at its highest point of effectiveness. This in time
precipitates the crisis which is required to release the man from the
planetary influences which condition his personality and bring him more
definitely and consciously under the influence of the sign of the zodiac. But
in Libra there is no such point of crisis any more than there is in Aries.
There is only the interlude of balance as a prelude to a more effective and
sensitive progress upon the path. It is the same in Aries. As it is esoterically
said: “Before creation, silence and the stillness of a focussed point.” This
applies to both Aries and Libra—the one in a cosmic and creative sense and
the other in an individual and progressive evolutionary sense.
The following planets and their rays govern the Cardinal Cross of which
Libra is one of the points:
1. Mars . . . . . . . .
2. Mercury . . . . .
3. Uranus . . . . . . 6th Ray . . . . . . . . .
4th Ray . . . . . . . . .
7th Ray . . . . . . . . . Idealism . . . Devotion . . . Struggle.
Harmony through Conflict.
Ceremonial Order, Law or Magic. Júpiter . Venus . . . . . . .
5. Saturn . . . . . . .
6. Neptune . . . . . 5th Ray . . . . . . . . .
3rd Ray . . . . . . . . .
6th Ray . . . . . . . . . Concrete Knowledge or Science.
Active Intelligence.
Idealism . . . Devotion . . . Struggle. [249] Here we have six planets and five rays of energy and the expression
of the two lines of spiritual energy; Love-Wisdom in two of the rays and
planets, and three of the rays and planets upon the first major stream of
energy, will or power. You will note how three of these rays definitely
predispose the Libran subject to concrete understanding, to intelligent will
and to knowledge: the first ray (functioning through the 3rd and 5th rays)
the fifth ray and the third ray. Hence the effectiveness of Libra upon the
physical plane and the power of the developed Libran to project the inner
spiritual purpose or intended will into physical expression. An instance of a
person, equipped to do this, can be seen in H. Plutão . Blavatsky.
In this sign, Saturn is exalted for—at the point of balance—opportunity
comes and a situation is staged which makes a choice and a determination
inevitable. It is a choice which has to be made intelligently and upon the
physical plane, in the waking brain consciousness. It is only now that the
full purpose and the work of Saturn for humanity can reach a point of group
usefulness, for it is only now that humanity has reached a point of general
and widespread intelligence which can make any choice a definite conscious
act, entailing responsibility. Prior to the present time, only a few pioneering
disciples and a handful of intelligent people could be regarded as freely
choosing at the “point of balance” the way that they intend “to tip the
scales.” Today, there are countless numbers and hence the intense activity of
Saturn as we enter into the first decan of Aquarius and hence the same
activity because humanity itself now stands upon the probationary path.
This, Libra governs and controls, therefore the path of choices, of
deliberately applied purificatory measures and the turning point [250]
before Scorpio, which governs the path of discipleship, can properly play its
part.
The power of Mars is lessened in Libra; this is the sign of interlude and
Mars is temporarily quiescent, prior to gathering his forces for a renewed effort in Scorpio or for the “quickening” of the spiritual life in Virgo,
according to which way the wheel is turning for the man.
The Sun “falls” in this sign because again neither the personality nor the
soul dominates in the man who is a pure Libran; a balance is achieved and
thus they esoterically “tune each other out.” Neither the voice of the
personality nor of the soul is heard particularly but, as the Old Commentary
puts it, “a gentle oscillation now proceeds. No strident note is heard; no
violent colouring of the life affects (I know not how else to translate the
original phrases) and no upsetting of the chariot of the soul.” The
significance of the place of the planets in this sign will emerge clearly in
your consciousness when you study them with care and the meaning of
Libra will become definitely formulated in your mind. The characteristics of
this sign are not easy to define or comprehend because they are in reality the
synthesis of all past qualities and achievements and any clear presentation of
the pairs of opposites is difficult to get. As regards man upon the
probationary path or upon the verge of treading it, it might be said that his
characteristics and qualities in this sign are:
BALANCE OF THE OPPOSITES IN LIBRA
Fickleness and variability . . . . . .
Imbalance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Bias. Prejudice . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Dull stupidity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Untrue, showy outer form life . .
Intrigue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Materialistic attitudes . . . . . . . . . A secure and settled position.
Balance.
Justice. Judgment.
Enthusiastic wisdom.
True correct expression.
Straightforward conduct.
Spiritual attitudes. [251] It is the balancing between the pairs of opposites which makes the
man in Libra sometimes difficult to understand; he appears to vacillate but
never for long and often unnoticeably, for there is always the final balancing
of the qualities with which he is equipped.
The rulers of the decanates in this sign are again dual in their presentation
by different schools of astrologers. Sepharial gives us the Moon, Saturn and
Jupiter, whilst Alan Leo posits the controlling planets as Venus, Saturn and Mercury. In this case, as in some others, the truth lies between the two or in
a combination of both. The true rulers of the decanates in Libra are Jupiter,
Saturn and Mercury. I need not enlarge upon their effect except to point out
that the result of the Jupiterian influence is to “open the door of the womb”
in Virgo—a planet which we shall consider when we study that sign of the
zodiac, which is our next undertaking.
The words or keynotes of this sign are so clear and plain that any
elucidation of mine would serve but to confuse the issue. They speak
straight to the heart and without obscurity. To the average man with no
developed spiritual consciousness, the word goes forth again and again
throughout the aeons: “And the Word said: Let choice be made.” The
response eventually comes back as a result of the evolutionary process and
from the soul: “I choose the way which leads between the two great lines of
force.” VIRGO, THE VIRGIN
The sign Virgo is one of the most significant in the zodiac for its symbology
concerns the whole goal of the evolutionary process which is to shield,
nurture and finally [252] reveal the hidden spiritual reality. This every form
veils, but the human form is equipped and fitted to manifest it in a manner
different to any other expression of divinity and so make tangible and
objective that for which the whole creative process was intended. Gemini
and Virgo are closely related but Gemini presents the pairs of opposites—
soul and body—as two separate entities whereas in Virgo, they are blended
and of great and supreme importance to each other; the mother protects the
germ of the Christ life; matter guards, cherishes and nurtures the hidden
soul. The keynote which embodies the truth as to the mission of Virgo most
accurately is “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” There is no clearer or more
adequate definition of this sign than that; I would have you bear it in mind
throughout our discussion upon this sixth sign of the zodiac (or the seventh
if one is not considering the reversed wheel). In all the great world religions, the Virgin Mother appears and this a study
of any book upon comparative religion would prove. I cannot trace for you
at length this universal recognition of the task of Virgo; it is needless for me
to do so as it has been adequately done by many research scholars. I would,
however, point out that four of the names whereby the Virgin is called are
familiar to all of us, and tell us much as a whole concerning the form nature
of which the Virgin is the symbol. The word Virgo itself is a descendant of
and a corruption of an ancient Atlantean root name which was applied to the
mother principle in those far off times. This Virgin was the founder of the
matriarchate which then dominated civilisation and to which various myths
and legends bear evidence and which have come down to us concerning
Lilith, the last of the Virgin Goddesses of Atlantean times; the same thought
is also to be found in the traditionary accounts of the ancient [253]
Amazons, whose queen Hercules defeated, wresting from her what he
sought. This is an allegory, teaching the emergence of the spiritual man from
the control of matter. Three of these goddesses are Eve , Isis , and Mary .
They are of peculiar and significant importance where our civilisation is
concerned for they embody in themselves the symbology of the entire form
nature, which, when integrated and functioning as a whole person, we call
the personality. This personality is (as far as humanity is concerned) the
developed and qualified expression of the third aspect of divinity, that of
God the Holy Spirit, the active intelligent and nurturing principle of the
universe. This aspect we shall study in Leo and see there the unfoldment of
that self-conscious entity and personality which in Virgo becomes the
mother of the Christ child. Eve is the symbol of the mental nature, and of
the mind of man attracted by the lure of knowledge to be gained through the
experience of incarnation. Eve , therefore, took the apple of knowledge from
the serpent of matter and started the long human undertaking of experiment,
experience and expression which was initiated—from the mental angle—in
our Aryan times. Isis stands for this same expression down on to the
emotional or astral plane. Eve has no child in her arms; the germ of the
Christ life is as yet too small to make its presence felt; the involutionary
process is yet too close; but in Isis the midway point is reached; the quickening of that which is desired (the Desire of all nations, as it is called
in the Bible) has taken place and Isis consequently stands in the ancient
zodiacs for fertility, for motherhood and as the guardian of the child. Mary
carries the process down to the plane or place of incarnation, the physical
plane, and there gives birth to the Christ child. In these three Virgins and
these three Mothers of the Christ, you have the history [254] of the
formation and the function of the three aspects of the personality through
which the Christ must find expression. The sign of Virgo itself stands for a
synthesis of these three feminine aspects—Eve, Isis and Mary. She is the
Virgin Mother, providing that which is needed for the mental, emotional and
physical expression of the hidden but ever present divinity. These three
expressions are brought to the needed perfection in Leo, the sign of the
individual, developed self-consciousness and personality unfoldment.
Virgo is, therefore, the opposite pole of spirit and stands for the relation of
these two after they have been brought together originally in Aries and have
produced a recognised duality in Gemini.
I would here remind you of something which may at first serve to add to the
possible confusion already existing in your minds but which lies behind all
that I have given you. We have talked of the two ways of proceeding around
the zodiac:—the ordinary way from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces, and the
esoteric way from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. These refer to human
evolution, which is the only one which we are considering in this treatise.
But in the major involutionary cycle which concerns the mass movement of
spirit-matter, and not the individualised progress of man, the movement is
from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus. The secret of the original sin of man is
hidden in this truth, for a wrong orientation took place at one stage in
human history and the human family went—as a whole—against the normal
zodiacal current, so to speak, and it is only upon the path of discipleship that
right orientation is achieved and humanity swings into the correct rhythm of
progress. I would ask you, therefore, to differentiate between the
involutionary process which affects the great Creative Hierarchies [255] and
the evolutionary processes which affect the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human. This, however, we are not really in a position to study, because
when the evolutionary cycle is upon us, we ourselves are too closely
identified with the process to be able to distinguish clearly between the
cosmic Self and Not-self; we are only as yet learning to distinguish the Self
and the Not-self on a tiny scale in connection with our own unfoldment. It is
only when we are identified with the Hierarchy of our planet and with that
centre of spiritual force which it is the immediate objective of those upon
the path of discipleship to contact that it becomes possible for us to grasp—
on the evolutionary arc—those broad outlines and those major sweeps of
divine energy which are present upon the involutionary arc. It is for this
reason that a study of the zodiac in connection with the subhuman kingdoms
of nature is not as yet possible.
Virgo is, therefore, the cosmic mother because she represents cosmically the
negative pole to positive spirit; she is the receptive agent where the Father
aspect is concerned. In a previous solar system, this matter aspect was the
supreme controlling factor, just as in this solar system it is the soul or the
Christ principle which is of paramount importance. Virgo is, from certain
angles, quite the oldest of all the signs, which is a statement I am quite
unable to prove to you. In that first system, the faint symptoms (if I may use
such a word) of the duality which is a proven fact in this system are to be
found, and this truth is preserved for us in the words that “the Holy Spirit
overshadowed the Virgin Mary.” The life of the third divine aspect played
then upon the ocean of quiescent matter and prepared that substance (over
untold aeons) for its work in this solar system. It is in this system that the
Christ Child, the expression [256] of the divine consciousness and the result
of the relationship of Father-Spirit and Mother-Matter, must he brought to
the birth.
Another sign of the zodiac which is also closely related to the previous solar
system is Cancer; it might be said that Cancer is an expression (in the stage
of great advancement) of the first half of the life cycle in solar system one,
whilst Virgo is an equally advanced expression of the second half. In an
effort to grasp the situation, it should he remembered that the consciousness aspect, as we understand the ability to be aware, was lacking entirely except
in such an embryonic manner that the whole process resembled the stage of
the embryo in the womb, prior to the quickening at the middle point of the
gestation process. It will, however, do none of you any harm to exert the
imaginative faculty and thus get a vague and faint idea of the synthesis of
the great evolutionary scheme which, in a cosmic sense, concerns the
threefold personality of Deity. With this I attempted to deal in A Treatise on
Cosmic Fire .
This is the sixth sign and of it the six-pointed star is the ancient symbol,
portraying as it does the process of involution, and also that of evolution,
carried to the point of balance, expressed for us in the relationship of Virgo
to Libra. You will note, if you consult the dictionary, that astronomically
Virgo is regarded as occupying the place in the heavens where Libra is to be
found. This is all part of the great illusion which astrology finds hard to
grasp. There is a constant moving and shifting in space; the precession of
the equinoxes is both a fact and an illusion. The whole process and its
interpretation is dependent upon the intellectual point in evolution of the
race; the responsiveness of man to the planetary forces and to the influence
of the [257] zodiacal signs is dependent upon man's vehicles of response
and upon the mechanism of reception with which he enters into incarnation.
The heavens, the constellations, signs and planets mean one thing to the
Hierarchy and another thing to the astronomers and still another thing to the
astrologers, whilst they are simply bewildering galaxies of light to the
average citizen. I feel the need to remind you of this and to point out to you
that astronomical facts are only relative as regards the true and factual
nature of that about which scientific pronouncement is made; they are
declarative of life and potency but not as science and the average man
understand them. From the standpoint of esoteric truth, they are simply
embodied Lives and the expression of the life, the quality, the purpose and
the intent of the Beings Who have brought them into manifestation.
As you well know, Virgo is one of the four arms of the Mutable Cross, and
—as you also know—the four energies which constitute this Cross (for the three Crosses are crossed streams of energy) are expressive of the whole
goal of man in four definite stages. This Mutable Cross is sometimes called
“the Cross of Rebirth,” emphasising the constant mutation of which it is the
symbol and also the “Cross of Changing Lives.” It pictorially represents the
four critical points or movements in the span of existence of the soul in
manifestation:
I. Gemini.
1. Essential unrelated duality. The Twins.
2. Sensed and recognised duality through
a. Mass fusion in Cancer.
b. Individual consciousness in Leo.
The stage of Humanity. [258] Gêmeos . Virgo.
1. The period of the hidden germ of spiritual life.
2. The period of the active germ of spiritual life.
a. Gestation in the early stages.
b. The stage of quickened life.
The stage of Probation or Awakening.
III. Sagittarius.
1. Sense of duality ended. Fusion attained.
2. The one-pointed direct life.
The stage of Discipleship.
IV. Pisces.
1. Duality linked in synthesis. Compare symbols for Gemini and
Pisces.
2. The emergence of the World Saviour.
The stage of Initiation.
Throughout this relation and as a result of the steady unfoldment of the soul
principle runs the theme of service. In Gemini , the relation between the great duality of soul and body emerges in which, at this stage, the body or
form serves the soul. In Virgo , matter or substance exchange or interchange
their service and each serves the other. In Sagittarius , we find emerging the
service of the One Life in terms of the service of the Hierarchy, the
planetary expression of the idea of service, whilst in Pisces , there appears
—as a result of the entire evolutionary process—the dedicated, trained and
tested world Server or Saviour. It has been said that Virgo “involves the
service of the immediately present” or in other words that God immanent
evokes reaction from the form side and is thereby served.
[259] The three Crosses—cosmic, systemic and human—are profoundly
interesting in their inter-relation; this we shall discover when we come to
study with care their significance, position and energising effect in the
zodiac—both upon our planet and upon each other. This we shall do in a
later part of this section of the Treatise.
Virgo belongs to the earthy triplicity and an understanding of this triplicity
will also be found illuminating. The three earth signs are Taurus-VirgoCapricorn and they are related to each other in a peculiar way in connection
with the non-sacred planet, our Earth. The relation with which we are
concerned is that of the meeting and fusion of the energies of these three
signs upon the Earth and their effect upon the kingdoms in nature which our
Earth manifests. It might be said that:
1. Taurus.—Incentive behind evolution (Impulse). Desire for experience,
for satisfaction.
The Light of Knowledge
2. Virgo.—Incentive behind discipleship (Goal). Desire for expression,
spiritual desire.
The Hidden Light of God
3. Capricorn.—Incentive behind initiation (Service). Desire for
liberation. Service desire.
The Light of Life All these express desire as it merges into aspiration and in the process brings
light and life to man. In Virgo, the purpose for which form life exists begins
to be realised and the desire for personality satisfaction begins to change
and the desire of man for interior recognition of the indwelling Christ begins
to assume increasing control until the inner spiritual reality is eventually
released from the thralldom of [260] matter and becomes manifest in its
own true nature in the world. Putting the same thought in other terms, the
light of knowledge of which Taurus is the custodian gives place to the light
of wisdom of which Virgo is the guardian, and yields finally to the light of
initiation in Capricorn. All this, however, takes place and must take place
upon what is esoterically called “the radiant surface of the earth,” the plane
of form; the assumption or glorification of the Virgin has not yet taken place
and the raising up of substance is not yet realised. It is interesting to note
that Scorpio establishes the inevitability of this final assumption of matter
into heaven in Capricorn, and this is pre-visioned for us in the story of
Hercules in Scorpio when he raises the Hydra high above his head into the
air.
Virgo symbolises depths, darkness, quiet and warmth; it is the valley of
deep experience wherein secrets are discovered and eventually “brought to
light”; it is the place of slow, gentle and yet powerful crises and periodic
developments which take place in the dark and yet which lead to light. It is
the “blinded stage” which is found in Masonic rituals and which ever
precedes the gift of light. Virgo stands for the “womb of time” wherein
God's plan (the mystery and the secret of the ages) is slowly matured and—
with pain and discomfort and through struggle and conflict—brought into
manifestation at the end of the appointed time. Today it would seem
(curiously and convincingly) that we are entering into the eighth month of
the gestation period; this is almost literally the case where humanity is
concerned for—counting from Virgo to Aquarius, the sign into which we
are now entering—we find that there are just eight signs: Virgo, Leo,
Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pisces and Aquarius, and this is surely the
guarantee [261] that the birth of the new age, of the new consciousness and
the new civilisation and culture is inevitable and sure. I would like to pause here and make one point somewhat clearer in
connection with the passage of human life around the zodiac. This progress
or passage falls into three major divisions:
1. The passage or progress of humanity around and around the zodiac
from Aries to Pisces, via Taurus , until in Virgo-Leo (for these two
signs are regarded esoterically as inseparable) the mass movement
releases the individual to a life of self-conscious progress and a
changed mode of progression around the wheel of life. This lies far in
the past.
2. The passage or progress of the individual man which runs counter to
the mass advance; the individual at this stage proceeds clockwise
from Aries to Taurus, via Pisces . His life is then and for long ages
predominantly anti-social in the spiritual sense; he is selfish and selfcentred. His efforts are for himself and for his own satisfaction and
personality enterprises, and this becomes steadily stronger and
stronger. This is the present situation for the masses.
3. The passage or progress of the re-oriented man from Aries to Pisces,
via Taurus . In this final stage, he returns to the same directed method,
rhythm and measure of the earlier mass movement but this time with
changed and changing attitudes of selfless service, a personality
dedicated to the service of humanity and with a voluntary reorientation of his energies so that they are directed towards the
production of synthesis and understanding. [262] This will be the
situation in the future for the masses.
The astrologer of the future will have to bear these three modes of
progression carefully in mind. Such is God's plan as we at present can sense
it. In this plan Virgo, the Virgin, stands for the womb of time and passes the
personality-soul (Leo-Virgo) through the three above stages or cycles. She
stands also for the womb of form and for the nurturing mother, guarding the
Christ principle within her own material substance until in “the fullness of
time” she can give birth to the Christ child. There are three principal signs
connected with the Christ principle in this world period: 1. Virgo.—Gestation—governing nine signs from Virgo to Capricorn,
including Virgo.
2. Capricorn.—Labour—three signs from Capricorn to Pisces, until the
third initiation, including Capricorn.
3. Pisces.—Birth—appearance of the world Saviour.
In the consideration of these points, another problem for astrology emerges
upon which I have scarcely touched but which is determining in its results.
There must be distinction made between the horoscope of the form and the
horoscope of the inner, living Christ-principle. This will condition the new
astrology but will be developed as astrologers work with the hypotheses
which I have presented. Ponder on these facts connected with the Christ life;
they are familiar to you theoretically but their implications and their esoteric
meaning are abstruse and oft difficult to those who have been reared under
the old order and with the old ideas and approaches to truth. They signify far
more than has hitherto been grasped.
[263] The rulers of this sign are three in number:
1. Mercury.—This is the orthodox ruler. It signifies the versatile energy
of the Son of Mind, the soul. It is interchangeable for the Sun (Son)
and stands for the Mediator or intermediary, between the Father and
the Mother, between Spirit and Matter, and yet is the result of the
union of these two.
2. The Moon (Vulcan).—This is the esoteric ruler. The significance of
this is similar to that of the orthodox ruler. The Moon (or fourth ray
energy) is here seen as an expression of first ray energy, manifesting
through Vulcan. The Moon rules the form and it is the will of God to
manifest through the medium of form.
3. Jupiter.—This is the hierarchical ruler and rules the second Creative
Hierarchy, that of the Divine Builders of our planetary manifestation.
(See the tabulation re the Hierarchies.) This is the seventh Creative
Hierarchy as well as the second, if the five unmanifesting Hierarchies are counted; in the significance of two and seven much of the mystery
underlying these Hierarchies will be revealed.
Through these three planetary rulers the energies of the fourth ray pour,
governing the mind through Mercury and the physical form through the
Moon; the energies of the first ray, expressive of the will of God, begin their
control of the self-conscious man (unfolded in Leo) and the energies of the
second ray, embodying the love of God, pour through into manifestation.
Will, love and harmony through conflict—such are the controlling forces
which make man what he is and such are the governing and directing
energies which use the mind (Mercury), the emotional [264] nature, love (in
Jupiter) and the physical body (the Moon, or esoteric will) for purposes of
divine expression and manifestation. It will be obvious to you that the task
of Mercury in connection with humanity has gone forward most
satisfactorily and has brought humanity to its present point of evolution
upon the probationary path; that the energy of Vulcan is potently making its
presence felt, and hence the struggles going on upon the planet between the
men of will—selfish and ambitious—and the men of good-will who are
desirous of the good of the whole. When the human Hierarchy is fully
awakened to spiritual and not simply material possibilities, then the work of
Jupiter will immediately intensify and this beneficent ruler will lead the
human family into the ways of peace and progress.
Virgo is definitely related, through the medium of the various planetary
rulers, to eight other signs of the zodiac and it is, therefore, with these eight
signs that we are concerned because they produce an inter-related synthesis
of nine signs (including Virgo). In this inter-related numerical synthesis and
fruitful inter-relation lies hid the entire history of human progress and the
secret of the process of divine manifestation. It is of value here to remember
certain points which are:
1. Nine is the number of man. The fourth Creative Hierarchy is in reality
the ninth, if the five unmanifested Hierarchies are included in our
enumeration. The human Hierarchy is only the fourth among the
seven which are in active or manifested expression. 2. Nine is the number of initiation as far as humanity is concerned. There
are:
a. Five major planetary initiations which a man can take. [265]
b. Three systemic initiations of which Christ has two.
c. One cosmic initiation which relates a man to Sirius.
The relation of Virgo to eight signs has, therefore, a definite bearing on
these matters and the nine united potencies play their part in developing the
Christ life in the individual and in the mass of men.
From this group of signs and their attendant constellations, three are
omitted. These are Leo, Libra and Capricorn. These three signs are all signs
of crisis and indicate the progressive influence of the other nine and the
situations which evolve out of their activity. They are the testing points in
the process of the play of energies from the other nine signs as these
energies affect individual aspirants. They are:
1. Leo.—The Crisis of Individualisation . This shows itself in two stages
as:
a. Diffused inchoate power.
b. Personality integration.
It signifies the emergence of personality and preparation for the Christ
experience. It is self-consciousness and the lower synthesis.
2. Libra.—The Crisis of Balance. The emergence of the sense of selfdirection and equilibrium. It is the point of equilibrium between soul
and form. It signifies the emergence of free choice. It is consciousness
of duality and the effort to balance the two.
3. Capricorn.—The Crisis of Initiation . This exists in five stages and
signifies the emergence of the dominating Christ life. It means the
higher synthesis and the control [266] of the Christ consciousness
which is group consciousness.
There are, therefore, nine signs through which potencies pour which are
creative in their effect and which produce changes which are needed in the progress of the soul towards divine expression. You have also three signs of
crisis whereby the point in evolution is determined. In this connection it
should be noted that:
1. Leo-Libra-Capricorn.—Constitute the triangle of the father or will
aspect; they mark points of attainment, through crisis met and
triumphant achievement.
2. Cancer-Virgo-Pisces.—Constitute the triangle of the Mother or matter
aspect, conditioned by intelligent activity. They indicate points of
opportunity of an inner kind where consciousness is concerned, and
therefore you have the recognition of mass, individual and group
consciousness.
A close study of the above ideas will prove fruitful in establishing methods
and relationships; they should also indicate the key which astrologers can
use when seeking to work with mass horoscopes.
As we have studied these various constellations, it will have become
apparent to you that the main function of the planets is to be distributing
agents for the energies emanating from the zodiac as they converge within
our solar system and become attracted to our planet. Students need to
understand more thoroughly than they do that the basis of the astrological
sciences is the emanation, transmission and reception of energies and their
transmutation into forces by the receiving entity . The energies of the
various signs are attracted by the different planets according to their stage
[267] of development and by what is esoterically called “ancient
relationship” between the informing entities of the planets and of the
constellations. This relation exists between beings and is founded on a Law
of Affinity. It is this law of affinity which produces the magnetic pull and
the dynamic response between constellations and planets within the solar
system and between some particular planet and the forms of life upon
another planet and the “impending energies,” as they are called, which are
being received from some major source. The capacity to receive and profit
by the planetary energies (themselves received as emanated from some
constellation) is dependent upon the point in evolution which determines the receptivity and the responsiveness of the mechanism of reception. This
constitutes an unalterable law and accounts for the power of certain planets
which may have hitherto remained undiscovered and which have therefore
had little to do with evolution up to the present, owing to the
unresponsiveness of the forms of reception. The planets, the energies and
forces have existed all the time but have remained ineffective and
consequently undiscovered owing to the non-existence of the needed
instruments of response . They will, therefore, have no effect upon the life
and history of an individual and only become potent and “magnetically
informing” when a man has reached a certain point of development and is
becoming sensitive to higher influences and is in preparation for the
treading of the path. This readiness indicates that his response apparatus (the
threefold personality) is more sensitive than is the case with the average
person, and can respond to a higher range of vibrations than would
otherwise be possible. Herein also lies the distinction between the sacred
and the non-sacred planets. The Lords of the planets (the ray Lives or
planetary Logoi) are also, on Their own level, unequally [268] developed
and some of them are further advanced upon the cosmic path of spiritual
unfoldment than are others; Those Who are definitely upon the Cosmic Path
of Discipleship are regarded as informing sacred planets, whilst Those Who
are upon the Cosmic Probationary Path are expressing Themselves through
non-sacred planets. This point I shall later elaborate when we come to that
part of this section in this treatise which is intended to deal with this matter.
The point I seek to make here is that it is all a question of developed
reception and sensitivity.
Upon the reversed wheel, through the medium of the planetary rulers
(orthodox and esoteric unitedly active), the man upon the path finds himself
responsive to a very wide number of energies, coming to him from many
angles and directions, and hence the difficulties of the man upon the Path of
Discipleship. When he becomes an initiate, this range of vibrations is
rapidly increased and he becomes receptive to those energies which we have
tabulated under the term hierarchical and which have reference to the
twelve Creative Hierarchies. The forces of these Hierarchies (neither planetary nor systemic), then sweep into and through the initiate and
awaken those major group responses which eventually give him systemic
consciousness and make him a world server in Aquarius and a world saviour
in Pisces. A hint is here conveyed to you anent the world period into which
we are now entering and it will be increasingly apparent to you (if you
reflect upon my words) why we are progressing into a sign wherein the
ranks of initiates will be greatly augmented. In the stage of initiation, the
energies of the signs and their constellations (shall I say attendant
constellations—it expresses the situation more accurately than the usual
mode of saying it) come through in a purer form and in a more direct line
than upon [269] the Path of Discipleship and the earlier stages of
evolutionary development. The initiate is responsive to planetary, systemic
and certain cosmic influences and becomes—if I might so express it—a lens
through which “the many lights which are energy itself” can stream and thus
be focussed upon our planet. To these energies, the initiate tunes his
consciousness and thus becomes a planetary server.
The other point upon which I might here touch is that certain of the rays
express themselves through two planets. For instance, the fourth Ray of
Harmony through Conflict reaches us both through the Moon and through
Mercury, whilst the first Ray of Will or Power reaches us through Vulcan
and through Pluto. The real reason for this is one of the secrets of initiation
and is hidden in the destiny of the fourth Creative Hierarchy and in the willto-manifest of the Lord of our Earth, Who is Himself upon the third Ray of
Active Intelligence; of Him it is said that “when the third great energy is
related to the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the mystery of the perfected Seven
will be understood.” One of the more obvious of the significances of this
statement is to be found in the unfoldment of intelligence and love in the
initiate, at which time of manifested expression and at the last major
initiation, he will be responsive to the synthesis of energies which emanate
from the “seven spirits before the throne of God.” These are the
representatives of the seven Rishis of the Great Bear and Their other pole,
the seven Sisters of the Pleiades, symbolically recognised as the seven
wives of the Rishis of the Great Bear. Here again, in relation to our solar system, do we find another great triangle of energies, of which the focal
points on our Earth are the seven Spirits before the Throne. With this
triangle we shall later deal; I simply want to refer to it here: [270]
1. The seven Spirits responsive to the seven sacred planets. They are:
a. Expressions of divine life upon the Earth.
b. Focal points for the Lords of the seven rays.
c. Rulers of the seven planes of consciousness and manifestation.
d. Representatives because responsive to
2. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear Who are:
a. Expressions of the life of the One About whom Naught May Be
Said.
b. The positive focal points for the seven major cosmic energies.
c. Rulers of the seven Creative Hierarchies.
d. Related as positive poles to
3. The seven Sisters or the seven Pleiades who:
a. Are expressions of the dualism of manifestation in their relation to
the seven Rishis.
b. Provide the negative pole to the positive aspect of the seven Rishis.
c. Fuse with the positive energies of the Great Bear and, unitedly,
work through seven of the zodiacal signs.
Here again the complexity of the forces playing upon our planet and
increasing in their number and their potency as the vehicles of response
upon our planet become more highly developed and sensitive and are,
therefore, capable of a truer reaction and a more rapid response to the many
forces impinging upon our planetary forms of life. It has been remarked by a
profound astrological expert Who [271] works with the Masters of the
Great White Lodge that “when humanity comprehends the distinction
between the signs and the constellations, understands the nature of the
polarity of energies and responds to the three cosmic Realities, the twelve
cosmic Energies and the seven planetary Impacts and the interplay of the twelve Creative Hierarchies, then and not till then, will a radiant light be
seen and the destiny of our solar Logos be finally determined.” Behind this
statement are to be found three meanings: one for average intelligent man,
another for disciples, and a third one for initiates above the third degree.
As I earlier pointed out to you, the sign Virgo is related to nine
constellations and in this fact lies both prophecy and guarantee. That which
this sign veils and hides is potentially responsive to nine streams of energy
which—playing upon the life within the form and evoking response from
the soul—produce those “points of crisis” and those “moments of
demonstrated development” to which we have referred in speaking of LeoLibra-Capricorn.
Through Mercury, Virgo comes into close relation to three constellations—
Aries, Gemini, and Scorpio. Here again is a triangle of energies of great
importance in the life of the Christ-child which Virgo guards and nourishes
and hides within herself. Through Aries and Scorpio, the Christ-life and
manifestation is integrated with that of the fourth Creative Hierarchy; herein
lies a great mystery which is concerned with the dual manifestation of the
Christ principle both in form and—upon its own plane—through spiritual
manifestation; it is here also that the true significance of the words found in
The Bhagavad Gita appears when Krishna (the Christ principle) says to
Arjuna (the world disciple, or developed form aspect): “Having pervaded
the entire universe with a fragment of myself, I remain.” [272] There is here
an esoteric reference to the essential identity of Son with the Father, the
“undying One,” and with the eternal Mother; that is, with spirit and matter.
This is the fundamental mystery of Virgo and will be revealed when the
energies pouring into Virgo from Gemini, via the planet Mercury, have done
their destined work; for Gemini is an expression of the fourth unmanifested
Creative Hierarchy—one of the higher group of Lives which stand just
beyond the seven Who condition our systemic lives. These Lives have
achieved Their goal, but Their energies are still directed towards and
focussed upon our planet. They are not unmanifested in the case where such
developed planets as Uranus, Jupiter or Saturn are concerned. In this triple relation of three major constellations, one clear understanding
characteristic can be noted, and that is their essential duality—the effect of
which is obvious and so dramatically present in Virgo. Aries sees the
beginning or initiation of the relationship between spirit and matter. Gemini
is definitely a sign of duality and signifies the relation of these two major
energies in the human or fourth Creative Hierarchy; this dualism is
emphasised in a still more intimate and comprehensible manner in Scorpio ,
in which the note of the evolutionary cycle which it dominates is “the Word
made Flesh.” It is the sign wherein the Christ demonstrates His control over
matter in the guise of the triumphant disciple. Spirit and matter (Aries), soul
and body (Gemini), the mother and the child (Virgo), the Word and the
Flesh (Scorpio)—here are the four signs of creative dualism and interrelated evolution presented and descriptive of the potency and objectives of
the fourth Creative Hierarchy. When Mercury, the divine Messenger, the
principle of illusion and the expression of the active higher mind, has
performed his mission and “led humanity into the [273] light” and the
Christ-child out of the womb of time and of the flesh into the light of day
and of manifestation, then the task of that great centre we call humanity will
be accomplished. Ponder on this for the significance of esoteric astrology
will emerge more clearly in your minds if you can understand this fourfold
activity of Mercury and the inter-relation of these four signs of the zodiac—
connected as they are with the logoic Quaternary.
It is in this sign also that the Moon in its own right of antiquity and of
ancient thoughtform control, and also as veiling both Vulcan and Neptune,
connects the force of Virgo with the energies of Taurus, of Cancer and of
Aquarius. This is of peculiar importance for it relates the form building
aspect with the consciousness aspect which, at a high stage of development,
produces the manifestation of the Christ principle or Christ-child. It has
been said esoterically that four of the names by which the Christ Avatar is
ever called are:
1. The Desire of All Nations
2. He Whom the masses sense or He Whom they
anticipate Taurus
Cancer Fixed Cross.
Cardinal Cross. 3. He Who is, for Her, the purpose of existence Júpiter . He Who shows the light and gives the water Virgo
Aquarius Mutable Cross.
Fixed Cross. All these signs indicate forms of consciousness, which are conditioned and
manifested by the energies of these signs, performing cyclically and
ceaselessly their appointed task. They, therefore, are primarily concerned
with the stage of discipleship and the manifestation of a solar disciple.
Hence the two energies which come from the Fixed Cross. This is
consequently one of the intermediate crosses which relate the major three
and there are many such.
[274] Virgo is related to Taurus through Vulcan which brings in what might
be called the endurance aspect of the will-to-be which carries the incarnated
Son of God through the experiences of the dark time wherein the personality
becomes the Mother in the stage of gestation, through the period of infancy
upon the physical plane and through the stage of adolescence until the
initiate attains full maturity. This necessitates persistence, endurance and
continuity of effort and is one of the characteristics imparted or stimulated
by energies pouring from Vulcan. You can realise that these are first ray
attributes and are the reverse side of those usually emphasised, namely,
death or the activity of the Destroyer aspect. Taurus is an expression of the
third unmanifested Hierarchy and of this Hierarchy we know nothing
beyond the fact that it is concerned with the light which liberates from
death. Therefore, you have:
Taurus—Illumination.
Vulcan—First ray or endurance.
Third Creative Hierarchy—Liberating Light.
Virgo—The Christ-life, latent and unexpressed (as is the 3rd Creative
Hierarchy).
The Moon—The form nature, the substance of the flame which lights the
way.
A vast field of psychological research in connection with all the
constellations, the planets and Hierarchies is indicated above, but it is of too vast a nature for me to consider in this treatise. It will constitute the
astrology of the future and will begin to be understood when group
awareness and continuity of consciousness are established among men.
However, as a form of mental gymnastics and as indicating possibilities, the
concept is of use to you, for it widens your [275] horizon and indicates the
marvellous scope of the divine plan and the synthesis underlying
manifestation.
Neptune is as you know, the God of the waters, and the term “water” covers
many angles of the esoteric wisdom, such as:
1. The whole concept of matter—universal and itemised.
2. The “waters of substance.”
3. The ocean of life. Júpiter . The world of astral glamour and reaction.
5. The astral plane as a whole.
6. The desire and the emotional nature.
7. The world of focussed incarnation for the masses.
8. Mass existence, as in Cancer.
Of all these attributes or conditions of the feminine pole in existence (the
material aspect), the constellation Cancer is outstandingly symbolic. It
precedes Leo, the sign of individuality and of self-conscious effort, and is
concerned with the slow rhythm of mass life—either instinctually active or
the reactions of an imposed consciousness which is a result of chosen
experience after initiation. It connotes mass life, leading to group life after
the experience of initiation, for which its polar opposite, Capricorn, stands
and which finds full expression in Aquarius which completes the experience
of Leo and fuses it with that of Cancer and Capricorn. These six signs:
Cancer . . . . . . . . . .Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . .Virgo
Capricorn . . . . . . . .Aquarius . . . . . . . . Pisces
form another six-pointed star of profound significance which is the
subjective counterpart of the six-pointed star (the interlaced triangles) which we call King Solomon's seal. This interlacing of the two above triangles
constitutes what [276] is called a triangle of humanity and—under the
theories of the Science of Triangles—it concerns the relation of the
individual to the mass of humanity and of the disciple to the group. These
triangles warrant most careful study. It is the planet Neptune which is
predominantly active in bringing about such an activity in Cancer that
adequate momentum can be set up which will produce progress (through the
intervening signs) to Aquarius.
I would like here to add something more to the teaching about the wheel of
life and its reversed motion which occurs at a particular stage of evolution. I
want to call your attention to the fact that the difficulty of the problem and
the intensification of the life of conscious duality which marks the earlier
stages of the Path of Discipleship, up to and immediately preceding the third
initiation, is based upon the wheel of the zodiac contributing its influences
to the life of the form nature in a normal manner; the myriads of lives which
constitute the form are conditioned by the signs of the zodiac proceeding in
its normal manner—clockwise, due to the precession of the equinoxes,
whilst the life of the disciple, focussed in the soul consciousness, is
governed (or should I remark, should be governed?) by the wheel,
proceeding anti-clockwise. Both motions are in potent opposition and,
symbolically speaking, produce eventually that “tearing asunder” which
always precedes initiation and illumination and which is testified to by all
the mystics and initiates. This is in reality that which produces the
destruction of the veil of illusion and is symbolically referred to in The New
Testament as “the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom.” This constitutes the result of the dual activity of the Great Wheel.
It precedes the dark night of the soul wherein the man stands pendant
between heaven and earth and then cries: [277]
“Where is the one God Who has forsaken me? He is nowhere to be
seen and all other gods have gone. I stand alone, bereft yet unafraid. I see
the dark of form; I see the dark of distant spirit. And all the light of soul seems gone.” Then comes the cry triumphant: “I know I am the Light of
God. There is naught else.”
Through the Moon and also through Jupiter, Virgo is brought into
relationship with Aquarius which means, in this case, with the seventh
Creative Hierarchy, or with the atomic substance out of which the dense
body of manifestation has to be constructed if the Christ life (which the
Virgin nurtures) is to be brought to successful manifestation. The cause of
manifestation is, esoterically speaking, the stimulation of the “dead lives”
(the so-called inorganic substance) into activity and into usefulness to the
positive Christ life, which is the agent of the stimulation. Hence the Moon is
the symbol of the response of the dead lives to the outer spiritual impact.
The central idea of occultism that even the smallest atom of substance has in
it the germ of that which can respond to spiritual energy is preserved for us
in the teaching anent the influence of Jupiter, the second ray agent of the
Christ spirit.
In connection with Jupiter, as might be expected from a study of the rays,
Virgo is related both to Sagittarius and to Pisces. This is an exoteric impact
but produces a constant stimulation of the life of the indwelling Christ.
Sagittarius rules or conditions (for that is what the word means) the activity
of the lunar lords who build the body of man out of their own substance. It
will, therefore, be obvious to you why, when a man begins the one-pointed
activity of Sagittarius and becomes the earnest disciple, it [278] is possible
for him to rule his personality and to govern it so that eventually it becomes
the vehicle of the soul. It accounts also for the reaction of the personality
against this control. It is because of facts such as these that astrology is
bound to become one of the major sciences of the future, and when this is so
the control of the personality will be scientifically carried forward; full use
will be made of the planetary influences and the energies coming from the
signs as they cyclically make their appearance, and special effort will be
made, for instance, to gain certain aspects of control during the month in
which the Sun is in the sign Sagittarius. The relation existing between Virgo and Pisces (between the Virgin Mother
and the Fish Goddesses) is well known, for they are polar opposites and
their functions are interchangeable in a peculiar manner. In the revolution of
the ordinary wheel, Aries and Scorpio mark the beginning and the end, and
consummate in the rounded out and equipped personality. They are,
exoterically, Alpha and Omega. In the life of the disciple, Virgo and Pisces
stand in the same relation. Pisces consummates the work carried forward in
this major world cycle. Some idea of the creative story above indicated can
be gained if the tabulation of the nine constellations with their signs is
studied.

MUTABLE CROSS. One point of interest emerges: All the four arms of the Mutable Cross are
represented in this interrelation, indicating [279] the completed activity of
the Mutable Cross or of the preparatory stage of evolution which has
successfully prepared the man for mounting the Fixed Cross. The
personality is prepared to be the mother of the Christ.
If we consider the two solar systems (the past and the present) as a unity, it
might be said that:
1. The Mutable Cross governed the first solar system. In that system and
in this solar system, and to humanity en masse, this Cross rules or
governs the path of probation (which in reality is the entire life
experience, prior to treading the path of discipleship).
2. The Fixed Cross governs the present solar system and corresponds to
the path of discipleship. 3. The Cardinal Cross will govern and rule the next solar system and in
this system governs the path of initiation, which is trodden by the
flower of the race.
The fact that all four energies of the Mutable Cross, three of the Fixed Cross
and two of the Cardinal Cross pour into the sign Virgo in relative degrees
and potencies indicates the fundamental importance of this “sign of
reception” as it is called. All nine energies are required to bring a man to the
point where the world and influence of the two solar systems have done
their task in:
1. Preparing the vehicle of reception and protection, which is the
personality, the form, the self-conscious man.
2. Bringing into manifestation thereby the hidden man of the heart, the
Christ within, the soul, the group conscious man.
What will be the objective and the consummation of the activity of the
Cardinal Cross during the next solar system [280] is hidden in the revelation
which comes to the man who has taken the third initiation. It is connected
naturally with the Spirit or first aspect of divinity, or with the Monad and
with the expression of the divine consciousness. Until a man has, however,
taken this initiation, he profits not from anything that I could tell him in this
connection. For its impartation also, words are useless and in fact do not
exist.
As I have told you, Virgo is regarded by the esoteric teachers of the
Hierarchy to be identified with the third aspect of divinity, with the mother
principle and is believed to be the director of the energies, developed and
recognised in the first solar system. It is for this reason in this solar system
that Virgo is subjected predominantly to the influence of the second, fourth
and sixth ray energies through Jupiter (second ray) the Moon and Mercury
(fourth ray) and Neptune (sixth ray). The Moon and Mercury together
indicate the activity of the higher and lower mind and are, therefore, related
to the third Ray of Active Intelligence which controlled the first solar
system. There is consequently only one planet, Vulcan, which is distinctly and purely first ray energy. These are points which advanced astrologers
will later elaborate but which at the present time mean little.
There is another point in connection with the planetary influences which I
would like to mention here because it emphasises again the synthetic
position of Virgo and its contribution as a major focal point for the
distribution of energy to the fourth Creative Hierarchy. Jupiter rules four
signs and each of them represents a different element out of the four which
are expressing themselves in the three worlds of human evolution. The
following tabulation will make this somewhat clearer: [281]
Virgo Pisces Sagittarius Aquarius Earth
Hidden Christ Water
Hidden Saviour Fire
Hidden Master Air
Hidden Server. Jupiter—ruler and the conveyor of EXPANSION
In this sign, Virgo, the place and the mode of expression of the planets are
of paramount interest, though most esoteric in implication and most difficult
to understand.
Mercury is exalted in this sign because the mother is necessarily ruled by
her son, the Son of Mind who is also the Son of God. Of this son, she is the
protector and is responsible for his development and slowly acquired
experience. Mercury, being the Messenger of the Gods and the Agent of
Their applied control, is therefore the agent of the third aspect (active
intelligence) from one point of view, and of the second aspect (lovewisdom) from another. He is regarded as embodying in himself both these
aspects of the mental principle, the expression of the concrete and the
abstract mind of God. The lower concrete mind was unfolded in the first
solar system and the higher abstract intuitional mind, the pure reason, is
unfolding in this system. Mercury is the synthesis of manas-buddhi, mindwisdom which expresses itself through the human soul; Mercury rules the
bridge or the antahkarana. In Virgo, Mercury reaches his full power, for
Virgo is intelligence and the hidden Christ is wisdom or pure reason. Venus, pure love-wisdom, falls into generation in this sign and occultly
“descends to earth” and stands (as The Secret Doctrine has so carefully
pointed out) for the gift of mind and of divinity, embodied in the Son of
Mind and thus for the descent of the Christ principle into generation or into
matter. Virgo and Venus are together two aspects of intelligence. The
symbolism of the descent of Spirit into [282] the womb of the virgin mother
is preserved for us in the astrological fact that Venus falls in this sign;
esoterically, she disappears from view and vanishes into the darkness.
Neptune, the expression of the sixth Ray of Idealistic Devotion, is naturally
rendered more impotent in this sign and simultaneously his “power is
lessened,” for the drive and urge of devotion and desire give place in this
powerful sign to the natural processes of form production and to the silent
activity which is going on within the womb of time and space.
Jupiter, in spite of its latent power, is also “lessened” in influence at this
time because of the second principle or second aspect of divinity, the Son or
the germ of the Christ Who will come, the Son of Mind, descends into the
depths and is temporarily veiled or hidden. I would recommend to the
astrologers of the future a careful investigation of the falls, exaltations and
the diminution of power which take place within any zodiacal sign; the
whole problem must be viewed in a large manner and not so specifically
from the angle of personality horoscopes. When the planets are rightly
related to the rays which they are expressing, then the wider theme of the
soul's life will emerge; these condition the personality but not in the same
sense as material circumstance (physical body and material environment)
condition the mass of men. Ponder on this.
In connection with the decanates, I would point out that what I am in this
treatise constantly emphasising is that the astrologer needs to study the
horoscope of an individual from the angle of his place upon the wheel of the
zodiac and to consider which way he is going. Is he progressing around the
wheel as a personality or is he moving forward as a soul? The conflict to
which all disciples are subjected can be traced to the fact that the form life
of the disciple [283] is influenced in one way by the wheel, and the consciousness aspect in another way or in the reverse direction. The disciple
enters the sign under the influence of that decanate which is for him the first
but which is the third for the ordinary man. This is interestingly and
practically instanced by the constellation which we are now entering. The
three decanates of Aquarius, from the angle of the disciple, are Saturn,
Mercury and Venus. It is in this sequence that they affect him and carry him
forward on his desired way, thus giving opportunity through conflict, the
illumination of the mind and eventually the achievement of brotherly love
which is wisdom. Ordinarily speaking, the mass of men would pass through
the sign via Venus, Mercury and Saturn, for the undeveloped man is
influenced by those qualities which can be best described as instinctual
mind or affection (Venus), which is brotherly love in embryo; by the slow
unfoldment of the mind through the activity of Mercury; finally, as the result
of this unfoldment, conflict supervenes and Saturn offers opportunity to
suffer and, through suffering, to learn to choose rightly, to analyse correctly
and to decide upon the higher values. These points must be carefully
considered by the astrologer. But at this time, we are at a point of crisis and
the problem takes wider implications, for the reason that, for the first time in
its history, humanity is beginning to mount the Fixed Cross of the disciple,
thus reversing its progress upon the circle of the Zodiac. Humanity—as a
whole and owing to the large proportion of aspirants and thinking idealists
—is entering Aquarius, via the open door of Saturn. At the same time, a
very large number of men are in the non-thinking instinctual stage and their
consciousness is predominantly Atlantean. These enter via Venus and hence
the conflict.
[284] According to Sepharial, the three decanates into which Virgo is
divided are governed by the Sun, Venus and Mercury, whilst Alan Leo gives
us Mercury, Saturn and Venus. I would remind you here of a point which is
oft forgotten by astrologers; this is that, in the case of the disciple, Mercury
and the Sun are interchangeable terms. When the disciple becomes aware
that he is himself Mercury, the Son of Mind, and therefore one with the
universal Christ, the “Sun and yet the Son of God” (as it is esoterically
called), he is then an initiate. Therefore, Leo's assignment of rulers is the truly esoteric one. When the disciple knows Saturn as the God who offers
opportunity and does not only feel him to be Deity who brings disaster, then
he is on the path of discipleship in truth and in deed and not just
theoretically. When Venus is the source of wisdom and the expression of the
transmutation of the mind into intuition and of intellect into wisdom, then
he is ready for initiation. He is rapidly achieving liberation. The weakness
of the rulers of the decanates as given by Sepharial lies in the fact that as
both Mercury and the Sun are one, the choice is therefore redundant; he
omits Saturn and because of this omission, esoterically speaking, the “door
is not open.”
Again, the keynotes of this sign convey their meaning clearly and there is no
need for me to elucidate. On the ordinary wheel, the command goes forth in
the following words which institute the activity of Virgo: “And the Word
said, Let Matter reign.” Later, upon the wheel of the disciple, the voice
emerges from the Virgin Herself and she says: “I am the mother and the
child. I, God, I, matter am.”
Ponder upon the beauty of this synthesis and teaching and know that you
yourself have said the first word as the soul, descending into the womb of
time and space in a far [285] and distant past. The time has now come when
you can, if you so choose, proclaim your identity with both divine aspects—
matter and Spirit, the mother and the Christ. LEO, THE LION
Passing as we are into the Aquarian Age in which the spirit of Aquarius will
be exemplified in its universality and its sense of “general distribution,” it is
inevitable that a point of crisis should be reached. The true Leo type must
react in a new and unique manner to the proffered opportunity, and when I
say type, I refer to those people whose sun is in Leo or who have Leo rising.
The reason for this is that Leo is the polar opposite of Aquarius, and the
interplay of energies between these two is far more potent than at any
previous time in racial history. This is a fact which you are not in a position
to verify, but I make it as a statement of fact. It is because of this fact that you have the appearance of the dictators in different countries at this time,
and it is because of this fact also that in this present cycle (the ante-chamber
of the New Age) you have the pronounced attitude of these dictators—an
attitude which is so often ignored but which has real racial value. It is the
attitude which leads to a synthesis of the national life, aims and intentions.
A typical instance of this attitude is that of Hitler. No matter what may be
our personal opinion of him, there is no question that he has unified,
produced fusion and blended together the various elements in the German
race. This activity is Aquarian in nature but in its lowest and most
undesirable aspect. It is also of the nature of Leo, for the people who can
produce these results have necessarily to be intensely self-aware. This is the
major characteristic of the Leo person. What [286] part Leo may play in the
personal horoscope of Hitler I do not know, for I have not investigated it,
but it plays a very prominent part in the horoscope of his soul.
I would suggest to modern astrologers that they cast the horoscopes of the
dominant world figures at this time, with the planets which I have given you
as the esoteric rulers; all advanced people and those of major importance are
on or nearing the path of discipleship and the influence of the esoteric
planets is becoming, therefore, increasingly powerful. It might prove most
illuminating and teach them much. The tendency to fusion, blending,
amalgamation, and the spiritual counterpart of this unity is stronger today
than heretofore and the types which produce this exoterically must have Leo
somewhere in a prominent position in their horoscopes or the Sun
controlling in some important house. If the horoscopes do not prove this, it
is because the exact hour, moment and day of birth has not been accurately
ascertained.
This sign, Leo, is the fifth sign of the zodiac which indicates that it is part of
the mysterious number, ten—the number of perfection, a relative perfection,
prior to entering into a new cycle of progress. This links Leo consequently
with Capricorn, the tenth sign of the zodiac, for it is the processes of
initiation which make the self-conscious person the group conscious
individual. I am choosing these words with care and fore-thought. Upon the reversed wheel, this is the eighth sign, the sign of the Christ and of the
indwelling Reality; it therefore marks—in this manner—a new cycle. When
self-consciousness is born (as at the moment of individualisation) a new
cycle begins. This numerical significance links Leo with Scorpio (the eighth
sign of the Zodiac) in an effective manner and you have, therefore, the
triangle of Leo-Scorpio-Capricorn involving [287] humanity and indicating
the three important crisis points in man's career:
1. Self-consciousness or human awareness. Unity—Leo.
2. Consciousness of warring dualities. Discipleship—Scorpio.
3. Group consciousness as an initiate. Unity—Capricorn.
This sign is a fire sign, and it is the pre-eminent fire sign at this time. The
Sons of Mind, the self-conscious Sons of God, are above everything else the
Sons of Fire, for our “God is a consuming Fire.” There is in them that
peculiar quality which can burn and destroy and so eradicate all that hinders
their essentially divine expression. I would have you bear in mind the
purificatory nature of fire. There are two elements in nature which are
connected in the public consciousness with the thought of purification—one
is water and the other is fire. It is in this connection that the water signs,
Cancer—Scorpio—Pisces, are interesting, and the fire signs, Aries—Leo—
Sagittarius, warrant study. Fire always carries forward esoterically that
which water has begun.
In Cancer , the purificatory waters of experience begin their beneficent
work. This is begun upon the Cardinal Cross because that cross deals only
with wholes and, therefore, with mass experience.
In Scorpio , the purificatory waters of testing and trials are applied. This
takes place upon the Fixed Cross and their effect is drastic in the extreme.
In Pisces , the waters of purification are applied through daily life and the
processes of incarnation; they apply to the “fish swimming in the waters of
matter and finding there its sustenance.” This is upon the Mutable Cross of
[288] ordinary material existence and experience. Thus the influence of the
three crosses is brought to bear upon the incarnated Son of God upon the wheel of ordinary life and in the usual order. Upon the wheel reversed, the
fire takes the place of water and burns away all dross. Purification of the
entire nature is thus achieved gradually, and the man becomes sensitive to
the influences which can be brought to bear upon him when the fiery
triplicity plays its part and the influence of Aries-Leo-Sagittarius begins to
re-orient him towards universality, self-consciousness and one-pointed
attitudes. As we go on with our study, the significance of this statement will
increasingly appear. I am hinting at matters of spiritual and esoteric
importance because this sign, Leo, is of paramount control in the life of the
aspirant. He has to know himself through true self-awareness before he can
know that divine spirit which is his true Self and know also his fellowmen.
Leo is a part of the Sphinx, and upon this I need not enlarge as we have
touched upon this elsewhere. This is a great mystery. Virgo and Leo together
stand for the whole man, for the God-man as well as for spirit-matter. It is
important to have this in mind, for when the nature of the world is revealed,
then the mystery of the Sphinx will no longer exist.
The keynotes of this sign are exceedingly well known. They sound out the
note of individuality and of true self-consciousness. Many people are
convinced that they are self-conscious when they are only swayed by desire
and are oriented towards the satisfaction of that desire or when they
recognise themselves as the dramatic centre of their universe. Yet the only
truly self-conscious person is the man who is aware of purpose, of a selfdirected life and of a developed and definite life plan and programme.
Where [289] these are present, the inference is that there is mental
perception and some measure of integration. To be motivated only by
emotion and actuated by desire is no indication of true self-consciousness.
In the undeveloped man, it is far more instinctual than is self-awareness. In
the truly developed self-conscious man not only is direction, purpose and
plan present, but also a consciousness of the active agent of the plan and
action. Ponder on this.
There are two subsidiary yet potent keynotes of the Leo person upon which
I should touch at this point if the nature of the influences wielded by Leo are to be clearly perceived. These are the will-to-illumine, which constitutes the
driving urge towards self-knowledge, self-perception and intellectual
positivity, and also the will-to-rule and to dominate, which is of such a
controlling nature in this sign and such a subtle potency in the Leo type. It is
this will-to-rule which leads a person born in this sign eventually to achieve
self-mastery and the control of the personality (for either a good motive or a
selfish one), and it is also the same tendency which leads him finally to the
control by the personality, ruled by Leo, of groups and large or small bodies
of people. This—at an advanced stage—is an expression of the fusion of
Leo energy and Aquarian potency. It is inevitable in the long run for men
and races; for this all experience in Leo is preparatory. The will-to-illumine
is that which drives all Leo people on to experiment and so to gain
knowledge; it is this which links them with Taurus, which “carries the fair
jewel which gives light upon its forehead.” In the relationship of TaurusLeo-Aquarius, you have a significant and important zodiacal triangle as far
as man is concerned and it is peculiarly significant to the fourth Creative
Hierarchy, the human Hierarchy. You have, therefore: [290]
1. Taurus.—The incentive towards experience in order to gain
knowledge.
2. Leo.—The expression of experience in order to justify knowledge.
3. Aquarius.—The use of experience in order to make the gained
knowledge a factor in service.
This triangle expresses the life of humanity and it demonstrates finally the
perfection or consummation of the human way. Another triangle is of a
somewhat similar nature, Leo-Virgo-Pisces, but these three produce a still
more subtle expression of consciousness.
1. Leo.—The self-conscious man. Personality. Lower unity.
2. Virgo.—The latent Christ life or principle. Duality.
3. Pisces.—The group conscious soul. The world Saviour. Unity.
You will note how consistently the emphasis is laid upon consciousness and
its progressive unfoldment, and not upon the form or the aggregate of forms which veil the conscious entity of whatever nature or grade of being. Just as
A Treatise on Cosmic Fire endeavoured to give the psychological key to The
Secret Doctrine and to interpret the underlying consciousness which the
Beings (considered in The Secret Doctrine ) express, so in A Treatise on the
Seven Rays , I am carrying on the same idea and, at the same time, seeking
to give the needed key to modern exoteric psychology and also some
indications as to the astrological key to The Secret Doctrine to which H. Plutão .B.
refers. The Entities dealt with in her masterpiece of esoteric truth are here
revealed as cosmic, solar and planetary influences evoking—in response to
Their outpoured energy or vibratory [291] activity—an awakening of
consciousness in the form so that it becomes aligned to or closely related to
Their Own. All revelations appear to emerge into the consciousness of the
race in their lowest or most material form because the “ascent of knowledge
towards wisdom” is always the key to progress, and, therefore, exoteric
psychology and exoteric mundane astrology had to precede the revelation of
their significance; the nature of the form had to be made apparent and man
accustomed to it before the meaning behind the form could be revealed.
You may ask what is the reason for this mode of procedure? I can give you
one among many which, with a little intuitive reflection, should be
convincing to you. The understanding and the reasoning powers of the soul
are complete and developed. But souls—oriented towards incarnation and
the will-to-sacrifice—have not, as yet, the necessary forms in the three
worlds which are adequate for the expression of the knowledge which the
soul has on its own plane and level of awareness. If the inner meanings of
the outer symbolic forms of existence were registered by an unprepared
form (the response apparatus of the soul in the three worlds and, in the case
of man, involving an unprepared and undeveloped nervous system,
glandular system and brain) the destruction of the form by soul energy
would naturally supervene and a shattering of the lower expression would
take place. It is here that the significance and purpose of time can be noted
and intelligently employed, but this involves a most definite development of
the esoteric sense. There are other reasons, but this one will suffice. In the
evolutionary process there is, therefore, first the form, gradually prepared, adjusted, aligned and oriented during many aeons of time; behind this active
form, as it steadily improves and becomes more responsive to environment
and [292] contact, stands the slowly awakening consciousness. This is the
thinking, intuiting, loving soul, which tightens its hold over its response
apparatus, avails itself upon every possible occasion of every advance made
by the form, and employs every influence for the perfecting of the great
work which it undertook under the Law of Sacrifice.
It is for this reason that I have not attempted in this Treatise to prove—
scientifically and in the modern exoteric sense—the natural response to the
inner psychological factors and to the esoteric astrological influences. These
can be easily demonstrated and instantly made apparent once modern
science accepts the occult premises, even if only in an experimental and
hypothetical manner. I am confining myself entirely to the theme of the
unfoldment of consciousness, of meaning and of significances and of the
response of this conscious entity to the many influences and vibratory
impacts to which it is subjected on account of its being an integral part of
other and greater Lives. Ponder on this. This is my frequent injunction,
given because the activity of reflection is a potent means to revelation.
I have sought to bring the above thoughts to your attention because the sign
we are now studying is one in which the theme of self-consciousness lies
open to the investigator. Mass consciousness in Cancer gives place to
individual consciousness in Leo. Out of the mass or the herd emerges the
self-sufficient unit which becomes increasingly aware of its oneness, its
aloneness and its isolated attitude as the “one in the centre” of its small
cosmos. This attitude continues to develop and to become emphatic and
dynamic (I use these words with intent), leading to the pronounced egocentric consciousness of the selfish, intelligent man and to the ambitious
display of selfish power of the man who desires place and position. But
eventually the time comes [293] when the nature of the Fixed Cross begins
to dawn upon the consciousness of the man and the influence of Aquarius
(the polar opposite of Leo) begins to balance that of Leo. Then there comes
the gradual shift of the focus of attention away from the “one who stands alone” to the environing group, and an equally important shift away from
selfish interests to group requirements. This gives concisely the objective
which is attained by the man upon the Fixed Cross; the effect of that Cross
is to bring light and liberation. This can be clearly seen if we contrast the
energies of the four arms of the Cross as they are demonstrated by the man
both before and after the long and drastic experience upon the Cross.
1. Taurus.—The Bull of Desire. The light of aspiration and knowledge.
2. Leo.—The Lion of Self-assertion. The Light of the Soul.
3. Scorpio.—The Agent of Deception. The Light of Liberation. Júpiter . Aquarius.—The Chalice of Self-service. The Light of the world.
The Fixed Cross is the cross of light. And playing through this Cross all the
time, and emanating from Leo , are the “fires of God”—cosmic, solar and
planetary—producing purification, the intensification of the light and
eventual revelation to the purified man who stands in light. From Aries
comes cosmic fire; from Sagittarius comes planetary fire; and from Leo
comes solar fire; and each of these fires “clears the way by burning” for the
expression of the three divine aspects: spirit (Aries), soul (Leo) and body
(Sagittarius). Such is the scientific basis for the yoga of fire, applied by the
fully self-conscious man to the reflection of [294] the three divine aspects in
the three worlds; these are the three modes of divine expression in these
three worlds. Such is the significance of the fact that it will be found that
before the Door of Initiation lies the burning ground which all disciples and
initiates must tread. The Leo subject treads this burning ground with will
and self-effacement. When he has reached full self-consciousness and
mental integration and when he has attained personality effectiveness, then
he treads it—undeterred by pain.
A little thought will make it apparent to you why the Sun is the ruler of all
the three conditions of Leo—exoteric, esoteric and hierarchical. It is a
correct surmise that the purpose of this solar system is the unfoldment of
consciousness, and if for the strictly human being self-consciousness is the
goal, then the Sun must obviously rule, for it is the source of physical consciousness (exoteric and symbolic of the personality), of soul awareness
(esoteric), and of spiritual life (hierarchical). I am reiterating the necessity to
recognise the stimulation of consciousness as the objective of all the
astrological influences because the outstanding theme of Leo is the activity
of the self-conscious unit in relation to its environment or the development
of sensitive response to surrounding impacts by the one who stands—as the
Sun stands—at the centre of its little universe. The whole story and function
of Leo and its influences can be summed up in the word “sensitivity,” and
this sensitivity can be studied in four stages:
1. Sensitivity to conditioning impacts from the environment, i.e., to the
impacts of the world of human evolution, the three worlds or planes,
through the medium of the three aspects of the response apparatus of
the soul;
2. Sensitivity to the will, wishes and desires of the personality, [295] the
integrated self-conscious man, the lower self;
3. Sensitivity to the soul as the conditioning factor instead of sensitivity
to the environing world as the conditioning factor; Júpiter . The spiritual sensitivity of the God-Man (the soul and personality
fused) to the environment. At this stage of unfoldment, the liberated
man is not conditioned by his environment but begins the arduous
task of conditioning it in relation to the divine plan and purpose and at
the same time to cultivating sensitivity to the higher impacts of those
worlds which lead to the final goal.
I want you to have this innate spiritual sensitivity and this outer material
sensitivity most carefully in mind if you want truly to understand the
influences of Leo upon human beings and especially upon the person born
in this sign or who has this sign rising, as well as its influences upon the
planet. Throughout the universe, it is the soul which is the conscious,
sensitive theme of the divine plan—the soul as the anima mundi, or the soul
of the world, animating all forms of life below the animal kingdom; the soul
as the animal soul and the extension of this to the bodies of all animals,
including the human physical body; the soul as the human soul, which is a still further expansion of the same sensitive factor but augmented or
stimulated by the principle of self-awareness or of focussed personal
sensitivity to all sub-human soul expression, plus awareness (conscious or
unconscious) of the immortal or divine soul; the soul as the ego or spiritual
soul on its own plane—the source of consciousness as far as the three
worlds of evolution are concerned, and the goal of all present evolutionary
processes.
The three aspects of the Sun (as dealt with in The Secret [296] Doctrine )
are of importance at this point, because influences flowing through and from
them bring the entire subjective and latent world consciousness to the fore
and produce eventually (at the final revelation and liberation) the full
expression of the consciousness of Deity. This can be called divine
sensitivity, the universal mind or the divine plan or purpose. Words are
inadequate to express that of which the highest initiate as yet knows but
little. These three aspects of the Sun are the factors which bring
consciousness to the birth and make the ultimate goal attainable; they make
all forms of consciousness possible because these are rooted in the Sun
(symbolically speaking) and are an inherent aspect of the greater whole.
1. The physical Sun—the anima mundi; the animal soul. Multiplicity.
2. The heart of the Sun—the human soul and the divine ego. Duality.
3. The central, spiritual Sun—the divine consciousness. The will of the
whole. The awareness of God. Unity.
As you have been told, the Sun veils certain hidden planets, and in the case
of Leo, the two planets through which the Sun focusses its energy or
influences (like a lens) are Neptune and Uranus. The “heart of the Sun”
employs Neptune as its agent, whilst the central, spiritual Sun pours its
influences through Uranus. The activity of Uranus is, however, only
registered at a very advanced stage of development upon the Path and is
analogous to that point in the unfoldment of consciousness wherein, by an
act of the will, the conscious and illumined man (focussed in the highest
head centre) arouses the centre at the base of the spine and draws the
kundalini fire upwards. Making a broad and consequently [297] somewhat inaccurate generalisation, it might be said that this process is followed upon
the three Crosses:
1. Upon the Mutable Cross , it is the physical Sun and its influences which
affect the man, stimulate the bodily cells and sustain the form nature,
affecting the centres below the diaphragm.
2. Upon the Fixed Cross , it is the “heart of the Sun” which is called into
activity and which pours its energies through Neptune upon man. These
stimulate and affect the heart, the throat and the ajna centres.
3. Upon the Cardinal Cross , it is the central, spiritual Sun which is called
into play, and Uranus is then the distributing agency and the head centre
becomes the centre in the initiate's body through which direction and control
come.
In connection with the Mutable Cross, the rays of the Sun in a threefold
form (combining the lowest energies of the threefold Sun) pour into and
through the man, via Jupiter. Jupiter is the agent of the second ray which the
Sun expresses—cosmically and systemically.
Hence the triple relation of the Sun to Leo which is unique in our solar
system, and hence the importance of the triangle which controls the man
born under Leo—the Sun, Uranus and Neptune. The energy of Leo is
focussed through the Sun, and is distributed to our planet via the Sun and
the two planets which it veils.
Neptune, being the sign of the Deity of the waters, is related to the sixth ray
which governs the astral or emotional plane of desire. When Neptune is thus
active in the advanced Leo subject, then emotion-desire have been
transmuted into love-aspiration and are dedicated to and oriented [298] to
the soul; the entire emotional or sensitive nature is responsive to energies
coming from “the heart of the Sun,” and when this is the case, it indicates
that the disciple is now ready for the second initiation. This orientation is
brought about by what is called “the sublimination of the influence of the
Moon” which is, as you know, the mother, symbolically speaking, of the
form nature and reflects the Sun, or the Father aspect. The above statement is exceedingly occult in its significance. Esoterically speaking, you have the
emergence of an interesting triangle of force which affects the Leo subject
—the Sun, the Moon and Neptune; these are an expression of Rays 2. Júpiter .6
and, where these three are dominantly active, you have the establishing of
that “inner alignment and attitude which forces open the Door into the Holy
Place.” I use these old phrases here because they express concisely what it
would take many pages to elucidate and because they have that note of
esoteric stimulation which awakens, in the disciple, the power of abstract
thought.
In connection with the horoscope of the Leo subject and the theme of
initiation, I would point out that when the Sun, the Moon (hiding a planet)
and Saturn are all combined in a certain house in the horoscope you have
what is called the “sign” of the man who is to take initiation. Leo, being the
fifth sign of the zodiac, counting from Aries via Taurus, and also the eighth
sign, counting from Aries via Pisces, is closely connected through numerical
affinity with Mercury, who is esoterically called “the Messenger at the
eighth gate”; Mercury was active at the time of individualisation when the
“eighth gate” was opened and a major initiation of our planetary Logos took
place, producing, in the human kingdom, the process of individualisation.
From another angle, as might be anticipated, Leo is related [299] to
Scorpio, whose numbers upon the zodiacal wheel are the same as those of
Leo, being five and eight. You have, therefore, the formation of the triangle
to which I earlier referred: Leo-Scorpio, leading to initiation in Capricorn.
As we are upon the subject, one other point might be touched upon here.
August, which is ruled by Leo, is the month of the Dog-star, or of Sirius,
which thus brings Sirius into close relation to Leo. Leo, in the cosmic sense
(and apart from our solar system altogether) is ruled by Sirius. Sirius is the
home of that greater Lodge to which our fifth initiation admits a man and to
which it brings him, as a humble disciple. Later, when the new world
religion is founded and is working, we shall find that the major, monthly
festival in August, held at the time of the full moon, will be dedicated to the
task of making contact, via the Hierarchy, with Sirian force. Each of the months of the year will later be dedicated (through accurate astrological and
astronomical knowledge) to whichever constellation in the heavens governs
a particular month, as Sirius governs Leo. This I shall later elaborate in the
papers to be written anent the new “Approaches” to spiritual reality.
Mercury again comes, at this point, into our discussion, and you thus have
the formation of an esoteric quaternary, affecting powerfully the major
quaternary of man—spirit, soul, mind and brain. This energy brings about
an inter-relation and an inner awakening which prepares the aspirant for
initiation. This higher quaternary is Sirius-Leo-Mercury-Saturn. You have,
therefore:
Sirius Leo Mercury Saturn Spirit . . . . . . . . .
Life . . . . . . . . . .
Inhalation . . . . . . Soul . . . . . . . . . .
Quality . . . . . . . .
Interlude . . . . . . . Mind . . . . . . . . .
Illumination . . . .
Exhalation . . . . . Brain.
Appearance.
Interlude. [300] The above tabulation gives you the clue to the basic reality and
necessity of meditation as practised by the disciple and the initiate. This
may not be apparent to you at first sight and I may not further expand these
suggestions, but the directed reflection of the illumined mind may bring
insight to you in time. The influence of Sirius is not consciously felt until
after the third initiation when the true nature of the spirit aspect begins to
dawn upon the liberated, intuitive perception of the initiate. For the
advanced initiate in this sign, and after the third initiation, Sirius becomes a
major life factor. He begins to respond to its vibration because he now rules
the Sun and the Moon and is controlling those two planets, for that is what
the Sun and the Moon have become to him—simply planets to be ruled.
This is a great mystery and I simply state the fact. Sirius, Leo, the Sun, the
Moon and Mercury are now the influences with which the initiate is
concerned. The influences of Sirius, three in number, are focussed in
Regulus, which is, as you know, a star of the first magnitude and which is
frequently called “the heart of the Lion.” There is more real occultism
hidden in the names given to the various stars by astronomers down the ages
than has yet been realised, and here you have a case in point. It will be apparent to you (given a little thought) that the Sun, as it veils
Neptune, produces a potent effect upon the personality, symbolised for us
here by the astral body, whilst Uranus (which is also veiled by the Sun)
symbolises the effect of the soul upon the personality. Hence the activity of
the seventh ray, which is—from one angle—the lowest aspect of the first
ray. Hence you have also the underlying idea of: [301]
1. The awakening of the personality to soul control and contact, with a
true expression eventually, in the three worlds, of soul-will, desire and
intent.
2. The awakening of the seventh centre, the centre at the base of the
spine, by the soul working through the first or highest head centre and
producing (as a consequence) the surging upwards of the kundalini
fire. This, in its turn, produces fusion with the higher forces. When
this takes place the three major centres in the body are
The Head The Heart The base of Spine Central spiritual Sun . . . .
Sirius . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Sun . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The heart of the Sun . . . . . .
Mercury . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Uranus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The physical Sun.
Saturn.
Neptune. As the above alignment corresponds to a very high stage of initiation, it will
not be possible to grasp all the implications, but enough may be apparent to
reveal the underlying theme and purpose of the great work.
Several major triangles of force were active when individualisation took
place and the “Lions, the divine and tawny orange Flames” came into being
and thus humanity arrived upon the planet. I would touch here briefly upon
one triangle: The Sun (second ray), Jupiter (second ray) and Venus (fifth
ray). It will be apparent to you that we here have another sphere of influence
of major importance, governed by Leo. It is a triangle to which H. Plutão .B. refers
in The Secret Doctrine , the influence of which she was endeavouring to
elucidate. So potent was the influence of this triangle that its effect upon the
Moon was to denude her of life by drawing out all the “seeds of life,” thus
destroying her influence, for it was undesirable where humanity was
concerned. [302] Through Uranus, Leo is related to three other signs of the zodiac:
Aries, Libra and Aquarius, and these three constellations, with Leo, form
what has been called “the subjective quaternary of the reincarnating soul”
because they are related to the permanent atoms which persist from life to
life and which form—during the cycle of reincarnation—the repositories or
the storing houses of the experiences undergone during life in the three
worlds.
1. Aries —is connected with soul intention, the vibratory activity of
which (under impulse from the Monad) initiates the successive
involutionary periods which produce appearance upon the physical
plane.
2. Libra —is related to the mental unit and, as we saw when studying the
sign Libra, produces eventually a balance between the pairs of
opposites. This is brought about upon the astral plane. It is the
attainment of this balance which produces the reversal of the mode of
passing around the zodiacal wheel and it takes place when integration
has occurred, and the man is focussed upon the mental plane. He can,
then, through right use of the mind, discriminate between the pairs of
opposites and find the narrow razor-edged path which passes between
them and keep his balance upon it.
3. Leo —is connected with the astral permanent atom, for the reason that
desire or the power to go forth and occultly touch that which is
desired is the basis of all sense of awareness or responsiveness and
the underlying cause of progress or evolutionary movement forward;
it is the keynote of the man who has achieved that true “self-centred”
attitude which makes him an individual. Later, as responsiveness
grows and the world of small affairs is converted into the world of
ever larger [303] values and reality, the desires change into aspiration
and finally into spiritual will, purpose and intent. Júpiter . Aquarius —is eventually connected with the physical permanent atom
which is, as you know, upon the etheric level. It is this individual web
which is the medium of relationship to the whole. The universal consciousness of Aquarius becomes expressive just in so far as the
individual etheric body is in conscious relation with the etheric body
of humanity, the solar system and—of course—the planet.
I would here point out that the term “permanent atom” is essentially
symbolic and that what we call the permanent atom is in reality only a unit
of energy within the sphere of influence of the soul ray which can at any
time “pick it up” (if I may use so un-euphonious a phrase). In these atoms
the past memory of the personal self is stored; these are in the nature of
“memory cells” and are the repositories of past experience, of gained
quality, and of the particular note which the body of which it is the nucleus
has achieved. They are material in nature, are connected only with the form
aspect, and are imbued with as much of the quality of consciousness as the
soul has succeeded in developing in the three worlds. The whole subject is
most abstruse and will be only understood, and the symbolism involved
rightly interpreted, when clairvoyance is a normal attribute of average man.
Then the focus of the substance in any form (its galvanising centre) can be
seen. I do not here advise much reflection on the subject, as it is an
exceedingly difficult one, constituting, in itself, a very advanced science,
and embodying the mystery of the first solar system, the past—again the
memory cells give their contribution. It is through the permanent atoms that
the Forces of Materialism can [304] work; the Great White Lodge works
through the seven centres.
Aries begins the process and is the “initiator of the process which leads to
progress” and—at the end of the age (as it is now at the final or seventh
initiation)—the Initiator of the Mysteries will work under instructions and
with energies which emanate from the Lord of the Constellation Aries. In
the last analysis and esoterically speaking, fire is the great liberator and
Aries is the leading fire sign which will eventually “fuse the beginning and
the end, blend the opposites and dispel both time and space.” At present, the
Initiator of the Mysteries acts under inspiration and with energies emanating
from Capricorn—an earth sign—because humanity is, as yet, earth-bound.
The forces of initiation produce their major effects upon the physical plane, for it is there that the initiate has to demonstrate his liberation, his
understanding and his divinity.
Because of its position upon the Fixed Cross, Leo comes under the
influence, direct or indirect, of six planets: The Sun; Neptune; Uranus;
Jupiter; Venus; Mars. All of these are potent in expression in this sign,
achieving a determined point of revelation and producing, through their
united activity and interplay, the six-pointed star of humanity. They
condition the man's consciousness but not events, except in so far as his
consciousness assumes control at a certain point in his evolution. Connected
with the esoteric science of astrology are subsidiary sciences, such as the
Science of Triangles, to which I have frequently referred; there is also the
Science of Relationship, which concerns the relations between the many
quaternaries which can be discovered in the planetary interrelation, the
relation between four constellations, plus many human and divine
quaternaries. There is again the Science of Stars of Energy, [305] such as I
have here noted when referring to the six-pointed star of humanity, and of
this Science King Solomon's Seal is the well known symbol. These stars,
triangles and squares are found in all horoscopes—human, planetary,
systemic and cosmic—and constitute the life pattern of the particular Being
under investigation; they determine the time of manifestation and the nature
of the emanations and influences.
The squares or quaternaries relate to material appearance or form
expression; the stars concern the states of consciousness, and the triangles
are related to spirit and to synthesis. In the archives of the esoteric
astrologers connected with the Hierarchy, charts are kept of those members
of the human family who have achieved adeptship and upwards. They are
composed of superimposed squares, stars and triangles, contained within the
zodiacal wheel and mounted upon the symbol of the Cardinal Cross. The
squares, having each of their four angles and points in one or other of four
zodiacal constellations, are depicted in black; the five-pointed star is
depicted yellow or golden colour and its five points are in contact with five
of the constellations on the great wheel; the triangles are in blue and have, above each point of the triangle, an esoteric symbol, standing for the
constellations of the Great Bear, Sirius and the Pleiades. These symbols may
not here be revealed but indicate the point of spiritual consciousness
achieved and the responsiveness of the initiate to these major cosmic
influences. A glance at these geometrical charts will indicate in a moment
the status of the initiate, and also the point towards which he is striving.
These charts are fourth dimensional in nature and not flat surfaces as are our
charts. This is an interesting piece of information but of no value, except in
so far that it indicates synthesis, the fusion of spirit, soul and body, and the
point of development. It [306] proves also the fact that “God geometrises”
where the soul is concerned. These charts are most interesting.
The relation of Leo to Cancer, through Neptune, has already been touched
upon above and is, of course, easily apparent to you if you have the slightest
understanding of the consciousness aspect of evolution. There is, first of all,
the mass consciousness; then the consciousness of the dramatic, isolated
self, and finally again group consciousness, which is, in reality, the highest
forms of group consciousness and individual consciousness combined
together in the service of the Plan. Reflect on this definition, for it will
stimulate you to understanding.
The peculiar significance of Leo in the general evolution of consciousness,
particularly in the human family, is determined by the control of those two
mysterious planets, Uranus and Neptune; in the man who is ready for
initiation you have, therefore, a dual control, i.e., the Sun itself and also the
Sun as it veils the influences of these two planets, or rather, as it focusses
and transmits them with intensity. This produces the following
developments:
1. The Sun—Full self-consciousness. This—through the influence of the
physical Sun and the “heart of the Sun”—produces awareness of the
relation of the higher self and the lower self. Man becomes aware of
his essential duality.
2. Uranus—Occult consciousness or that intelligent, fusing condition
which produces the scientific at-one-ment of the two factors, higher and lower self, through the intelligent use of the mind.
3. Neptune—Mystical consciousness or that innate sensitivity which
leads unerringly to the higher vision, to the recognition of the interrelation involved in man's [307] essential duality during the process
of manifestation, plus the activity of the mediator.
You have, therefore, the conscious, integrated Self, functioning with full
occult knowledge and also with mystical perception when the influences of
Leo, focussed through the Sun, Uranus and Neptune, have been carried
adequately forward in the life of the advanced disciple. This is one of the
reasons why Leo is a sign of such paramount importance and why the
intelligent Leo subject can usually attain his goal, once he accurately
perceives that objective.
This sign has frequently been described as the “battlefield of the Forces of
Materialism and the Forces of Light.” It is occultly regarded as one of the
most material signs, in-as-much as selfish desire for possession of material
objectives can be peculiarly present and the display of the possessive spirit
can violently control; yet, at the same time, the advanced Leo person can
function as the “inspired spiritual Sacrifice.” He is then sensitive to world
conditions and freed from personal desires.
Before individual man can achieve initiation, he must be fully selfconscious, mystically oriented and occultly developed. He must be aware of
himself as he essentially is—a soul involved in form which is itself
developed and unfolded through soul activity; he must be a developed
mystic, capable of pure vision, motivated by spiritual intent and able to
perceive the uses of inherent sensitivity; he must also be a trained occultist,
mentally polarised and profoundly aware of the realities, forces and energies
of existence and, therefore, free from the ordinary glamours and illusions
which colour the reactions and life of the average man. He is then governed
by the physical Sun, motivated by the energies pouring from “the heart of
the Sun” (via [308] Neptune) and bringing about at-one-ment through the
forces which are reaching him (via Uranus). Beyond these two distant planets, lies another planet as yet undiscovered,
though speculation is rife about it, owing to certain unexplained movements
of the planet Neptune. It is through this planet that the Forces (as they are
related to Leo and Aquarius) are focussed in one potent stream of force;
these pour into our planetary life during the month of August, and distribute
themselves, via Uranus and Neptune. You have, therefore, in this
connection:
LEO AND AQUARIUS
The physical Sun Heart of the Sun
/
The undiscovered planet.
/
Uranus and Neptune.
/
The human Hierarchy.
/
The animal Kingdom. Central spiritual Sun. Charts of the cosmic lines of directed forces such as the above can be given
for all the energies of the constellations and planetary forces, but this is the
only one I choose, at this time, to indicate, because it is of major importance
to humanity; the others might prove misleading, given man's present point
of intelligent understanding and influence.
I would here call to your attention that, through these directing planets, the
following rays are controlling factors in the chart of the Leo subject:
1. The Sun—2nd ray—love-wisdom.
2. Uranus—7th ray—organisation or directed manifestation.
3. Neptune—6th ray—idealistic one-pointedness. Devotion to an
objective.
[309] In the perfected Leo, the loving self-conscious soul (2nd ray) carries
its power of expression straight through from its own plane to the plane of
exterior manifestation, but preserves at the same time its interior control
(Uranus) and from that point of achievement, proceeds to make its ideal objective (Neptune) a fact in consciousness, through sensitivity to the higher
vibration and directed intelligent service of the Plan. Ponder on this
summation.
When Uranus controls, the Leo person is significantly the true observer,
detached from the material side of life, but utilising it as he pleases. His
spiritual consciousness is capable of great expression and he can be (as has
oft been pointed out by astrologers) both an electric, dynamic leader, a
pioneer in new fields of endeavour and also a magnetic centre of a group
whether the group is small, as in a home, or vast as in a nation. He is then
polarised above the diaphragm, for the lower more material aspects of life
have really no great appeal to him; he is then profoundly conscious of his
own identity, and this makes him dwell definitely in a state of selfawareness, with its consequently abstracting powers. He is instantly aware,
once he is spiritually awakened, of his motivating impulses, and this leads
him to an imposed self-discipline—the thing the Leo subject sorely needs
and which must always be self-imposed and self-applied for he brooks no
disciplinary measures which others may seek to impose. Discipline imposed
by people upon the Leo person leads invariably to revolt and rebellion and
the expression of that which the discipline is intended to eradicate.
Discipline imposed by himself leads to the perfection of which he is notably
capable. It is this innate ability to control which frequently gives the Leo
subject an apparently negative attitude to life; he inevitably believes that his
destiny is determined and that all that he has to do [310] is simply to be ; he
refuses often then to change or to take action, and when this is carried too
far it leads to an unexpectedly futile life. The “lion must emerge from its
lair,” and this injunction is badly needed by Leo aspirants. It will, when
followed, lead the self-centred Leo consciousness into the decentralised,
selfless Aquarian awareness. It will alter the self-service of Leo into the
group service of its polar opposite, Aquarius. It might appropriately be
added here that the prayer or voiced aspiration of the true Leo person can be
expressed in the words of Christ, so well known to all of us: “Father, not my
will but thine be done.” I would also call your attention to another interesting fact in connection with
this sign. No planet falls in Leo and no planet is exalted in this sign, whilst
the power of both Uranus and Saturn is somewhat lessened, except in the
case of the initiate who responds powerfully to the esoteric influence of
Uranus. The same basic teaching is here conveyed as was taught by the Sun
ruling exoterically, esoterically and hierarchically. Leo in its consciousness
is the dominant self-aware agent and has therefore the control and can—
because of this—remain uninfluenced. This fact will be increasingly
understood as the advanced Leo subject makes his appearance. He will be
distinguished by his personal freedom from outside control. He knows
innately that he is king of himself, the ruler of his own life and, therefore, no
planet is exalted and likewise no planet falls. The power of the mind, as
symbolised by Uranus, is lessened, for it is not the mind which in reality
controls but the Self, or Soul, using and controlling the mind. The man is
not then conditioned by his surroundings or life events but rules them with
deliberation, bringing out of circumstances and environment that which he
requires. Saturn, therefore, the Lord of Karma, has his power lessened in
[311] this sign. It is for this reason that Sepharial is incorrect when he gives
Saturn as the ruler of the first decanate. The three decanates are given by
him as being ruled by Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Alan Leo is, however,
nearer the truth when he gives us the Sun, Jupiter and Mars.
Self-rule through initial conflict, carried to a successful issue and blessed by
the beneficence of Jupiter, is the true history of the advanced Leo aspirant,
and this thought and the objective result of this realisation is summed up for
us in the two word mottoes of this sign:
1. And the Word said: Let other forms exist. I rule because I am.
2. I am That and That am I.
I Am—the Word of the self-conscious, selfish, individual Leo.
I Am That—the Word of the Leo subject who is rapidly gaining the higher
consciousness and preparing for fresh and universal expression in Aquarius. CANCER, THE CRAB
This sign is not an easy one for the average student to understand for it is
the polar opposite—psychologically speaking—of the state of group
consciousness towards which humanity is, at this time, tending. It is difficult
for the casual student to distinguish accurately between mass consciousness
and group consciousness. Human beings stand today at a midway point,
generally speaking, between these two states of mind, though perhaps it
might be more correct to say that a fairly large minority are becoming group
conscious, whilst the majority are emerging out of the mass conscious stage
and becoming self-conscious individuals. [312] This accounts for much of
the present world difficulty and for the clash of idealisms. The two groups
bring a different approach to the world problems as we now find them. We
have, therefore, three signs which (from the angle of consciousness) are
closely connected yet are widely separate and different in effect.
1. Cancer—mass consciousness—instinctual awareness.
2. Leo—self consciousness—intelligent awareness.
3. Aquarius—group consciousness—intuitional awareness.
With much of this we have already dealt and there is no need for repetition
as we study the polar opposites of the signs already considered. I do not
intend to refer unduly and in detail to points with which you are already
familiar, save to bring to your attention the beautiful and synthetic unfolding
of the divine Plan.
This sign is, as you already know, one of the two gates of the zodiac because
through it souls pass into outer manifestation and to the appropriation of
form, and subsequent identification with it for many long cycles. It is “the
gate which stands wide open, broad and easy to pass through and yet it leads
unto the place of death and to that long imprisonment which precedes the
final revolt.” It is allied with material nature, and with the mother of forms,
just as the other gate, Capricorn, is allied with spirit, the father of all that IS. In this sign lies hid the whole problem of the Law of Rebirth. Reincarnation
is implicit in the manifested universe and is a basic and fundamental theme
underlying systemic pulsation. There are certain things which I would like
to make clear in connection with reincarnation.
This sign, Cancer, being concerned primarily with the world of causes, has
about its inner meaning much indefiniteness [313] and an apparently vague
subtlety which proves most elusive to the ordinary thinker. This also is true
of all the signs which go to the forming of the Cardinal Cross of the
Heavens. In the last analysis, it is only the initiated disciple who can fathom
the true meaning of these zodiacal influences as they pulsate throughout the
manifested universe, because they are primarily the expression of spirit or
life more than of soul or body. Therefore, until after the third initiation—as
you have oft been told—there is little to be known or said about that
“mysterious essence which is divinity in motion.” When you, for instance,
read that the keynotes of this sign can be expressed in the Biblical phrase
“the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters” does it, in reality,
mean anything specific to you? You might reply by saying that it means,
God moved in substance and produced by moving the outer tangible forms.
But does that truly convey to you an intelligible truth? In Cancer, God
breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul.
In these words, you have established the relation which exists in the mind of
God between spirit (the breath of life) the soul (consciousness) and man (the
form). However, does that statement convey an intelligible concept to your
mind? I think not, because the synthesis of the final relation is beyond the
average grasp and its `linking' or essential unity (lying as it does outside of
consciousness and known reality) takes place first of all in this sign—one of
the most ancient of the signs and one of the first to be recognised and
established as an influencing factor by ancient humanity.
I state a basic truth—vaguely acknowledged by you—that in Aries the
essential substance of manifestation awoke to renewed activity under the
impact of divine desire, impelled by the divine Breath, by divine Life or
Spirit. In [314] Cancer this living substance assumed a triple differentiated relationship to which we give the names of Life (Aries) of Consciousness
(Taurus, the next sign to Aries) and manifested duality (Gemini, the sign
preceding Cancer) and these three, blended together, came into outer
manifestation in Cancer, thus completing an esoteric quaternary of great
importance. Here the first major fusion, inchoate and unrealised, took place.
In Libra , these reach a point of balance and of a somewhat static
equilibrium (later to be disturbed in Scorpio), so that this essential triplicity
appears clearly in relation to each other. In Capricorn , the sign of initiation,
this basic triplicity begins to return to the earlier state of the “breath of
spirit” but, this time, with full awareness and properly fulfilled organisation,
so that form is a perfect expression of the soul and the soul is sensitive and
responsive to the pulsations of the One Life, as that Life reveals, through its
activity, the perfect will of the Logos.
The secret (so-called) of the Cardinal Cross is the secret of Life itself, just as
that of the Fixed Cross is that of the soul or the mystery of self-conscious
entity, whilst the Mutable Cross holds hid the mystery of form. In these
words, you have the key to the secret of manifestation as a whole and to that
mystery which was revealed to Christ at the final crucifixion and to which
He testified His understanding reaction in the triumphant utterance recorded
in The New Testament : “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me.”
He then left the Fixed Cross and the Identity which has hitherto been His
and identified Himself with that which was then revealed. To these words,
thus translated somewhat inaccurately in the Christian Bible, there are three
meanings or true significances. The translation hinted at in The Secret
Doctrine (S.D. Gêmeos . 613), [315] “The robe, the robe, the beautiful robe of my
strength no longer serves” expresses the inner revelation of the Mutable
Cross, as it was revealed to the Saviour, looking at life from the angle of the
soul. In the words quoted above “My God, My God, why hast Thou
forsaken Me,” the mystery of the Fixed Cross was shown to Him and the
secret of the Cardinal Cross was, for the first time, held before His eyes. The
words, embodying that central mystery, have never yet been given out. One
of the factors which distinguished the Christ from all preceding world
Saviours was the fact that He was the first of our humanity Who, having achieved divinity (and this many have done), was permitted to see the
“golden thread of light and of living life which links the light within the
centre of all the manifested Crosses”; He was allowed to know the meaning
of life as it expressed itself in the Cosmic Crucifixion, which is an episode
of cosmic life and not of death, as is generally supposed.
Hercules comprehended the true meaning of the Mutable Cross and, with
full knowledge, mounted the Fixed Cross, with all its attendant difficulties
and labours. The Buddha comprehended, through complete illumination, the
meaning of both the Mutable and the Fixed Crosses, for the secret of
revelation in Taurus was His, just as the secret of directed energy in Scorpio
was the source of the strength of Hercules. But the Christ, knowing both the
above secrets, also understood with a living comprehension, the mystery of
the Cardinal Cross, because the light of the Transfiguration (undergone in
Capricorn) revealed to Him the glory and transcendent mystery.
There are two words also which convey the purpose and intent of expression
upon the Cardinal Cross. They give the reason why the two “Doors of the
Zodiac” open [316] wide to the impulse and demand of the divine Spirit.
One is the word “self-preservation” which leads to the impulse to incarnate
in Cancer, which is the Door to the physical plane expression of spirit. This
impulse (when the form is the prime object of the attention of the soul and
that with which it primarily identifies itself) brings about the stage of static
concretion in the earth sign Capricorn. The other word is “immortality”
which is the divine aspect of self-preservation; it is the major conditioning
factor in the creative process and leads to the whole revelation of evolution,
to the recurrent appearance of life in form, and to the revelation of life in
form. In Capricorn, at the third initiation, this life aspect assumes primary
importance.
You will see, therefore, why the Cardinal Cross is so mysterious; also why
both Cancer and Capricorn are so little understood by modern astrology and
why, in the last analysis, only the initiated Sons of God can grasp the
significance of the four signs which comprise the Cardinal Cross, or
understand the relation which exists between the four major divine energies which—pouring through the four arms of this Cross—produce the vortex of
force (a synthetic force) which constitutes that “pool of pure, fiery light”
through which all those who take the higher initiations must eventually pass.
Those taking the first two initiations must tread the Path as it passes through
the Burning Ground. Those taking the higher initiations have to plunge into
the sea or pool of fire which is essentially the fire of God as it has been
cleansed from every aspect of the material form through the complete
purification of desire.
The entire subject of rebirth is but little understood at present. Its modern
presentation and the emphasis which has been laid so strongly on small and
unimportant details have distorted and diverted the wide sweep of the
subject [317] and ignored the true import of the process; the broad general
lines of the incarnation process have been largely overlooked. In the debate
as to the length of time a man is out of incarnation and in the consideration
of foolish items of unproved and unprovable information, and in the puerile
reconstruction of the past lives of theosophically inclined people (none of
them based on any truth), the real truth and the real beauty of the theme
have been lost to sight.
Cancer is one point of the watery triplicity, and the symbolism which
underlies the three water signs is most interesting in one particular direction.
You have, as you know, the Crab, the Scorpion and the Fish Goddesses of
the sign Pisces. In ancient Lemuria, the symbol of Pisces was a woman with
the tail of a fish, and of this symbol the legendary mermaid is the memory. It
was only in late Atlantean times (when the conscious sense of duality was
becoming present in the minds of the advanced humanity of the period) that
the woman part of the symbol was dropped altogether and the two linked
fishes took the place of the fish Goddesses. You have, therefore, the Crab,
the Scorpion with the sting in its tail and the Fish. The slow moving Crab,
identified with its dwelling place and carrying its house upon its back, lives
upon the land (physical plane life) and also in the sea (the life of the
emotions); the Scorpion is rapid in movement, deadly in its effect upon men
around it and is a creature of the land; it is also the symbol of the transformed Crab and the result of the evolutionary process, and indicates
the dangerous nature of the man who is not transformed and is therefore
harmful and hurtful to others; the Fishes indicate the man from whom the
symbol of materiality has been taken by the removal of half of the original
symbol, thus indicating freedom from matter. The three water signs give us,
therefore, a brief and symbolic [318] history of man's growth and true
personality development. It is a picture of the law of cause and effect. These
thoughts you can elaborate for yourself and thus arrive at the evident
implications.
There is also a significant relationship between five signs which are deeply
esoteric in their nature and their effects when swept into this particular
interplay. They are only called into activity during the return half of the
wheel of life or the “wheel of living action or of conscious undertaking” as
it is called in the Old Commentary . This name is given to the wheel as it
turns anti-clockwise from Aries to Pisces via Taurus. This fivefold
relationship is only established upon the Path of Discipleship and is brought
about by the esoteric linking of Cancer-Virgo-Scorpio-Capricorn-Pisces. In
the future horoscopes of disciples, this significant interplay of forces will be
recognised as dominating the chart at a particular and peculiar stage of
discipleship. In this case, disciples will be born in one or other of these signs
or with one of other of these signs rising.
You have two signs of water and earth (Cancer and Virgo) in the stage of
sub-conscious emphasis wherein everything is latent and hidden. Human
consciousness is only embryonic in Cancer, for it is the mass mind which
dominates and not the individual mind. In Virgo, the Christ life or
consciousness is hidden and the Christ Child is as yet embryonic in the
womb of matter and of time, and during this stage, the emphasis is upon the
form which veils and hides the reality. The human soul and the divine soul
(the essential duality) are there but their presence is not easily detected. In
Scorpio comes a point of transition, of change and of re-orientation. That
which has been hitherto hidden appears and is brought to the surface by
means of the experience, the tests, the trials and the “sting of life.” In Capricorn—[319] as a result of the effects of the influences of Cancer,
Virgo and Scorpio—the disciple begins to demonstrate the capacity to
express the life of two kingdoms, at least in some measure, and is a
developed human being and also a citizen of the kingdom of God.
Therefore, for an initiate and for a period of three incarnations, the four
signs of revelation (Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio and Capricorn) intensify their
effect upon him, until in the fourth incarnation he begins to respond to the
inner influence of Pisces. He thus demonstrates his ability to react to the
Shamballa influence and, when this influence is established, he goes out to
salvage and to save. He acts consciously as a world mediator. Therefore, it
might be stated that:
1. In Cancer , the influence of the human Hierarchy begins to make its
presence felt and to include the dualism of man. This emerges clearly in
Virgo. Soul and body are closely related and knit together in one form. Man
is a conscious personality, and this is a result of the Cancer experience,
consummated in Virgo.
Such is the way of humanity. The human centre is active.
2. In Scorpio , the influence of the occult Hierarchy begins to set its seal on
the human being, and his essential duality is put to the test. This is
preparatory to a new and higher unity. He is at the miserable stage of being
neither the soul nor the form—the stage of transition.
Such is the way of the disciple. The hierarchical centre is affecting him
powerfully.
3. In Pisces , the influence of Shamballa claims the initiate as its field of
activity and the dualism of soul and spirit emerges instead of that of soul
and body which has hitherto been of major importance. The power of the
[320] form to hold the soul in captivity has been negated and tests and trials
of the initiate up to the third initiation are directed to this end.
Such is the way of the initiate.
You will note the interesting fact that you have here nine signs which carry a
man from the stage of imprisonment in form to the freedom of the kingdom of God, from the state of embryonic consciousness to the full flower of
divine knowledge, from the condition of human awareness to the conscious
wisdom of the initiated disciple. These nine signs are strictly expressive of
human unfoldment—conscious and superconscious, though beginning with
the mass awareness of Cancer. There are three signs, preceding these, which
provide the subtle or subjective realities of the will-to-be (Aries), the desireto-know (Taurus) and the establishment of relationship (Gemini), and these
constitute the triple incentive to the manifestation of man and of the human
kingdom. They correspond cosmically to the logoic, the monadic and
spiritual planes to which the higher initiate has access or when dealing with
the entire concept on a lower turn of the spiral and in connection with
ordinary man, they correspond to the mental, the astral and the etheric
vehicles of man. They are, therefore, related to the highest and the lowest
expression of human life. I have in the above ideas given you several hints
of vital importance. One of the symbols of an initiate of a certain degree is
that of the five-pointed star with a triangle in the centre; this is a reference to
the energy of the watery triangle with which we have just been concerned
and to the fivefold linking which has been established in the consciousness
of the initiate.
We come now to a consideration of the rulers of this sign and to a study of
the planets which act as focal points [321] and as distributing agents for
certain cosmic energies. Much has been earlier indicated along this line, and
a true understanding of the nature of these impacting energies can only be
grasped as we continue with our studies and investigate these signs in the
relation which they assume as we study them in connection with other signs,
claiming the same planetary rulers. There is one point which I would like to
make clear and that is that in the two rulers of this sign—the Moon and
Neptune—you have the symbols of a close relationship between the Mother
of all Forms and the God of the Waters, that is between the two planets. In
this esoteric marriage, you have pictured for humanity a major synthesis of
form and of desire-sensitivity and, consequently, a true statement of the
stage of consciousness which we call Atlantean. There is much of this today
and of this stage, mass sensitivity and mass identification with form and with forms is the significant indication and the outstanding characteristic of
Cancer and its subjects. The Moon, however, relates Cancer to two other
signs and these form a cosmic triangle. They are Cancer-Virgo-Aquarius. In
this combination, you have the sign of mass-consciousness, the sign of the
Christ-consciousness and the sign of universal consciousness very closely
related to each other and all of them through the medium of the influence of
Neptune, which the Moon veils.
Like Leo, which is ruled in all its three expressions (orthodox, esoteric and
hierarchical) by the Sun, Cancer is the only other sign which is ruled by
only one planet, though in orthodox astrology, the Moon is substituted for
Neptune because it is the form nature which is dominant in the longest stage
of human unfoldment, just as esoterically, it is the feeling-sensitive nature
which dominates the average man; it is with this stable tendency that the
disciple has to [322] wrestle. In the mass mind (of which Cancer is the
truest expression), it is fortunate that Neptune is veiled by the Moon and
that the form fails to register or step down many of the impacts to which the
true man is sensitive. Average humanity is not yet fully equipped to bear the
full range of these impacts, to handle them constructively or to transmute
them and interpret them accurately. Upon the Path of Discipleship and along
the line of esoteric development, one of the major difficulties and great
problems of the disciple is his extreme sensitivity to impacts from every
side and his rapid ability to respond to contacts coming from “all points of
the compass, from every angle of the zodiacal wheel and from that which is
within as well as from that which is without, from that which lies above,
below, and upon every hand,” as the Old Commentary expresses it. It is also
as difficult and hard for the average student of modern times to grasp the
mass-consciousness of Cancer as it is for him to grasp the group-awareness
or the universal consciousness of Aquarius and to this final development,
humanity is hierarchically related by the Moon, veiling Neptune. The
average human being is just beginning to grasp the stage of the individual
Christ consciousness of Virgo to which he is related by the same planet. The unveiled Neptune relates Cancer to no other constellation or sign, and
this fact is of very great importance, because it indicates the fact that when a
man is an initiate, he does not react to ordinary feeling, sentiment or to
personality relations as they express themselves in pleasure or pain. All
these are surmounted and eventually the watery life of emotional reaction is
superseded by the life of true and of inclusive love. Soul control esoterically
“obliterates” the Moon and all traces of Neptunian life. The initiate is no
longer ruled by the Mother of Forms or by the God of [323] the Waters.
When the “waters break and are carried away,” the Mother gives birth to the
Son and that individual spiritual entity then stands free. I would ask you to
ponder upon this point.
These two—the Moon and Neptune—are, therefore, the direct influences
which are brought to bear upon the Cancer subject and thus lead to the
unfoldment of the form of life and of the emotional-astral body. The
supreme usefulness of these aspects will be grasped if you will intelligently
realise that without the form and without the ability to bear in mind the need
to respond sensitively to the environing conditions and circumstance, the
soul would never awaken to knowledge in the three worlds and, therefore,
would never know God in manifestation.
Indirectly, and via the influences of the Cardinal Cross (of which Cancer is a
part), the Cancerian subject is affected by or influenced by five other
planets, which are Mars, Mercury, Uranus, Venus and Saturn. The Cancerian
subject becomes responsive to the uses of conflict (Mars), to the functioning
of the light of intuition (Mercury) and to the cosmic pull of Uranus, plus the
intellect of Venus and the presentation of opportunity (Saturn). These,
however, play subjectively upon the dweller in the form and are not
consciously registered as potencies by the individual for many aeons of time
and not until the life of the form and the reaction to sensitive emotionfeeling has played an active and an educational part in the awakening of the
mind. Once that awakening of desire and its transmutation into the higher
aspiration has taken place, then the Virgo influence comes in and the
responsive soul—developed by the five indirect influences of the Cardinal Cross—begins its active conscious participation in the drama of life. Thus
the direct and the indirect influences of the seven planets play their [324]
varied parts in man's unfoldment, and students would find it of interest and
of value to relate the effects of these seven planetary forces to the unfolding
seven principles of man.
Let us now briefly consider for a few minutes the effect of the ray
influences as they focus through the seven planets upon the man born in the
sign Cancer.
It is here that there will be found certain basic indications as to the nature
and the processes of the Law of Rebirth. It would appear that as yet only
two rules are posited in connection with the return of an ego to physical
incarnation. The first is that if perfection has not been achieved then the soul
must return and continue the perfecting process upon the Earth. The second
is that the impulse predisposing the ego to such action is some form of
unsatisfied desire. Both these statements are true in part and generic in
effect but they are only partial truths and incident to larger truths which
have not yet been sensed or noted accurately by esotericists; they are
secondary in nature and are expressed in terms of the three worlds of human
evolution, of personality intent, and of time-space concepts. Basically, it is
not desire which prompts return but will and knowledge of the plan. It is not
the need for achieving an ultimate perfection which goads the ego on to
experience in form, for the ego is already perfect. The main incentive is
sacrifice and service to those lesser lives that are dependent upon the higher
inspiration (which the spiritual soul can give) and the determination that
they too may attain planetary status equivalent to that of the sacrificing soul.
It is in order eventually to negate the space-time concept and to prove it an
illusion that the door in Cancer opens to the sacrificing, serving soul. Bear
this always in mind as you study the subject of rebirth. In themselves,
rebirth and reincarnation are misleading [325] terms and “cyclic
impulsion,” “intelligent purposeful repetition” and “conscious in-breathing
and out-breathing” would describe more accurately this cosmic process. It
is, however, difficult for you to grasp this idea, for it necessitates the ability to identify oneself with the One Who thus breathes—the planetary Logos—
and the entire theme must therefore remain relatively obscure until initiation
has been taken. Esoterically speaking, the point of greatest interest lies in
the fact that it is group rebirth which is taking place all the time and that the
incarnation of the individual is only incidental to this greater happening.
This has been largely ignored or forgotten because of the intense and selfish
interest in personal experience and living, evidenced in the speculative
details anent individual return given in the current so-called occult books,
most of which are largely inaccurate and certainly unimportant.
An intelligent understanding of the Plan is needed before the real truth anent
reincarnation can emerge with clarity in the public consciousness. Groups of
souls come into incarnation cyclically and together in order to further the
Plan and permit that interplay to proceed between spirit and matter which
makes manifestation possible and which extends the working out of the
divine ideas as they exist in the Mind of God. When the Plan (as the
Hierarchy understands it) is more familiar in its objectives and its mode of
functioning upon the outer plane of life, we shall see a complete change in
the presentation of the teaching concerning the Law of Rebirth. We shall see
more clearly the existent synthesis of:
1. The divine plan as it manifests in time.
2. The basic relations as they manifest in space.
3. The developing effects as they demonstrate in groups. [326] Júpiter . The evolving understanding as intellect merges into the intuition.
5. The fivefold nature of the logoic expression as it unfolds itself through
the five kingdoms.
and this, when correctly intuited, will produce a revelation, and a
presentation of this abstruse theme beyond anything at this time sensed by
man. It is one of the secrets of the first initiation and these secrets are today
in process of externalisation.
It will be found that rebirth is, in truth, a magical and magnetic interplay
between the form side of life and life itself. This interplay is consciously undertaken by the soul which is the product of the two related factors. The
above statement is, in itself, complex and difficult and far from easy to
grasp; it however expresses a significant fact which the Old Commentary
phrases as follows:
“Those who are demanding to be saved have cried aloud. Their voices
penetrate into the formless world and there evoke response.
“Those who in distant aeons have pledged themselves to save and
serve respond. Their cry too rings forth and, ringing, penetrates into the
dark and distant places within the worlds of form.
“And thus a vortex is established and kept alive by that constant dual
sound. And then a touch is made and for a space and during time, the two
are one—the Saving Souls and the Units to be served.
“Slowly the vision of the Saving One becomes a light which guides the
Crying Ones into the place of light.”
I would suggest to investigators that the entire theme of “cyclic impulse” be
approached from the angle of the group , forgetting, as this is done, the
glamour of the personality [327] impress. The sweep of known history will
aid in this, indicating—as it does—the possibility of clarification and the
usefulness of classifying and isolating group activity and character down the
ages. When the major reincarnating groups are thus distinguished and their
work for the fourth kingdom along many lines is more clearly seen then the
whole subject will be better understood, evoking the play of the intuition.
This demonstrates a second fact of importance, namely that, as yet, it will
only be possible to trace the progress of advanced souls in incarnation and
not trace, at this time, the cyclic appearing of the unevolved. They are the
“material units” which have to be saved by the more advanced. The theme
of service and sacrifice runs, unrecognised, through history. The key to the
understanding of these reincarnating, saving factors lies in a coming
intuitive ability to recognise the reincarnating groups, as groups and not
individuals, through their ray qualities, and it was for this purpose that I
gave in Destiny of the Nations a statement as to the rays governing certain nations. Groups are governed by the astrological signs and by the rays just
as individuals are, and these rays affect them, via the ruling planets. I have
here opened up to you a very wide field of research and I have indicated a
most interesting new form of historical investigation and record. The history
of the future will be the history of the evolving plans of God as they work
out through the serving groups of egos who will come into physical
incarnation under the influence of “divine duality” to carry forward the
development of the lives which constitute the form through which divinity
is seeking full expression. The relation of the fourth ray to the fourth
kingdom in nature (which is the fourth Creative Hierarchy) is a
predetermining influence in all world conflict up to date and is the cause
which has produced the history [328] of war and conflict down the ages.
The theme of that ray is “Harmony through Conflict” and it is the lower
aspect of the ray energy, producing conflict which has hitherto controlled,
and is climaxing now through the impetus of the new incoming Shamballa
force. As it exhausts itself (and this is rapidly coming about) there will be a
shift of direction and force to that major ray, the second Ray of LoveWisdom, of which the fourth ray is an aspect. This second ray energy is very
potently focussed through the constellation Gemini via the planet, Jupiter.
We shall then have the inauguration of a long cycle of beneficent
development in which the conflict essential to the interplay between the
dualities will be stabilised upon the mental plane and—under the influence
of the salvaging, serving egos of the fifth kingdom—entirely change world
civilisation.
It is valuable also to remember that in the studying of the ray forces and
their effects in Cancer, we must do so from the angle of the mass mind and
the mass reaction and not from that of the individual. This is one of the
signs of synthesis and of a relative fusion, but it is a fusion on the lower
level of the spiral and connotes the fusion of the physical body and the soul
but only in the embryonic stage and with the psychic stage still
unindividualised. It is the stage of mass reaction to the incoming of the Sons
of Light. The entire theme of the zodiac can be approached from the angle of light
and its unfolding and increasing radiance and of the gradual demonstration
in what I have called elsewhere, “the glory of the One.” The mode of the
development of this inner light and of its externalisation must remain—from
the standpoint of its cosmic effects—one of the secrets of initiation and this
for a long time to come. It will, however, not be out of place if I were to
give symbolically certain phrases and sentences which will indicate [329]
(for each sign) this “growth of light in light,” as it is esoterically called,
bearing in mind that we are attempting to express conditions connected with
the soul whose essential nature is light. This soul-light affects the form as
evolution proceeds and produces sequentially the revelation of that form,
and of the nature of space-time as well as of the goal.
1. Aries.—The Light of Life Itself . This is the dim point of light found at
the centre of the cycle of manifestation, faint and flickering. It is the
“searchlight of the Logos, seeking that which can be used” for divine
expression.
2. Taurus.—The penetrating Light of the Path . This is a beam of light,
streaming forth from the point in Aries, and revealing the area of light
control.
3. Gemini.—The Light of Interplay . This is a line of light beams,
revealing that which opposes or the basic duality of manifestation, the
relationship of spirit and of form. It is the conscious light of that
relationship. Júpiter . Cancer.—The Light within the form. This is the diffused light of
substance itself, the “dark light” of matter, referred to in The Secret
Doctrine . It is the light awaiting the stimulation coming from the soul
light.
5. Leo.—The Light of the Soul . A reflected point of light logoic, or
divine. The light diffused in Cancer focusses and reveals eventually a
point.
6. Virgo.—The blended dual Light . Two lights are seen—bright and
strong, the light of form; one faint and dim, the light of God. This light is distinguished by a waxing of one and the waning of the other.
It differs from the light in Gemini. [330]
7. Libra.—The Light that moves to rest . This is the light that oscillates
until a point of balance is achieved. It is the light which is
distinguished by a moving up and down.
8. Scorpio.—The Light of Day . This is the place where three lights meet
—the light of form, the light of soul, and the light of life. They meet;
they blend; they rise. Mercúrio . Sagittarius.—A beam of directed, focussed Light . In this the point of
light becomes the beam, revealing a greater light ahead and illumining
the way to the centre of the light.
10. Capricorn.—The Light of Initiation . This is the light which clears the
way to the mountain top, and produces transfiguration, thus revealing
the rising sun.
11. Aquarius.—The Light that shines on Earth, across the sea . This is
the light which ever shines within the dark and cleansing with its
healing rays that which must be purified until the dark has gone.
12. Pisces.—The Light of the World . This is the light, revealing the light
of life itself. It ends for ever the darkness of matter.
A study of the above thoughts will reveal the symbolic story of the
irradiation of matter, of the growth of the light body within the macrocosm
and the microcosm, and finally make clear the purpose of the Logos.
It is because—speaking in parables—the light of Cancer is only diffused,
vague and inchoate that the influences of the first Ray of Focussed Intention
and of purposeful Will and of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom (recognised
duality and gained experience) are found to be missing. Their influences are
not present, except in so far that love and purpose underlie all manifestation.
But they are not focussed in this [331] sign. Only five rays play through this
constellation which even at a relatively high point of development and upon
the returning wheel preserves ever the mass relationship for the benefit of
the incarnating individual and in order to guarantee the ultimate salvation of substance itself. Human beings, without initiated vision, are apt to interpret
all the signs and their effects in terms of individual man, whereas the
purpose of their coordinated influence is both planetary, solar and cosmic.
The initiate who has taken the three lower initiations is occupied henceforth
with the effects of the cosmic influences upon the planet and incidentally
upon the fourth kingdom in nature and with the higher mental study of their
effects as they produce basic and fundamental changes in the systemic life
which, in its turn, affects our planet, its kingdoms in nature and incidentally
human beings. You can see from this, therefore, that as the evolutionary
changes are brought about and as human, planetary and solar consciousness
progressively develops, the influences pouring from the constellations, via
their intermediaries, the planets, will produce very diverse changes and
significant happenings to which man will consciously or unconsciously
respond according to his point of development. The response of the
individual Cancer subject to the incoming influences and to his environment
will be different to those of the disciple or initiate and these again will differ
in every sign, thus rounding out human development. Here again is a point
which astrologers will have later to take into consideration. I would here
like to give you a tabulation which will indicate somewhat the nature of the
response of the man during the three stages of his development—
undeveloped, advanced and upon the Path—to the various influences to
which he is subjected when he enters into physical plane existence through
the open door of Cancer, and proceeds then through all the signs. [332]

[334] You will note that these relationships between the signs are not those
of the opposites but intermediate signs and, therefore, marking the
intermediate period of relationship and not consummation as is the case
when such opposites as Leo and Aquarius or Cancer and Capricorn are
considered. These relationships, it will be found, create quite definite
geometrical forms just as the crosses, formed between the opposites create
the three crosses of the heavens. I commend this to your consideration. The
above tabulation gives you a new and inner relation of the signs to each
other and one which only becomes definitely active and effective after
initiation. It is consequently of small use to the average reader at this time,
though it opens up, nevertheless, new astrological contacts and influences
most of which are established through the ray influences and which require
a grasp of individual evolutionary status for correct interpretation. It is
essential, for their right understanding that the astrologer knows whether the
subject is relatively unevolved, whether he is an advanced man or whether
he is upon one or other stages of the Path. There is so much to be reckoned
with in the new esoteric astrology—prediction, interpretation from the
standpoint of both the personality and the soul, character indications, as well
as a close study of the Law of Rebirth as it can be arrived at through an
understanding of the influences of Cancer. One thing which will later
emerge, but which is at present impossible of elucidation, is the fact that the
twelve Creative Hierarchies are all connected with one or other of the
twelve signs of the zodiac and these all definitely affect the human family
and the unit in that family also. A close study of the relations indicated in
this new tabulation and a study also of the Hierarchies and the signs will
cause a drastic revolution in modern astrology and one of most basic
importance. More [335] than this I cannot here indicate and more will not
be possible until the present astrologers have done some concentrated work
along the lines here designated. Simple as it sounds when stated, the most fundamental point for astrologers
to grasp today is the need for them to know—prior to interpretation—where,
upon the path of evolution, the subject under consideration stands. One
other hint I will give. It will be from a study of those people who are born in
the Cardinal Signs that the clearest information will emerge in this
connection. It might be useful to point out here that:
1. Through a study of the Cardinal Cross—Aries, Cancer, Libra,
Capricorn—the astrologer can arrive at a clearer understanding:
a. Of ordinary, individual, human beings.
b. Of group beginnings.
c. Of the significance of the first initiation.
2. Through a study of the Fixed Cross—Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and
Aquarius—he will arrive at a right interpretation of the lives:
a. Of initiates.
b. Of group absorption into synthesis.
c. Of the significance of the third initiation.
3. Through a study of the Mutable Cross—Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius
and Pisces—he can arrive at the significance:
a. Of disciples.
b. Of group activity.
c. Of the second initiation.
The above indications may not conform to the ideas generally held, and
appear to reverse also some of the points [336] which I have earlier made,
but a careful study of the suggested implications may make the point clearer.
Every Cross has its exoteric significance and with this all astrologers are
somewhat familiar; it has also its esoteric meaning and import and this is as
yet an untried field of investigation; and it has its spiritual importance, and
this of course is only revealed at the major initiations. It should be
remembered that these are the threefold differentiations of the One Life and
that Capricorn, for instance, marks not only the point of the deepest concretion and therefore of death but also the point of highest initiation and
of entrance into the life aspect of deity.
I cannot too strongly reiterate the constant necessity for you to think in
terms of energies and forces, of lines of force, and energy relationships;
astrologers must also think more in terms of qualities and of characteristics,
as is the trend of the more advanced astrology today. The whole story of
astrology is, in reality, one of magnetic and magical interplay for the
production or externalisation of the inner reality; it is the story of the
response of form—vast as in a solar system, microcosmic as in a human
being, and minute as in an atom or a cell—to the urge or pull of foci of
energy and of streams of force. These two are not identical, but must be
taken into the calculations of the investigating astrologer and his
interpretations.
It is the focussed energy of Cancer which makes it a major magnetic or
attractive focal point leading to the processes of incarnation. Through the
door of Cancer streams the “magnetic magical light which guides the soul
into the dark place of experience.” Similarly, it is the magical pull of
Capricornian energy which upon the returning wheel (in contradistinction to
the wheel of rebirth or the outgoing wheel) of expression and of discipleship
draws the [337] soul steadily away from form life and experience and
constitutes that “radiant light which leads the soul in safety to the mountain
top.” In the recognition of this comes elucidation of the fact that in time and
space the controlling factor and determining condition is the sensitivity of
the incarnated soul to form life, leading to incarnation through the door of
Cancer, or to soul life, leading to initiation through the door of Capricorn. It
is also in the relation of these two signs to each other that you get one of the
clearest pictures of the interplay between the pairs of opposites as they exist
in the zodiac, and it might profit us here for a minute to study the two types
of consummation which this interplay between opposite signs brings about.
I will endeavour to put these for you in tabular and suggestive form for your
later consideration and study. The consummation on both the form side and the soul side might be expressed as follows, bearing ever in mind the
limitations of language:
ON THE WHEEL TURNING CLOCKWISE
(Aries to Taurus, via Pisces)
For ordinary humanity.
1. Aries-Libra.—Unstable embryonic beginnings leading to the
balancing of the lower psychic nature and its expression through
form. Embryonic desire for expression consummates in the passion of
satisfaction. Lower love controls.
2. Taurus-Scorpio.—Powerful focussed lower desire leads to death and
defeat. The triumph of the lower nature which eventuates in the
awakening to satiety and death. The man is the prisoner of desire and
at the moment of consummation knows his prison. [338]
3. Gemini-Sagittarius.—Fluid interplay and instability leads to
personality focus and determination. The man is one-pointedly
devoted to personality achievement. The threefold lower nature,
synthesised and directed controls all activity. Júpiter . Cancer-Capricorn.—The urge to incarnate leads to the densest
incarnation and immersion in form. The pull of form life and the
processes of concretisation control. The man arrives after many
incarnations at a point of crystallisation.
5. Leo-Aquarius.—The individual seeks full expression and arrives
finally at the point where he uses his environment for purely
individual ends. He dominates his fellowmen for entirely personality
objectives. The isolated individual becomes the group ruler or
dictator.
6. Virgo-Pisces.—Virgin matter attracts the soul and the divine Mother
becomes more important than the son. The life of the soul is hidden.
ON THE WHEEL TURNING ANTI-CLOCKWISE
(Aries to Pisces, via Taurus)
The Disciple and Initiate. 1. Libra-Aries.—The achieved equilibrium, at the point of rest, provides
the mental impetus for soul control. Passion is transmuted into love
and the initial desire of Aries becomes the full expression of lovewisdom. Desire to manifest becomes the aspiration to be.
2. Scorpio-Taurus.—The final victory of soul over form. Death and
darkness demonstrate as life and light as the result of this energy
relationship. The dark night of the soul becomes radiant sun. [339]
3. Sagittarius-Gemini.—The result of this related pair of opposites is that
there is one-pointed soul effort, spiritually directed activity and a
demonstrated readiness for initiation. There is the waning of the
power of form and the waxing of the life of the soul. Júpiter . Capricorn-Cancer.—The initiate now chooses to incarnate and passes
freely and at will through both doors. The pull of matter is superseded
by the free choice of the soul. Form life becomes a conscious method
of expression for service.
5. Aquarius-Leo.—Personality interests as an expression of the
individual are submerged in the good of the whole. Selfish individual
man becomes the world server. Heights of noted service are then
reached in both signs.
6. Pisces-Virgo.—The form reveals and releases the indwelling soul. The
Saviour of the world appears and nurtures the hidden souls in Virgo.
You will, therefore, note that when the pull of the energies pouring into and
through the signs of the zodiac is in the direction of form expression that the
result of the interplay between the opposite signs leads to some aspect of
definite personality manifestation, this being largely determined by the ray
of the personality. When the life tendency is being withdrawn from form
and the soul is in process of revelation then there is soul or egoic emphasis,
and this again is determined, as to quality, by the nature of the egoic ray.
Here again will appear the necessity for a knowledge of the point in
evolution of the individual whose horoscope is under consideration. I would
indicate at this point that in studying any of the signs it will be wise to study
at the same time its opposite or consummating sign. Much that I could, for instance, say in connection with the sign, Cancer, has already [340] been
said in connection with its opposite, Capricorn, and the same will be true of
all the signs which we are now going to study.
It will now be clear to you why the Moon and Neptune, transmitting the
energies of the psychic nature and of form, plus the tendency to achieve
through the medium of conflict, rule Cancer so potently, both directly and
indirectly. They control the form and the lower psychic nature and produce
the battle ground (later to be transmuted into the burning ground) whereon
these two “face in the final conflict” their higher correspondence, the soul
and spirit, for matter is spirit at its lowest point and spirit is matter at its
highest. In these words you have the true clue to the Cancer-Capricorn
relationship. When to these potent influences is added the force of the
seventh ray (producing a synthesis of expression upon the physical plane)
and of the third ray (producing intense activity in matter) you will note how
in this sign all the energies concerned tend to bring about the incarnation of
the soul in the three worlds of experience and human expression. The power
of Venus in this sign tends to make the mind the servant of the personality
and this is aided by the forces of the third Ray of Active Intelligence. Thus
the stage is set for the appearance of the soul in form. You would find it an
interesting study to compare the effects of these ray potencies as they find
expression in Cancer upon:
1. The unevolved man as he demonstrates form control.
2. The evolved man, initiate and Saviour as he demonstrates soul control.
The forces which controlled the soul whilst dominated by form
become the instruments of world service.
[341] As these results are studied, you will eventually arrive at an insight
into the relationships we touched upon earlier when we discussed the rulers
of this sign—exoteric and esoteric—which brought the Cancer subject into
contact with Virgo, Aquarius and Scorpio. From one point of view, you have
the imprisonment of the soul and the glorification of the personality
demonstrated, ending with death in Scorpio; in the other you have the
revelation of the Christ within the form, the revelation of the serving individual and the revelation of the final victory over death. When to the
above recognitions you add the place which the planets hold in this sign,
you have a most remarkable and at the same time rather abstruse situation
indicated and—because this is the final cross of initiation—one which will
only become really clear when the final stages of the path are trodden.
Therefore, only a few hints are possible. Two planets are exalted in this
sign, Jupiter and Neptune. As this is the sign of rebirth, these two planets
indicate the successful development and eventual use of the form aspect and
the development of psychic sensitivity both in the higher and the lower
senses.
These are important developments for the soul who has chosen to incarnate.
The building of adequate forms and the use and control of form are essential
if there is to be wise and right cooperation with the Plan of God. Jupiter
guarantees this in Cancer from the very initial stage of birth. Love as
relationship to divinity and wisdom as relationship to form lie behind the
soul's intent. In space and time, for long aeons, form controls and hides the
soul. This is equally true in regard to the fluid psychic nature. These (the
form aspect and the psychic nature) reach an eventual concrete perfection in
Capricorn to become again in Cancer the perfect [342] instrument of service
which the initiate wields as he seeks to render mass service instead of being
involved and lost in the mass. The power of Saturn in this sign furthers the
ends and purposes of the governing energies or rays of harmony through
conflicts (the Moon and Mercury) and of Neptune, for in this sign Saturn is
in the home of its detriment and thus produces those difficult conditions and
situations which will lead to the needed struggle. This makes Cancer a place
of symbolic imprisonment and emphasises the pains and penalties of wrong
orientation. It is the conflict of the soul with its environment—consciously
or unconsciously carried on—which leads to the penalties of incarnation and
which provides those conditions of suffering which the soul has willingly
undertaken when—with open eyes and clear vision—the soul chose the path
of earth life with all its consequent sacrifices and pains, in order to salvage
the lives with which it had an affinity. Curiously it is Sepharial who places the rulers of the decanates more
accurately than does Leo. Usually this is reversed and Leo is the more
correct of the two astrologers. Sepharial gives us Venus, Mercury and the
Moon whereas Leo apportions the Moon, Mars and Jupiter to these
decanates. The mind, the uses of conflict and form life are the contributing
factors, leading the soul along the way of incarnation. The instrument of
release is, in the last analysis, the right use and control of the organ of
illumination which is the mind. Hence the necessary emphasis ever laid
upon meditation when the aspirant awakens to spiritual opportunity. The
strength which comes through conflict and constant struggle builds up
steadily that reserve of strength and power which enables the aspirant to
take the final tests of discipleship in Scorpio and to brave in Capricorn the
[343] trials of initiation and the breaking of all the bonds which the
processes of incarnation have forged.
In the Words given for this sign, the Word of the soul indicates the objective
of the Cancer experience and the purpose for which incarnation has been
taken: “I build a lighted house and therein dwell.” The temporary method of
the personality is also clearly given when we are told that the Word
proclaimed by the soul as it takes incarnation is “Let isolation be the rule
and yet—the crowd exists.”
This sign can carry deep meaning to all. You are in process of incarnation;
you are following your chosen way. Is the house you are building yet lit? Is
it a lighted house, or is it a dark prison? If it is a lighted house, you will
attract to its light and warmth all who are around you and the magnetic pull
of your soul, whose nature is light and love, will save many. If you are still
an isolated soul, you will have to pass through the horrors of a more
complete isolation and loneliness, treading alone the dark way of the soul.
Yet this isolation, this loneliness and this separation in the dark night are all
part of the Great Illusion. It is, however, an illusion into which the whole of
humanity is now precipitated in preparation for unity, freedom and release.
Some are lost in the illusion and know not what is reality and truth. Others walk free in the world of illusion for the purposes of saving and lifting their
brothers, and if you cannot do this, you will have to learn so to walk. GEMINI, THE TWINS
In the consideration of the remaining signs there will be relatively less to
say than before, because I have already pointed out many facts and points
when dealing with their polar opposites. Much, therefore, that can be said
about [344] the sign Gemini has been dealt with under Sagittarius; Virgo
and Pisces have also been considered in relation to this sign, because all
these four signs form together the Mutable Cross. A certain amount of
repetition is necessary and often helpful; it serves to clarify and reinforce
when one is teaching, but I would like now to be more general and—in
dealing with these three signs which indicate the subjective realities which
incite the form-taking in Cancer—to consider pre-disposing causes more
than detailed and more easily ascertained facts.
In this world cycle, Gemini, Taurus and Aries are three subjective energies
or the three conditioning signs which lie behind manifestation. They lie
behind the form-taking experience in Cancer and they also lie behind
manifestation in Pisces. Pisces is the sign with which the modern world (and
by that I refer to an immense long period of time) is primarily concerned,
for Pisces is the starting point on the clockwise wheel at this time for the
greater zodiacal round of approximately 25,000 years—the date of which
beginning is not yet revealed to the modern astrologer or subject to
revelation through his science. As we study Gemini and Taurus (Aries we
have already considered) let us bear in mind their cause-initiating nature and
the fact that they have a more specifically psychic effect and subjective
influence than their strictly phenomenal and physical effects would lead one
to imagine.
You will find, I think, that it is these hints and suggestions which are of the
most importance in launching and in utilising the new esoteric astrology.
Students would do well to isolate first of all the broad general statements
anent the zodiacal signs and influence before they take up the intensive study of the detailed and new informative suggestions which I may have
given. A grasp of the universals, [345] prior to a study of the particulars, is
ever a wise occult procedure.
In each of the Crosses of the Heavens there is one sign and influence which,
in any world cycle, dominates the other three. Such dominating effects
necessarily change when a world cycle changes, but for the present cycle,
Gemini determines the paramount influence within the fourfold influence of
the Mutable Cross. The main objective of these four energies is to produce
that constant flux and periodic change in time and space which will provide
a field of adequate experience for the unfoldment of the Christ life and
consciousness. This is the case cosmically speaking, and also from the
standpoint of a solar system, of a planet and of a human being. The field of
development for the lower three kingdoms is dependent upon the status and
energy-distributing power of humanity as a whole. We might, therefore,
recognise the following facts anent the Mutable Cross:
Gemini.—This is the force which produces the changes needed for the
evolution of the Christ consciousness at any particular point in time
and space. It is always compatible to the requirement.
Virgo.—This is the nurturing force of substance itself, subject to the nine
cyclic changes of the cosmic gestation period; it fosters and protects
the embryonic Christ life, preparing for manifestation or a divine
incarnation.
Sagittarius.—Is the energetic activity of the life force, demonstrating at
the sixth month, when—esoterically speaking—the three aspects of
the form nature and the three aspects of the soul are integrated and
functioning. It is this integration which sometimes makes the sixth
month of physical human gestation so critical.
Pisces.—This is the life expression and active appearance [346] of the
Christ consciousness in form; it is also the energetic appearance
(symbolically speaking) of a world saviour. This Mutable Cross is, therefore, peculiarly a Christian symbol and
significantly connected with the Christ life and with the unfoldment of a
world saviour and is particularly potent during the anti-clockwise turning of
the Great Wheel. This fact will emerge more clearly when astrologers are
able to determine accurately the point of development and the spiritual
status of the subject whose horoscope is under consideration. The formless
nature of the influences of Gemini is strikingly borne out if the significance
of Masonry is studied. This world-wide institution was—as I have earlier
told you—organised under the influence and impulse of this sign and is
governed by it in a most unusual manner. The format or exoteric symbolism
of Masonry has frequently been changed during the millenia of years
through which it has been active. Its present Jewish colouring is relatively
modern and not necessarily enduring, but its significance and its history of
unfoldment are the history of the indwelling Christ consciousness and of
that inner light, and this must unalterably be continued. That which has
entered through the two pillars of Hercules, the disciples (Jachin and Boaz),
and through the sign Gemini, has entered to stay.
Apart from the importance of the influences of Gemini as the dominant
power in the Mutable Cross, it is one of the paramount zodiacal signs in that
it is the major symbol of duality in the zodiac. It is the constellation Gemini
and its inherent second ray influence which control every one of the pairs of
opposites in the Great Wheel. Gemini, therefore, forms with each of the
pairs of opposites in the Zodiac a third factor, powerfully influencing the
other two constellations, [347] and thus forms, with them, certain great
zodiacal triangles. These only become of importance when considering the
horoscopes of advanced human beings or esoteric groups, but eventually—
when casting the horoscope of a disciple or an initiate—the esoteric
astrologer will have to consider their potency. For instance, in the case of an
initiate whose Sun is in Leo, the triangle of constellation energies
determining the interpretation of the horoscope would be Leo-AquariusGemini. When dealing with a subject whose Sun is in Gemini itself, the
conditioning triangle would be Gemini-Sagittarius and Pisces—the latter
forming a part of this triangle because it marks both the end and the beginning and is, for this great cycle of the zodiac, the Alpha and the
Omega. These points I will endeavour to elucidate in greater detail when
taking up with you the basic astrological Science of Triangles. The
generalisations and the hints in connection with the twelve signs of the
zodiac which have formed the subject matter of our past instructions have
been primarily intended to lay the ground and to prepare your minds for the
later section upon triangles; this will be far the most important aspect of the
teaching on esoteric astrology and the one which will be the first to be
grasped by modern astrology.
This sign is sometimes called the “constellation of the resolution of duality
into a fluid synthesis.” Governing as it does all the pairs of opposites in the
zodiac, it preserves the magnetic interplay between them, keeping them
fluid in their relations, in order eventually to facilitate their transmutation
into unity, for the two must finally become the One. It should be
remembered that—from the angle of the final development of the twelve
zodiacal potencies—the twelve opposites must become the blended six, and
this is brought about by the fusion in consciousness of the polar [348]
opposites. Pause and consider this phrasing. The opposites eternally remain
from the point of view of human reason, but to the initiate whose intuition is
functioning they constitute but six great potencies, because he has achieved
“the freedom of the two,” as it is sometimes called. For instance, the Leo
subject who has an initiated consciousness preserves the individuality,
developed in Leo, as well as the universality of Aquarius; he can function, if
he so chooses, as a fully self-identified individual, yet possesses
simultaneously a fully awakened universal awareness; the same thing can be
said of balanced activity and consequent fusion in all the signs. This
analysis constitutes in itself an interesting and far-reaching field of
speculation.
Gemini is, therefore, one of the most important of the twelve signs and its
influence lies behind everyone of them—a fact but little realised as yet by
astrologers. This will be more fully understood when the triangle of Gemini
and two opposing signs is studied. Because the Ray of Love-Wisdom, the second ray, pours through Gemini it becomes apparent how true is the occult
teaching that love underlies the entire universe. God is love, we are assured,
and this statement is both an exoteric and an esoteric truth. This underlying
love of Deity reaches our solar system primarily through Gemini, which
forms, with the constellation of the Great Bear and the Pleiades, a cosmic
triangle. This is the triangle of the cosmic Christ and is the esoteric symbol
lying behind the cosmic Cross. There is ever the eternal triangle to be found
behind the fourfold phenomenal appearance. Speaking symbolically and in
the words of the Old Commentary :
“Upon the golden triangle, the cosmic Christ appeared; His head in
Gemini; one foot upon the field [349] of the Seven Fathers and the other
planted in the field of the Seven Mothers (these two constellations are
sometimes called the Seven Brothers and the Seven Sisters. A.A.B.).
Thus for aeons, the Great One stood, His consciousness inturned, aware
of three but not of four. Intent, with suddenness, He heard a sound go
forth.... Arousing to that cry, He stretched Himself, reached forth both
arms in understanding love, and, lo, the Cross was formed.
“He heard the cry of the Mother (Virgo), of the Seeker (Sagittarius),
and of the submerged Fish (Pisces). Then, lo, the Cross of change
appeared, though Gemini remained the head. This is the mystery.”
In this occult statement is hidden one reason why Gemini is regarded as an
air sign, for it is cosmically related (as are Libra and Aquarius, the other two
points of the airy triplicity) in a most peculiar way to the Great Bear, to the
Pleiades and to Sirius. The relation is essentially a sixfold one, and here you
will find a hint as to the resolution of the pairs of opposites—involving as
these three constellations do the three ideas of opposition-equilibriumsynthesis or universal fusion. It might be stated that:
1. Gemini—forms a point of entrance for cosmic energy from Sirius.
2. Libra—is related to and transmits the potencies of the Pleiades.
3. Aquarius—expresses the universal consciousness of the Great Bear. It might be profitable to you to bear in mind at this point what I have often
told you, that the great White Lodge on [350] Sirius is the spiritual
prototype of the great White Lodge on Earth, of which modern Masonry is
the distorted reflection, just as the personality is a distorted reflection of the
soul. I would also remind you again of the relation between Gemini and
Masonry to which reference has frequently been made.
A close consideration of what I have said above will serve to emphasise in
your consciousness the importance of this constellation, Gemini, and the
inner significance of the Mutable Cross. All the constellations on this Cross
mark points of change or are the custodians of those energies which produce
the needed periods of re-orientation, preparatory to fresh developments and
new activities. It might be of interest if I pointed out that:
1. The Mutable Cross—brings about those conditions which will produce
great periods of change in the life of the planet, of a kingdom in
nature or of a human being. Mercury plays a part in this.
2. The Fixed Cross—brings about, as a sequence, to these inner changes,
certain great points of crisis which are unavoidable and present
definite opportunity. Saturn is dominant in bringing this about.
3. The Cardinal Cross—is responsible for bringing about certain great
points of synthesis , as a consequence of both change and crisis.
Jupiter is responsible for the focussing of energies at this point.
I will enlarge upon this later, but the above will give you (even in this brief
form) certain positive ideas of great importance, and will indicate certain
situations which can be looked for in the lives of those whose Sun is in one
or other of these signs and on one or other of these Crosses.
[351] In the expression of the activity of this sign of duality, it is subjective
energy we must consider as it produces objective effects. This sign controls
esoterically the heart of our solar system and thus controls the pulsation of
life which sustains all that is. Gemini is, therefore, connected with the heart
of the Sun, just as Cancer is related to the physical Sun and Aquarius to the
central spiritual Sun. Here again, you have a significant triangle of a cosmic nature, the energies of which are focussed through the three aspects of the
Sun in a most mysterious fashion:
1. Cancer . . .
2. Gemini . . .
3. Aquarius . . physical Sun . . . . . . .
heart of the Sun . . . . .
central spiritual Sun. . 3rd aspect . . .
2nd aspect . . .
1st aspect . . . intelligent activity of the Whole.
love of the Whole.
the will of the Whole. Through these signs the three major aspects of divinity are at this time
focussed. In casting the horoscope of the planet (a thing that has never yet
been accurately done, owing to the lack of data available to the exoteric
astrologer) it is the influence of these three constellations which will be
found of dominating importance. In Cancer , you have the intelligent
synthetic consciousness of the mass, viewing it from the consciousness of
matter itself and the awareness of all forms and atoms; in Gemini , you have
an emerging recognition of duality, leading to experience and growth in all
separative intelligent forms; in Aquarius , you have the results of the
activity of Cancer and Gemini, producing a higher synthesis and a universal
group awareness. This the intelligent student can trace with moderate
facility in relation to humanity, but it applies equally to all forms in all
kingdoms of nature and also to planetary and solar expression. The proved
reality of this is one of the developments of the initiatory process at the end
of the long, long path [352] of evolution. Attraction and repulsion are
therefore conditioning factors in our solar life, and this conditioning reaches
us through Gemini. It is the effect of a cosmic energy at present unknown to
humanity. The waxing and the waning light which distinguishes soul
experience from the first faint move towards incarnation and Earth
experience, the rise and fall of civilisations and the growth and unfoldment
of all cyclic manifestations are produced by the “interplay between the two
brothers,” as it is called. In that far-off time when the greater round of the
zodiac was started in Gemini, as now it is in Pisces, there was a relation
between the waxing and the waning moon, due to the pulsating power of
Gemini. This is now greatly lessened, owing to the removal of the
responsive life from the Moon, but the rhythm then set up still remains,
producing the same basic illusion. I am talking here in terms of ancient facts and not in terms of reflection, as is now the case. I refer to realities and not
to shadows.
Gemini, as you may now begin to grasp, is related to the etheric body; it is
the custodian of conditioning energy and the intermediary, as far as basic
essentials are concerned, between soul and body. These are the two allied
brothers. In the average person, the etheric vehicle is the transmitter of
psychic energy, galvanising and coordinating the dense physical body and
permitting, therefore, astral and mental control of the personality. When the
man is upon the Path of Discipleship and, therefore, upon the reversed
wheel, leading to initiation, the etheric body becomes the transmitter of soul
energy and not of personality force; the powerful effect of the second Ray of
Love-Wisdom—working through the subjective six rays, according to ray
type—begins steadily to dominate the vital body, producing consequently
the shift of force and of intensity to the [353] centres above the diaphragm.
The power of the personality lessens and wanes whilst that of the soul
waxes and grows. There is much to be learned from the study of the dual
activity—higher and lower—of the etheric body and its relation to and
responsiveness to the constellation, Gemini, but it is too abstruse for the
ordinary student. It is nevertheless an esoteric fact to be borne in mind and
will be some day of real service to the astrology of the future, for some day
astrology will be lifted up to a higher plane. True interpretation will come
and true healing in all departments of human living through a proper
understanding of the available potencies and energies pouring into the
planet at any particular time.
We come now to a consideration of the Rulers of this sign and there is much
to be learnt from a study of them. The orthodox ruler is Mercury who, as the
Messenger of the Gods or the “divine Intermediary, carries messages
between the poles with speed and light.” In this most potent and important
planet the idea of duality is again to he found, enhancing and enhanced by
the influence of Gemini. Mercury is the expression of the dual aspect of the
mind as it mediates between the higher and the lower. This mediation again
falls into two stages: the use of the concrete mind as the mediator within the personality, conditioning the personality life, analysing and distinguishing
between the human self and the not-self and emphasising the “me and thou”
consciousness as well as that of the personality and its environment.
Secondly, it carries the messages between the soul and the brain and
establishes right relation between the lower self and the higher self; it is,
therefore, the illumined mind, relating soul and personality. This process of
the higher relationship is carried forward with rapidity upon the Path of
Discipleship. There is a third [354] aspect of Mercury which begins to
function when the other two are perfected or in process of rapid perfecting.
Mercury, in this case, is the abstract mind—removed from all form contact
as we understand it—and relates soul and spirit, and this again in two
stages. Mercury is the revealer of the Spiritual Triad (atma-buddhi-manas or
spiritual will, spiritual love and the higher mind) to the soul, and this carries
the disciples to the stage of the third initiation. It is then the revealer of the
life aspect during the processes of the higher initiations, but upon these it is
not necessary for us to enlarge.
In a peculiar way, therefore, Mercury increases in the Gemini subject the
latent sense of duality in its various stages and also the sense of distinction,
leading to that mental agility and that fluidity of mind which is one of the
major assets as well as one of the major difficulties of this sign. This agility
has, however, to be rightly understood and handled. When there is facility of
mental approach in any direction and in connection with the many opposites
in manifestation, you have the emergence of the divine Messenger in his
true character, able to comprehend extremes and to relate them divinely to
each other. Gemini is pre-eminently the sign of the messenger, and this sign
produces many of the messengers of God as they appear down the ages, the
revealers of new divine truths and the intermediaries between the fourth and
fifth kingdoms.
It is for this reason that you have the exoteric ruler given as Mercury and the
esoteric ruler as Venus, for they embody between them the energies of the
fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict and the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science which is embryonic understanding of causes and
conditions resulting therefrom and also of the Plan.
Again you find the note of duality in the relationship [355 ] (established by
the activity of these two rulers) between the third kingdom of nature, the
animal kingdom and the kingdom of God or of souls, the fifth kingdom in
nature, thus producing the fourth or human kingdom. Between these two the
influences play from Sagittarius to Gemini and vice versa. It was the activity
of Venus—under the influence of Gemini—which produced the great crisis
of the individualisation when the two kingdoms “approached” each other.
Venus, Mercury and the Earth then set up a magnetic field which made the
intervention of the Great Lodge on Sirius and the dual stimulation of
Gemini effective in producing significant results of which the fourth
kingdom in nature is the expression. The fact that Gemini is the third sign
and embodies what is called “a third potency” enabled it to reach, with its
force, the third kingdom and produce that reaction which resulted in the
individualising or the humanising of its higher forms of life. You will note
that Venus is also the hierarchical ruler of Capricorn, thus showing the
power of the mind and its place and purpose in connection with both the
major human crises: Individualisation and Initiation. It relates humanity in
an unique way to Gemini. In the coming world religion this fact will be
noted and in the month of June, which is essentially the month in which the
influences of Gemini are peculiarly strong, due advantage will be taken in
order to bring man nearer to the spiritual realities. Just as Venus was potent
in producing the relation of such pairs of opposites as the fifth kingdom of
souls and the third kingdom (the synthesis of the sub-human kingdoms)
leading to a Great Approach between soul and form, so in the new world
religion this fact will be recognised. Appeal will be made to the Forces
which can utilise this planetary potency in order to work out the divine plan
upon the Earth. It is because Venus thus [356] relates certain pairs of
opposites that she has been erroneously connected in the minds of men with
sex and the sex life and with the relation of the physical opposites, male and
female. It is interesting to discover that the hierarchical ruler of Gemini is the Earth
itself, which is a non-sacred planet. The Earth is also the esoteric ruler of
Sagittarius, the polar opposite of Gemini. These are the only two
constellations ruled by the Earth, and this fact is of major significance,
creating an unusual situation in the solar system and a unique relation. The
cosmic line of force from Gemini to Sagittarius and the reverse is
subjectively and esoterically related to our Earth, thus guaranteeing its soul
development, the unfoldment of form as an expression of that soul, and
leading our sorrowful humanity upon this woeful planet inevitably to the
very gate of initiation in Capricorn.
In this statement and in the fact of the pain and sorrow which are
distinguishing qualities of our planetary life lies hid a secret mystery.
Through this relationship and through the medium of the potencies pouring
into our planet, a situation is set up which I might express in the words of
the Old Commentary :
“When the dual forces of the cosmic brothers (Gemini) become the
energy of the one who rides towards the light (Sagittarius) then the fourth
becomes the fifth. Humanity, the link, becomes the Hierarchy, the
bestower of all good. Then all the Sons of God rejoice.”
A slight study will show you that you have in these three rulers a most
interesting sequence of forces, for Rays 3, Júpiter , and 5 produce a synthesis of
activity and of [357] eager potencies which are essential for the
development of humanity. In this world cycle and for humanity as it is now
constituted you have:
1. Ray 3.—Active Intelligence, under the influence of this third sign,
Gemini, slowly conditioning the etheric body.
2. Ray Júpiter .—Harmony through Conflict, under the influence of GeminiSagittarius, staging those situations upon the astral plane which will
produce the conflict in the astral body which is essential to the final
treading of the burning ground and subsequent release. 3. Ray 5.—Concrete Knowledge or Science, under the influence of
Capricorn, focussed through Venus, which will enable the man to take
initiation.
These three energies, focussed through the three planets governing Gemini,
are essentially dedicated to the development of the fourth kingdom in nature
and are polarised in the Earth, itself one of the rulers.
Mercury, the star of conflict, is also the major planet of relationships, for it
governs and “engineers” (if I may use such a term) the interplay between
our Earth with its conditioning constellations. In the case of Gemini, it
relates our small planet to Virgo (Mutable Cross), to Aries (Cardinal Cross)
and to Scorpio (Fixed Cross), and its mission, therefore, emerges as one of
supreme importance. Through the medium of this inter-relation and
consequent intercourse, the three cosmic Crosses become closely related
and, in Gemini, certain of the fundamental zodiacal influences—synthesised
and coordinated—are focussed upon our planet. This produces strain, action
and reaction, and that condition of potent struggle and of difficulty which is
so characteristic of our planetary life, but which produces eventually the
awakening of humanity to full planetary consciousness, [358] and, in the
case of the planetary Logos, to full cosmic consciousness.
This effect is most powerful in Gemini owing to the fact that the two arms
of the Mutable Cross are thus related, and the result of the activity of
Mercury as it rules Gemini is to produce a steady pull between the pairs of
opposites; in Virgo it produces that interior struggle between the exoteric
not-self and the esoteric self, between the form-consciousness (planetary,
human and subhuman) and the soul within all forms. In considering this
subject you will have to consider the following astrological formations:
1. Gemini . . . . . . . . . . .
2. Gemini . . . . . . . . . . .
3. Gemini . . . . . . . . . . . Virgo . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Earth
Aries . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Earth
Scorpio . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Earth Mercury.
Mercury.
Mercury. The importance of these triple formations being based on the fact that they
are conditioning triangles, with the energies of two constellations focussed
through Mercury upon the Earth, i.e. The potencies of Gemini-Aries, instilled into our planetary life via Mercury,
focus the energy of the conditioning will-to-be upon the Earth, producing
initial beginnings [359] as in incarnation, or initiation, or the start of
organisation as well as organisms. It should be remembered that there is the
will-to-be in form and the will-to-be free from form, but all these aspects of
will are achieved through conflict and interplay of which energy both
Gemini and Mercury are the eternal symbols.
Mercury, as it relates Gemini to Scorpio and to our planet, has a mass or
general effect, for it is the hierarchical ruler of Scorpio and its effect is of a
planetary nature far more than is usually the case, and is, therefore, far more
difficult to trace at our present point of planetary development and human
consciousness. Its true significance will not be understood until the
consciousness of individual man is also planetary in its scope and grasp,
which is never the case until after the third initiation. I have here
emphasised two of these relationships between the constellations and the
Earth even though it is not possible for you to grasp the implications. So
often in our studies, one is apt to forget that it is not possible for any unit of
consciousness, within the planetary sphere of influence, to conceive of
conditions as they exist apart from the Earth because that small planet is
inevitably for that unit the very centre of his known universe and—under
the Great Illusion—the constellations with their rulers and with their prototypal counterparts revolve around the Earth. When man has progressed
further and his consciousness is beginning to awaken to reality, the nature of
this illusion will become apparent to him, but at present this is not possible.
Even theoretically it is not possible. Study, for instance, what I can still
further add as to the influence of these related constellations and see
whether it truly conveys to you any exact knowledge beyond a general idea
of focussed energies and related forces. Let me, therefore, add:
[360] The influence of Mercury, as it relates Aries and Gemini to our Earth,
establishes in time and space a unique situation, for it incites to trial efforts
or initiates a series of beginnings in order to relate opposing forces and
produce certain planned and definite effects upon our planet, thus
influencing the kingdoms in nature or an individual soul-in-form. A conflict
is thus initiated which leads finally to balance.
This leads to an intermediate consummation in Libra.
The influence of Mercury as it relates Virgo and Gemini is to condition the
soul within the form and subject it to those influences which will lead to the
intensification of the ordinary evolutionary process and the consequent
waxing of the soul light and the waning of the light in matter itself. This
initiates the struggle which, in a human being, is consciously realised as
being between soul and personality.
This leads to a final stage in Capricorn.
The influence of Mercury as it relates Scorpio and Gemini is to inaugurate
that final stage in consciousness which will place the soul within the form
surely in the place of power, swinging the earlier achieved balance and
control definitely into the realm of the soul. It is this which, in the Scorpio
experience, produces the terrific experience of the disciple and which, at this
time, is one of the predisposing causes of the present world conflict. It is of
interest to note that the struggle is going to be conditioned primarily by
decisions arrived at in London (which is ruled by Gemini) and in the United
States (which is also governed by Gemini). Humanity is now upon the Path
of Discipleship as I have frequently told you and Scorpio rules that path; Gemini governs the way of many changes which conditions the struggle
which began in Aries, focussed in Cancer, is brought to [361] a crisis in
Scorpio and ended in Capricorn. When Gemini, Scorpio and Mercury are
correctly related we shall see the United States moving also on to the Path
of Discipleship through a release from its present self-centred policy, its
well-meaning evasion of responsibility and its innate fears and distrust.
When the focus of the power in London is also rightly oriented and is
released into increased effectiveness by drastic purification of motive, then
the united effect of both these clarifications will be human liberation. These
facts are being slowly realised in London, ahead of the realisation which is
more slowly awakening in the States.
These potencies, when effective, lead to true service in Aquarius.
All this activity is intensified by two facts: one is that the Earth is the
hierarchical ruler of Gemini and the other that Venus is the esoteric ruler.
This intensifies all that goes on and leads to the unfoldment upon our planet
of the consciousness of universality—to which the word “Hierarchy” is the
key. Venus is also the Earth's alter ego, as it is called in the occult literature,
and its true supplementary and complementary planet. You have thus
established a double dual relationship: that of Gemini itself, the two
brothers, and that of the Earth and Venus. The Earth is peculiarly related to
the “brother whose light is waning,” for it is not a sacred planet, as you
know, and to that aspect of divinity which is material or substantial; Venus
is closely related to the “brother whose light grows stronger cycle by cycle”
and thus to the soul whose nature is love. It is this Gemini-Venus situation
which lies behind the fact that our Earth is uniquely the “planet of releasing
sorrow and of purifying pain,” the energy producing these releasing factors
being focussed through Mercury and Venus upon our Earth. You will see,
therefore, the significance of that triangle of planets [362] (at which I hinted
in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire ): the Earth-Venus-Mercury. From certain
angles, these are related to the Personality of our planetary Logos:
1. The Earth—planetary vital body.
2. Venus—planetary astral vehicle, or Kama-manas. 3. Mercury—planetary mind.
The Earth itself is, on a small scale, also an intermediary or a relating planet,
because it is found ruling both Gemini and Sagittarius and is potent,
therefore, only within the line of this dual relationship, existing between this
particular pair of opposites. In the Earth a great balancing process is going
forward between two great streams of cosmic energy, emanating the one
from Sagittarius and the other from Gemini. This condition, aided and
influenced by Mercury and Venus, produces the somewhat unusual situation
in our planet.
Venus also establishes an interplay between Taurus, Gemini, Libra and
Capricorn, which again (because the Earth is one of the rulers of Gemini)
produces the “desperate conflict of the imprisoned soul upon the astral
plane” which characterises our planetary life. These four-fold influences and
relationships produce the minor initiations of the astral plane which ever
precede the major initiations in Capricorn, in their turn prepared for in
Scorpio. Taurus pours the energy stimulating desire, via Venus, onto our
Earth; Gemini, via Venus, awakens in humanity (the focal point of our
planetary effort) the sense of duality which is the basic factor in the conflict
between desire and spiritual will; in Libra this reaches a point of balance
wherein the one who struggles sees the issues clearly and achieves a
desirable point of equilibrium through the wise use of the Mercury-Venus
mind, ensuring the success of its final efforts in Capricorn. [363] You will
note, therefore, how necessary it is to realise accurately the point in
evolution of the soul.
The three planets ruling and conditioning Gemini (through out-drawn
activity, though not through their own influence) are in this third sign
effective in constituting this dual sign a working triplicity; it is the aid they
give to our Earth which produces the appearance in form of the dual
energies of soul and the subjective psychic personality. Ponder on this. It is
the energies of the fifth, fourth and third rays, pouring through Venus,
Mercury and the Earth, which are productive of the eternally recurring, divine triplicity and its work of releasing the soul from the influence of
form.
We have here considered the rays which directly affect our planet, the Earth,
which are focussed through the three ruling planets and which emanate from
certain of the constellations. In the last analysis, the planet is the result or
the effect (should I say, resultant effect) of the ray influence, just as in the
human being the physical body is the effect of the governing rays. Through
the planets certain potencies manifest. These are three in number, and I
might here point out that the sacred planets—so-called—are those ray
potencies which are expressive of soul and spirit, with the personality ray of
the great informing Life, the planetary Logos, subordinated to the two
higher rays, such as is the case with the man after the third initiation. A nonsacred planet, such as the Earth, is still subject to the ray of the personality
of the informing Life, and the correspondence to the esoteric monadic ray is
non-effective.
Indirectly, Gemini is ruled by the rays transmitting those potencies which,
with Gemini, constitute the Mutable Cross. These are the Moon, Jupiter,
Mars and Pluto. They transmit energies expressive of the fourth, second,
sixth and first [364] rays. Only one ray is, therefore, lacking where Gemini
is concerned, and that is the seventh Ray of Organization, Ceremonial
Magic and Ritual. This accounts for the instability and the fluidity of the
Gemini influence, and is largely responsible for the frequent failure of the
Gemini person to express the beauty, ideals, etc., which are sensed so that
they materialise upon the physical plane. The seventh ray produces fixation
upon the exoteric level of experience and “anchors” (if I may use such a
term) the ray forces into form, producing concrete expression of the
subjective realities or powers. Six forces meet in Gemini and, for this
reason, the double triangle or King Solomon's seal is one of the subjective
symbols of this sign, linking it again with the Masonic tradition and
indicating also again the essential dualism of this sign.
All the inner potencies are, therefore, present and only the stabilising
seventh ray energy is omitted from the dowry of the man born in Gemini. Thus we can easily account for the versatility of the Gemini subject. The
effectiveness of Mercury is also enhanced in its interpretive aspect because
the Gemini person can always find points of contact with people on nearly
every ray. This is an interesting point to remember if you will realise that the
great Masonic ritual was inaugurated under the influence of this sign, and
yet—the ray of ritual was omitted. This is due to the fact of reaction,
producing opposition and therefore interplay and struggle. Hence the tests
and trials of the Masonic procedure.
The indirect influence of the Moon as it symbolically embodies the fourth
Ray of Harmony through Conflict provides Mercury with the dual tendency
to struggle, which is characteristic of this sign, and also the dual tendency to
harmony which is the inevitable result of all spiritual conflict. [365] In
connection with the duality of conflict, you should bear in mind that there is
a conflict of the evolutionary process, leading finally to the conflict upon the
Path. These are the two aspects of struggle: unconscious and under the
direction of the form; and conscious, or under the direction of the soul.
There is also the harmonising of the personality and the achieving of
personality integration; this is a consequence or goal of the first conflict, and
then there is the attaining of harmony between soul and form; this is arrived
at by the struggle upon the final stages of the Path.
Thus again the essential dualism of this sign becomes apparent. When the
Jupiter influence becomes strong and powerful in this sign, it indicates the
initiate and the rapidly attained “dualism in synthesis” of soul and spirit.
Through the activity of Mercury, the man whose Sun is in Gemini is aided
to attain the synthesis of soul and form; through the activity of Jupiter, the
man whose rising sign is Gemini is enabled to attain the conscious
integration of soul and spirit. Note these two points for they are of real
significance. The conflict which produces these stages in consciousness is
fostered by the indirect influence of the planet Mars. Mars carries the war
into the very depth of circumstance, environment and being, and confers at
the same time such devotion to the visioned objective—as seen at any
particular point upon the path—that final failure is rendered impossible. Towards the end of the evolutionary process, the disciple begins to respond
consciously to the fourth indirect influence—that of Pluto, producing the
death of the hindering factors and of all that prevents synthesis. Pluto, as it
affects Gemini, brings about the death or the finish of the separative,
instinctual nature, for this is the factor which lies behind all dualism; it is
inherent in what The Secret Doctrine calls the principle of ahankara or the
awareness of the [366] separative, isolated ego; it is inimical for aeons to
the aspiration of the imprisoned soul, focussed within or identified with
some aspect of the personality, and, in a later stage, with the personality
itself.
In this analysis of the various signs I have not given much time to the
consideration of the effect of the zodiacal signs upon the physical body. This
is a science in itself and is closely tied up with the entire theory of spiritual
healing. I would like, however, to touch upon the relation of Gemini to the
physical form, for it is so truly symbolic of the processes of divine
unfoldment and therefore most timely.
Gemini rules the arms and the hands, indicating the service which the two
brothers must render to each other in producing the dissolution (under
Pluto) of the separative relation which exists for so long between them. It is
the health unto life that is here to be considered, and for this reason Gemini
governs also the oxygenation of the blood, leading as a result to life activity
and to the free interplay and circulation of the spirit-soul aspect throughout
all the complex organisms within the corporate form. Where there is the free
flow of the life force and no impediment to the circulation of the life fluid,
via the blood, there will consequently and normally be the presence of
perfect health. It is the understanding of this law which produces in the
initiate the condition of controlled health and chosen immortality which is
the stated objective of many schools of mental healing. These are as you
know (without exception), so purely mystical and unscientific that their
achievements are practically nil. They uphold the ideal but fail of the
consummation. Gemini also governs the nervous system and the fluid reactions of the entire
nervous organism. Hence you have, in this sign and its activity, the tendency
to the eventual control [367] of the two aspects of the soul to which I have
made such constant reference in my books: the life aspect seated in the heart
and using the blood stream as its mode of interplay and of life-giving
expression, and the consciousness aspect, seated in the head and using the
nervous system as its mode or condition or process of expression. To these
must be added both the direct and the indirect effect of the rays which rule
the sign. It is through the understanding of life and consciousness, as
governed by Gemini, that the final release can be mentally achieved. Ponder
upon this statement, for in Gemini, the disciple can come to some intelligent
grasp of what we might call the consciousness-mechanism and of the life
processes which enable man finally to be what he is. Gemini also rules the
thymus gland which is inactive at present in the adult person, owing to the
fact that the heart centre is unawakened in the majority. It will, however,
become active when “the immortal brother floods the mortal brother with
the light and life of God.” Then the heart centre, with its correlating activity
of consciousness (group understanding and group love) will function freely.
The mystery of the sign is in reality concerned with the secret of the
response which should and eventually will exist between the two brothers,
between the two poles—soul and form—and between the mortal self or
personality and the immortal self or soul. Sensitivity and quick reaction are
characteristic of people born with the Sun in this sign or with Gemini rising.
This leads in the earlier stages and with the undeveloped person to a fluid
versatility; in the later and more advanced stages it leads to an equally fluid
but analytical understanding of men and of circumstances. This is brought
about through the constant activity, the ceaseless movement and the
unending changing conditions which are inherent in the sign itself; these
“pulsate between [368] the two aspects” of this dual sign, and are enhanced
by the fact that Gemini is the most important aspect of the Mutable Cross,
setting or determining the changes and their rate of progression.
In the polar opposite of this sign, Sagittarius, the interplay between the two
brothers or between the lower and the higher selves, is focussed or conditioned into one united and directed effort. The versatile changeable
man becomes the self-directed disciple, one-pointed in effort, yet preserving
all the versatility earlier developed but controlling and governing the
tendency to fluidity, to lost motion and to misdirected change. I dealt with
much of this when we were studying the sign Sagittarius, and it is, therefore,
unnecessary to repeat it here.
It is of great interest to the initiate or to the advanced disciple to realise that
in this sign no planet either falls or is exalted. The clue to this mystery lies
hid in the fact that, in the intermediate stage between Gemini and
Sagittarius, equilibrium, balance, fusion and blending are the objectives of
the struggling and almost blinded conscious entity. He must achieve
harmony with a consequent avoidance of all extremes. The seven signs—
inclusive of Gemini and Sagittarius—are of extreme importance where
humanity is concerned:
Gemini .— Subjective in nature. Vital. Is not focussed upon the physical
plane. Is focussed upon the mortal brother.
Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio — Are strictly human signs with their
recognition of duality, emphasised in the central sign Virgo.
Sagittarius. — Subjective in nature. Vital. Is not focussed in
consciousness upon the physical plane. Is focussed upon the immortal
brother.
[369] In Sagittarius the same condition is found. No planet is exalted and no
planet falls. Mercury is, however, in detriment or its influence is lessened. In
Gemini, the above is true of Jupiter. Why this is so, is, esoterically speaking,
one of the secrets of initiation. The clue to the mystery lies in the basic,
spiritual dualism of Jupiter in contradistinction to the body-soul dualism of
Gemini; in Sagittarius, the dualism of Mercury as it expresses itself in the
lower-higher mind is transcended by the universal or spiritual mind. More
than this hint is not at this time possible.
In connection with the decanates and their rulers, it is interesting to find that
Sepharial and Alan Leo give entirely different ruling planets, and yet both are right. Uniquely for him, Sepharial gives the three planets of Jupiter,
Mars and the Sun, and thus indicates those which are the esoteric rulers of
the sign upon the wheel of discipleship. Usually his choice is exoteric and
not esoteric. Leo, in this case, gives Mercury, Venus and Saturn, and these
three govern the wheel of ordinary life. Between them, they cover the wheel
as it turns in both directions. You will note how two out of the governing
planets of the decanates in the case of the ordinary wheel serve to enhance
the planetary rulers of the sign, Gemini with Saturn offering at a certain
fairly advanced stage the opposition needed to bring about a basic
revolution. Note this phrasing. The entire question of the revolving wheel
with its dual action and its dual effect upon consciousness (and therefore the
whole problem of the three decans and their rulers in each sign of the
zodiac) must remain a difficult and abstruse problem until [370] such time
as astrologers have developed a four-dimensional consciousness and know
the true meaning of the Biblical phrase: the “wheel turning upon itself.” In
reality, the wheel does not turn like a wheel in a car either forward or the
reverse. It turns every way and both ways simultaneously. This fact is, as
yet, an impossible one for the human consciousness to grasp. The
complexity involved in the progress through the decans—conditioning also
the rulers—is to be found to be based upon this multiple action of the wheel.
The wheel, therefore, moves not only clockwise, but both ways at once and
also at right angles to itself.
The obviousness of the meaning of the two Words for this sign requires
from me no elucidation. For the ordinary man the Word goes forth “Let
instability do its work” but for the disciple the Word is uttered by the soul
itself: “I recognise my other self and in the waning of that self, I grow and
glow.”
Fluidity, recognition of duality, soul control! These are the keynotes of this
sign, and should be the keynote of your life, for whether you are in this sign
in this life, it has at some time and many times conditioned your experience,
and the results are marked in the life of the advanced disciple. TAURUS, THE BULL
We now arrive at the last of the twelve signs which we have been
considering and the last of those which affect humanity. It is also the second
sign which—after the reorientation preceding discipleship—produces
changes and opportunity for the disciple. We come also to the sign which is
called “the sign of the major life incentive,” because Taurus is the symbol of
desire in all its phases. Whether the subjective man is impelled by desire, or
the disciple is driven forth upon the path of return by the urge of aspiration,
[371] or whether the initiate is controlled by the will to cooperate with the
Plan, he is, nevertheless, being responsive to the most potent manifestation
of a little known and understood aspect of divinity, to which we give the
inadequate name of the Will of God.
Will, power, desire, aspiration, ambition, motive, purpose, impulse,
incentive, plan—all these are words which attempt to express one of the
major underlying attributes and fundamental causes (man scarcely knows
which) of manifestation, of the evolutionary processes and of the will-to-be
or the will-to-live. The great triplicity of desire—aspiration—direction
(will) are only three words which endeavour to describe the progress and
bias of man the personality, man the soul, and man the channel for spirit or
life. All three point inadequately to the cause of the threefold expression
which underlies all events, all progress and all happenings in time and
space.
It was the Buddha who clarified for man the nature of desire and its results,
with the unhappy effects which desire produces when persistent and
unenlightened. It was the Christ Who taught the transmutation of desire into
aspiration which, from the expression given to it in The New Testament ,
was the effort of the human will (hitherto animated by, or expressed
through, desire) to conform itself to the will of God—this without
understanding but conformity, in perfect trust and with the inner assurance
that the will of God must be all that is good, both in the individual and in the
whole. Now, as the Shamballa force is beginning to pour into the world, man is
seeking another interpretation of God's will which will not involve the
hitherto blind acquiescence and unavoidable acceptance of the inscrutable
dictates of a potent, inescapable Providence, but which will produce an
[372] understanding cooperation with the divine Plan and an enlightened
fusion of the individual will with the great, divine will and this for the
greater good of the whole. For this desirable attitude there is worldwide
preparation going forward in a simple and unobtrusive manner through the
gradual fomentation of the will-to-good everywhere and the demand, so
universally voiced, that human conditions may be more truly enlightened,
more acutely polarised for the benefit of the whole and more definitely
subordinated to the innate divine urge for beauty, synthesis and the free
expression of the hidden mystery which is to be found at the heart of all
forms. It is going forward also through the constant attempt to comprehend
and interpret the Plan for humanity, as its broad outlines begin to become
apparent to the developing intelligence of man.
This all indicates a growing responsiveness on man's part to the incoming
Shamballa influences and the consequent evocation of the will aspect of
man's nature. This must produce undesirable as well as desirable results on
account of man's present point of evolution and is, therefore, responsible for
much that is taking place in the world today. The trembling response of
humanity (through the medium of the most enlightened and sensitive people
in each country) to this influence and the corresponding magnetic interplay
between the great centre at Shamballa and the human centre is a steadily
growing fact, registered and noted by the watching Hierarchy and making
certain major changes inevitable and unavoidable. This augurs well for the
future in spite of temporary misuse of the forces. Necessarily and
simultaneously, this interplay evokes response from the unprepared and the
unready and from the wrongly oriented and the selfishly polarised person.
This stimulates the will-to-power in the individual and fosters personality
integration [373] of the wrong kind and its enforced desires. Thus, through
these personalities and their wrong emphasis and teachings, nations also are
misled—again temporarily—and the Shamballa force is wrongly employed and directed. The result of this dual effect of the Shamballa force at the
present time is the precipitation of that cleansing but terrible process which
we call War. This war is the consummation of the conflict between the pairs
of opposites and the basic duality of manifestation and is not motivated
basically as have been all previous wars. When I refer to this conflict I
would remind you that to us (the workers on the inner side) the 1914
conflict and this one are two phases of one condition.
The war, when held in a steady focus by the Guides of the race and when
not permitted to pursue too long and too terrible a course, can most
definitely further the ends of evolution by creating situations which foster
mental development under spiritual guidance, necessitating clear thought (a
thing rare to find), the removal of undesirable conditions by their emergence
into prominence and by the consequent removal of their originating sources
and also by the definite effects produced upon the emotional body of
humanity by corporate suffering and pain. This suffering, deprivation,
anxiety and distress can lead to a reversal of human orientation upon the
wheel of life, just as it does in the case of the individual aspirant. It can lead
to the focussing of all the life tendencies upon a world of truer values and
reality and thus inaugurate the new and better civilisation for which we all
hope. Looking at the world today if you could but see it as we the teachers
on the inner side can see it, you would become aware of such a re-focussing
and re-orienting on all sides.
Again, however, the time element comes in (that brain-conditioned sense of
awareness) and the problem with which [374] the Hierarchy is now
concerned is to see that the present conflict does not persist unduly long , to
awaken all the nations, without exception, to a sense of the dramatic import
of the present time and of their right share and their responsibility and thus
to engineer a climax wherein the correct world lesson may be learnt;
whereby the world may be purified by the elimination of the undesirable
elements which hinder the new era and the upspringing of a more spiritual
civilisation; and whereby the forces of hate, of cruelty, of materialism and of darkness may be driven back (wherever found) before the sweeping
onslaught of the Forces of Light.
It might be here pointed out that just as the Aquarian Age is coming into
manifestation for our planet as a whole, bringing in its wake universal
awareness and the new modes of expressing world synthesis, human
interests and the world religion, so humanity, the world disciple, is
beginning to come under the influence of Taurus. It is this influence which
will bring about at this time the reversal of the wheel of life for those in the
human family who are ready (and their numbers are now very great). This is
happening and the results are inevitable and cannot be evaded. The great
question is: Will this Taurian influence, increased as it is by the incoming
Shamballa forces, produce the floodlight of illumination of which Taurus is
the custodian, or will it simply foment desire, increase selfishness and bring
humanity to the “fiery heights of self-interest” instead of to the mountain of
vision and initiation?
This is the situation which confronts the Knowers of the race in their
various grades of knowledge and illumination at this time. Neither of these
influences—the Taurian or the Aquarian—can be avoided. As you will see
when we study the analysis of this sign and come to a consideration of its
rulers, Taurus forges the instruments of constructive living
[375] or of destruction; it forges the chains which bind or creates the key
which unlocks the mystery of life; it is this forging process, with its
consequent clamour, which is going on at this time in a most potent manner.
Vulcan controls the anvil-like processes of time and strikes the blow which
shapes the metal into that which is desired, and this is true today as never
before.
He it is who is forging the way for the coming Avatar Who will—at the
right moment—come forth, embodying in Himself the Will of God which is
the divine will-to-good, to peace through understanding, and to right
relations between men and between nations. The Taurian influence must now be regarded as being of exceeding potency
today, particularly from the angle of the subjective spiritual values; it is
Taurus which is the ruler and the guiding influence of that which is
occurring everywhere.
I would like here to call your attention to the fact that this sign is a synthetic
sign in the sense that it brings expression of an inner urge of some definite
nature upon the physical plane. This it does, because its basic quality
demonstrates as desire in the mass of men and as will or directed purpose in
the disciple or the initiate. It manifests as stubbornness in the average man
(and this is literally wilful adherence to personality aims) or as intelligently
expressed will—actuated by the impulse of love—in the advanced man.
This connotes adherence to soul purpose. People who are Taurians naturally
and by natal inclination would do well to consider this statement and thus
test all their major determining activities by the question: Is my present
attitude, my work or intention actuated by personality desire or am I
working and planning directly under soul urge and incentive? This should
give the keynote of all Taurian [376] problems. The entire secret of divine
purpose and planning is hidden in this sign, owing fundamentally to the
relation of the Pleiades to the constellation, the Great Bear, and to our solar
system. This constitutes one of the most important triangles in our entire
cosmic series of relationships and this importance is also enhanced by the
fact that the “eye of the Bull” is the eye of revelation. The underlying goal
of the evolutionary process—“the onward rush of the Bull of God,” as it is
esoterically called—reveals steadily and without cessation the stupendous
and sublime plan of Deity. This is the subject which light reveals.
There is at this time, owing to the influx of the Shamballa force, the
establishing of a peculiar relation or alignment between the constellation,
Taurus (with its own specific alignment with the Pleiades and Great Bear)
the planet, Pluto, and our Earth. This produces much of the present world
difficulty and one which the modern astrologer would do well to consider. It
constitutes a major cosmic triangle at this time, conditioning much that is
now happening. This Shamballa force is that which “fans or intensifies the light by the
removal of obstructions and proceeds from far distant places, pouring
through the eye of illumination into those spheres of influence upon the
sorrowful planet, the Earth, impelling the Bull upon its onward rush.” So
speaks the Old Commentary . The import of this is that the energy of will—
newly released by Sanat Kumara upon our planet—emanates, via the head
centre of the planetary Logos, from the Great Bear; it is stepped down in
vibration via one of the Pleiades (hence its influence upon matter and hence
also its pronounced Taurian effects upon humanity) and so enters into the
solar system. It is there absorbed by that major centre of our planetary life to
which we give the name, Shamballa. Its effect is necessarily twofold. It
produces in [377] certain nations, races and individuals, a welling up of the
self-will or of the will-to-power which is characteristic of the developed
lower nature, the personality aspect of integrated selfhood. It produces—
though less readily—a stimulation of the will-to-serve the plan as it is
grasped by the world aspirants, the world disciples and initiates. Thus are
the purposes of Deity materialised.
Owing to the world glamour, the true purpose and ideal set before our
planetary forces by the all-creating Will becomes distorted by many people.
They are not polarised in the divine will but are as yet centred in their
personalities and hence only the few appreciate the beauty of the intended
group life, group purpose and group fusion. Group living tends to the
fulfilment of free will in service and a free subordination of the lower will to
the higher purpose in group formation. Through the glamour contacted,
however, this group activity and life becomes twisted into the imposed will
and the concept of the super-state. This produces the imprisonment of the
mind and the curtailment of all freedom, all free thought and free will. The
man becomes the captive of the man-made state. This gives a clue to much
that is happening today and to the headstrong progress of the glamoured
peoples, to the stiffening of individuals in their separative, wrong idealisms
and to their acceptance of the imposition of a rule of life and an order of
living which is imposed upon them by force and which is not the free
expression of a free people. The same force, secondly, brings to other peoples and individuals a measure
of illumination—an illumination which reveals the underlying synthesis,
which indicates the dualism which must finally vanish and which indicates
also the secret of right human relations. One reaction produces the onward
rush of the materialistic systems of life, thought and desire, [378] dashing
blindly forward in the force of their own momentum and producing a stage
of powerful expression and active movement; the other demonstrates in a far
vision of possibility and a steady movement forward in spite of the
immediate dangers and difficulties.
The Bull, therefore, in expression is dual. Today we see the wilful dash of
the lower nature of humanity, embodied in the forces of aggression, and the
purposeful progress of those people and peoples who seek, even if without
full understanding, to work out the plans of God, proceeding in spite of each
other. That is as far as the evolutionary processes have yet taken humanity
and hence the critical situation now to be found. The question is: Will the
Bull of desire or the Bull of divine illumined expression succeed?
This sign is an earth sign and hence the working out of the Plan or the
fulfilment of desire must be carried out upon the outer plane of living. This
will or desire must express itself in the plane of outer living and in the
environment whether it is the environment of an individual man, of a nation
or of a group of nations.
As you know, astrologers have long pointed out that this sign concerns the
physical body among other factors, and the health or wholeness of the body
is closely connected with the expression of past desire or of present idealism
and this is a point to be borne in mind. Today, the cure or care of the
physical body is of paramount importance to practically everybody and the
thoughts of all peoples without exception, whether at war or not, are turned
that way. The emphasis upon the wholeness of the individual physical life is
symbolic of the outer body of humanity, viewing all human beings as a unit.
Again, gold is the symbol which today governs man's desires whether
national, economic or religious; it is connected [379] with this sign and this is one of the indications that today the conflict in the world economic
situation is based upon the upwelling of desire. In an esoteric way, therefore
—quoting from a very ancient book of prophecy:
“The golden eye of Taurus points the way to those who likewise see.
That which is gold will some day, too, respond, passing from East to
West in that dire time when the urge to gather gold shall rule the
lower half (i.e., the personality aspect of men and of nations—
A.A.B.). The search for gold, the search for golden light divine,
directs the Bull of Life, the Bull of Form. These two must meet; and
meeting, clash. Thus vanishes the gold....”
The earthly triplicity of Capricorn, Virgo and Taurus form a triangle of
material expression which is of profound interest as one studies it either
from the angle of the ordinary round of the zodiac, followed by average and
undeveloped humanity, or from the angle of the disciple wherein the path of
zodiacal progress is reversed.
In the first case, Capricorn marks the point of greatest density and concrete
expression and shows the life divine as deeply imbedded in substance. This
is the true state of death as far as the life is concerned; it is captivity in form.
In Virgo, however, that life makes its inner pressure felt and the movement
—faint yet real—of the hidden life begins to pulsate within the concrete
form, producing in Taurus that reaction to desire and that onward rush and
powerful movement which distinguishes the evolutionary progress of the
individual, working under the impulse of desire. Forget not, that the first
thrill or response of the Christ life is to the pull, urge or suggestion of the
form nature wherein it finds [380] itself. Then later, when all the resources
of the form nature (drawn out through desire), are exhausted and the Christ
life is exceedingly strong and ready to reveal itself through the death of the
Mother, the form, then and not till then is the progress of the wheel arrested
and “revolution” takes place with the life aspect reversing itself upon the
wheel. Then the disciple (an expression of the Christ life in its early
manifested stages), having transmuted desire into aspiration, begins his
career—objectively and in full consciousness—in the sign Taurus and “on the wings of aspiration” proceeds towards Virgo and “being both the Mother
and the Child enters into the House of Labour.” From that house, the
disciple in due time arrives at Capricorn where he finally subdues matter,
form or concrete expression to divine uses and purposes, and thus
demonstrates the triumph and the potency of the Christ life.
The secret of the Triangles or triplicities in their fourfold expression is as
yet an unexplored aspect of astrological research and one with which we
will later concern ourselves.
This sign Taurus is, therefore, the eleventh sign upon the ordinary wheel of
exoteric emphasis and life, preceding each new cycle of incarnated
expression. As the individual descends into incarnation and when he takes
an astral shell, he definitely comes into a Taurian cycle, for it is desire
which impels to rebirth and it takes the potency of Taurus to bring this
about. As this subject concerns the astrology of the astral vehicle we will
not deal with it further for that is a phase of research for which humanity is
not yet ready.
This sign is also the second subjective sign on the reversed wheel,
preparatory to the conscious recognition of the right relation of the dualities
in Gemini. Ponder on this. In this sign we have consequently the following
qualities or aspects in juxtaposition: [381]
1. Desire—leading to aspiration upon the reversed wheel.
2. Blindness—leading eventually to sight.
3. Darkness—leading finally to light. Júpiter . Death—leading at last to liberation.
In the last analysis, we come back to the eternal dualities, leading as they
ever do to the interplay of the polar opposites, to the cyclic ebb and flow of
the inner life and the outer periphery of expression, and to that attraction
and repulsion which leads to a steady shift of the attracting force to an ever
higher and wider appeal. It is the secret of eventual synthesis, which is the
final illumination, seen through the eye of Taurus. It is for this reason that
this sign is regarded as being one of universal movement, of great and constant activity under the impulse of material desire or the urge of the
divine will, when recognised and sensed. The triangle of expression is one
of potent energies:
1. Desire . . . . . . . . . . . .
2. Man . . . . . . . . . . . . .
3. Materiality . . . . . . . . Júpiter . Form . . . . . . . . . . . .

Shamballa. I ring these changes constantly as the consideration of them, intelligently
grasped, will lead eventually and inevitably to their fusion in your
individual consciousness.
It is not my intention to say much here anent the Fixed Cross of which
Taurus is one of the arms. I dealt with this in several places when
considering with you the constellations Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. I would,
therefore, refer you to my earlier comments. Scorpio is, as you will have
realised, the dominant arm through which the most effective potency flows
upon the reversed wheel, where advanced humanity is concerned because it
is the testing sign for humanity and [382] the one in which the human being
reaches the depths or attains the heights. Taurus is the dominant stream of
energy upon this Fixed Cross where average man is concerned. The energy
let loose through this Cross is stupendous in its effects, producing finally the
great reversal and renunciation. In this Cross, Taurus is the Initiator for it
“impulses the Will,” producing movement and momentum. You have (if I
may repeat earlier implications) the following conditions and
correspondences in connection with the three Crosses:
1. The Cardinal Cross . . .
2. The Fixed Cross . . . . .
3. The Mutable Cross . . . Spirit . . . .
Soul . . . . .
Form . . . . Will . . . . . . . . . . .
Consciousness . . .
Activity . . . . . . . . Shamballa.
Hierarchy.
Humanity. The initiate is one who is in process of relating consciously and effectively
all these three within himself. Man the essential triangle of energy, man the
square, man upon the Cross, and finally, man the five-pointed star! In these
four simple symbolic forms lies the whole history of the fourth kingdom in nature. The triangle and the star are subjective expressions of a fixed
consciousness, focussed in reality, whilst the square and the Cross are
objective expressions of the man focussed outwardly.
We come now to a brief study of the Rulers of this sign. As Taurus is so
close, esoterically speaking, to the sign Aries which—in this world cycle—
is the sign of beginning, it constitutes, relatively speaking, a very complex
aggregation of forces, being related not only to Aries with its cosmic
contacts, but also to the Pleiades and the Great Bear. Yet at the same time, it
is very simple in its expression for it is governed by only two planets. Venus
is its exoteric ruler and Vulcan its esoteric and hierarchical ruler. We touch
upon one of the mysteries of the Ageless Wisdom. Venus [383] holds a
unique relation to the Earth, different to that of any other planet and this,
therefore, brings about a much closer relation between Taurus and the Earth
than perhaps exists in any other zodiacal relation where our planet is
concerned. In saying this, I mean in this particular world cycle and at the
peculiar stage of evolutionary unfoldment at which mankind now finds
itself. All is in a state of flux and change; as man unfolds his consciousness,
other constellations may come into pronounced activity in conjunction with
the controlling sign and still others may become more remote in their
contact and effect. Today, however, Taurus, Venus and the Earth have a very
close karmic relation and a very definite dharma to work out together . Just
what that karma and relationship may prove eventually to be lies beyond
ordinary human understanding but some idea of it may be gained by relating
in your mind the words: Will, Desire, Light and Plan. In voicing it thus, I
but step down and distort the relation, but until men can think in simple
symbols and without words and can interpret these hitherto unrecognised
symbols correctly, more it is not possible to add.
To understand the relation of Venus and the Earth, I would have you ponder
on what I earlier gave in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire .
The entire relationship has been summed up in the words: The planet Venus
is to the planet Earth what the higher Self is to the Personality. Remember
that the planet Venus is one of the seven sacred planets whereas the Earth is not. This statement involves, as you can see, a deep mystery of relativity, of
interplay and of eventual revelation. This revelation as to the relation of the
Earth's alter ego to the world of human life will only be revealed at the third
initiation, at which time all glamour and illusion is dissipated [384] and “the
light which shines through the eye of the Bull will be unimpeded” and carry
light into the darkness.
Venus connotes in our minds, even if we have only a glimmer of occult
truth, that which is mental, that which concerns final sublimation, that
which deals with sex and that which must work out into symbolic
expression upon the physical plane. These are the major concepts which
enter our minds when Venus and Taurus are considered in unison. These
factors of expression have ever been related to these two since the night of
time, because they are essentially basic and eternally cosmic in their
implications. Taurus is one of the signs which veils a certain divine mystery.
For the sake of disciples in training, these four concepts have been briefly
summed up in an archaic writing of great significance. This writing states:
“The holy Sons of Mind embraced the two. They saw and understood.
Thus was sex born and thus the great mistake was made. The mind
was outward turned. The form appears to view and not the life.
“Out of the dark, they cried aloud, the holy Sons of Mind. In pain, they
cried aloud. They inward looked and knew the error they had made
but knew not what to do.... The Lord replied and gave to them the
sign of resurrection.”
Do you grasp the significance of this statement, and its fundamental
simplicity? Let me give you a hint. The earthy triplicity has been designated
by astrologers as embodying the idea of plains (Taurus), of caves (Virgo)
and of rock (Capricorn). It might be stated that these caves exist in the
rocks, deep under the plains. I am speaking figuratively and symbolically.
Out of the rocky cave, the Christ emerged [385] and walked again upon the
plains of Earth and from that time “the woman knew Him not.” Form had
no further hold upon him for He had overcome it in the depths. Into the cave
of Initiation, the light of resurrection streams when the stone at the entrance is rolled away. From life in the form to the death of the form—deep in the
rocky place, down in the crypts of the Temple—the human being goes. But
into that same place, the new life streams, bringing fresh life and liberation;
old things pass away and the darkness becomes light.
Sex is then seen to be in truth only the relation of the lower nature to the
higher Self; it is then lifted up into the light of day in order that man may
reach complete union with divinity. Man discovers that sex (which has
hitherto been a purely physical function, carried on sometimes under the
impulse of love) is elevated into its rightful plane as the divine marriage,
carried out and consummated upon the levels of soul awareness. It is this
great truth which lies beyond the sordid story of sex expression, of sex
magic and the distortions of modern Tantric magic. Humanity has stepped
down the symbolism and in its thoughts debased sex to an animal function
and failed to lift it up into the realm of symbolic mystery. Men have sought
through physical expression to produce the inner fusion and harmony which
they crave and this cannot be done. Sex is but the symbol of an inner duality
which must be itself transcended and wrought into a unity. It is not
transcended by physical means or rituals. It is a transcendence in
consciousness.
The esoteric ruler of Taurus is Vulcan, the forger of metals, the one who
works in the densest, most concrete expression of the natural world (from
the human angle). He is the one who goes down into the depths to find the
material upon which to expend his innate art and to fashion [386] that
which is beautiful and useful. Vulcan is, therefore, that which stands for the
soul, the individual, inner, spiritual man; in his activity we find the key to
the soul's task upon the eternal round of the wheel of life. You will
remember how Hercules upon the Fixed Cross had to fashion his own
weapons before he succeeded in the struggle. This is in reality a reference to
the art of Vulcan who rules the inner man and guides his fashioning.
Vulcan also rules nations at a certain stage of embryonic soul expression,
such as the present, and governs their activities, fashioning the instruments
of war when war and conflict are the only means whereby liberation can come, though woe betide those through whom wars come. Vulcan then takes
hold and—since the Middle Ages—has brought the mineral kingdom, “the
depths from which supply must come,” under human control. In the present
war, Vulcan is concerned along with Venus in the relation of man to man,
and of man to the mineral kingdom. Venus, the mental energy of humanity,
establishes relation between man and man, between nation and nation whilst
Vulcan establishes relation between the fourth kingdom in nature and the
first. Vulcan, as we shall see later, is governed by the first ray, and the first
ray and the first kingdom are definitely bound together. This, therefore,
brings in the Shamballa force and you consequently have an esoteric
triangle of energy—will, humanity and the mineral kingdom. They have a
very close rapport with each other, both from the angle of the Plan and from
the expression of material selfishness. Hence the great use of minerals (iron,
copper, etc.) in the World War Gêmeos . It is literally a war in which the mineral
kingdom is used against the human. Humanity had gone down into the
caves and the depths of concretion and is ready now for an upward shift or
move, this time consciously taken [387] and taken all together. This is a
most difficult situation for the average man to comprehend but the entire
problem of the conscious use of that which exists upon the planet and also
its destructive usage is tied together into one most critical situation. Part of
the solution will come along similar lines and of this the prophecy now
coming into the racial awareness that there are those “who sleep in the caves
of the earth who will arise and bring liberation” has reference. But be not
too literal in interpretation for “that which is of the earth can also be found
in the sky.”
Hierarchically also the ruler is Vulcan, conditioning the planet and
determining the fact that man is the macrocosm of the microcosm and that
the fourth kingdom fashions or conditions all subhuman kingdoms.
It is the subjectivity of this sign which makes the understanding of it so
difficult. It will not be until humanity has grasped the nature of the will that
the true significance of the Taurian influence will be grasped. Both the sign,
Aries, and the sign, Taurus, are concerned with the initial impact of energy upon form or of energies upon the soul. Man today is becoming slowly
aware of the distinction to be found between the opposites and is grasping
vaguely the true nature of desire. But he is still in the vale of illusion and—
whilst there—cannot see with clarity. One of the first opposites which the
disciple has to grasp is that of the subjective and the objective worlds.
Three signs are also closely connected with initiation. The hidden secret
of Aries, Taurus and Gemini is revealed at three successive initiations:
1. The secret of Aries is the secret of beginnings, of cycles and of
emerging opportunity. At the third initiation, the initiate begins to
understand the life of the spirit or the [388] highest aspect; until that
time, he has expressed first the life of the form and then the life of the
soul within that form. This experience is of so high a nature that only
those who have passed through it could in any way comprehend
anything I might say.
2. The secret of Taurus is revealed at the second initiation by the sudden
removal or disappearance of world glamour in the blinding energy of
light. This constitutes the final radiant activity which consummates
the play of the Taurian force upon humanity during the long and
cyclic journey to which man is committed. The individual enacts on a
tiny scale what humanity—as a whole—will enact when it takes
initiation in Taurus.
3. The secret of Gemini has to be grasped at the first initiation because it
is the mystery of the relation of Father, Mother and Child. The birth
of the Christ-child upon the physical plane is the consummating glory
of the Gemini force.
All this concerns the subjective energies which express themselves through
the medium of the personality or form aspect. When, therefore, I speak of
subjective energies, I refer to the forces pouring from the soul (on soul
levels) into the form nature upon its own level of awareness. I could
illustrate this by pointing out that desire is not (from the angle of reality) a
subjective quality except in so far as it is a distortion or a glamorous use of
the energy of will. Desire is the force of the form nature; will is the energy of the soul expressing itself as direction, progress, and conformity to the
Plan. This Plan, from the standpoint of the individual, is as much of the
sensed will of God as he can, at any particular stage in his experience, grasp
and understand. These distinctions also merit consideration. The [389]
average human being may consider desire as subjective because he is so
completely identified with form life upon the outer planes that the impulses
and incentives coming to him along the stream of consciousness are viewed
by him as intangible and mystical. Yet they are in reality but form radiations
and reactions and are not truly and technically subjective at all. The high
call of duty, the sense of responsibility are truly subjective in nature for they
come from the soul and are the response of the soul to the pull of the form.
Gradually, the disciple learns to distinguish between these distinctive
aspects of energy and force which impinge ceaselessly upon his
consciousness. As time goes on, his analysis becomes ever more acute and
more discriminating until he knows finally which is an expression of force
(coming from the form) and which are energy contacts (coming from the
soul).
This digression was necessary at this point because it is essential that
esoteric astrologers should realise that these three signs, Aries, Taurus and
Gemini are (from the standpoint of the disciple and initiate) purely
subjective in their effects within the life of these signs. They can only find
outward expression in the life of the subject and be consciously directed and
controlled in Cancer, thus leading to the great liberation which takes place
in the polar opposite to Cancer, Capricorn and also in Aquarius and Pisces.
This of course refers to effects upon man upon the reversed wheel. In a
certain sense these six signs constitute two major triangles of force.
I have here indicated to you the higher or spiritual aspect of King Solomon's
seal. When these six types of energy are fused and blended and so form one
unity, you will then find emerging the “Star of Christ.” This is one of the
symbols of the sixth initiation and is the inner correspondence [390] of the
star with which you are familiar. In order to understand this more clearly I
would point out to you that: 1. That which is begun or “entered into” at the first initiation is
consummated and completed in Pisces.
2. That which impelled to the processes of involution and evolution (the
desire to incarnate) takes form at the second initiation in the will-toliberation in Taurus and finds itself released through the will-to-serve
—universally—in Aquarius.
3. That which is fluid and changeable in Gemini produces the great shift
in consciousness which distinguishes the initiate from the disciple.
This, at the third initiation becomes a fixed attitude in Capricorn. The
concrete form life is transcended and the inner man reorients and
assumes an unchangeable direction. You might here ask why I deal here with these abstractions? I would reply,
that in your effort to understand and to grasp the truth which lies beyond
your reason (even when regarding it as a hypothesis hereto unproven) you
are gradually developing an aspect of your mind which is much needed in
the processes of realisation, and which must be called into effective service
during initiation. Such an effort [391] is needed if true understanding is to
occur; initiation is the demonstration of intuitive understanding put to
practical expression.
As we resume our initial theme, I would call your attention to the fact that
through the exoteric or orthodox planet, Venus, this sign Taurus is related to
Gemini, Libra and Capricorn. It is of interest to note that Taurus is,
therefore, related to the Mutable Cross by a linking stream of energy, via
Venus, but is at the same time linked in a dual sense with two arms of the Cardinal Cross, by a Venusian connection with Libra and Capricorn. There
is therefore to the true Taurian who reaches illumination one link with the
body and soul aspects of expression and two links with soul and spirit—the
higher octave of manifestation. Thus is shown the perfection of the
sublimation process, for aspiration has entirely superseded desire as a
motivating agency. The soul is linked with form but its major link is with
the spirit. It is for this reason that in Taurus, the man comes to the point
wherein the real goal or the true vision appears. Desire in its lowest
expression is linked with the form in Taurus. Aspirational idealism in its
highest possible expression is also achieved in Taurus. Aspiration is linked,
however, in its lowest expression with the soul and in its highest with spirit.
Self-will relates man to form; the will of God relates the soul of the man to
the spirit. It takes three initiations to make this clear to the disciple.
Looking at the matter from another angle: Venus, the mind or the soul in
Libra reveals to man the exoteric significance and results of desire. In
Gemini, Venus reveals the desire of the pairs of opposites for each other for
this is the underlying theme of the entire creative and evolutionary process
—the interplay of the opposites. In Capricorn, Venus reveals to man that
desire for the whole, for the universal, [392] which is the hallmark of the
initiate and the true expression of the spiritual life.
When we come to a consideration of the esoteric ruler of Taurus, we find
ourselves confronted by Vulcan, one of the veiled and hidden planets and
one which is, therefore, little known or understood. I have earlier referred to
Vulcan as the Fashioner of divine expression. In a peculiar sense, the energy
which streams from Vulcan is fundamentally the strength and potency
which sets the world evolutionary process in motion; it embodies also the
energy of the first ray, that force which initiates or begins and that which
also destroys, bringing about the death of the form in order that the soul
may be set free.
Vulcan is the ray or planet of isolation for, in a peculiar sense, it governs the
fourth initiation wherein the depths of aloneness are plumbed and the man
stands completely isolated. He stands detached from “that which is above and this which is below.” There comes a dramatic moment when all desire is
renounced; the will of God or the Plan is seen as the only desirable objective
but as yet the man has not proved to himself, to the world of men or to his
Master whether he has the strength to move forward along the line of
service. There is revealed to him (as there was revealed to the Christ at the
fourth great initiatory crisis in His life) some definite, active undertaking
which embodies that aspect of the will of God which it is his peculiar
function to appropriate and make possible of expression. This has been
called in the Christian phraseology, “the Gethsemane experience.” The
Christ, kneeling beside the rock (symbolic of the depths of the mineral
kingdom and of the activity of Vulcan, the fashioner), raises His eyes
upward to where the light of revelation breaks forth and knows at [393] that
moment what it is He has to do. Such is the test of Vulcan, ruling Taurus, of
the soul, ruling desire, of the Son of God, fashioning His instrument of
expression in the depths, grasping the divine purpose and so bending the
will of the little self to that of the greater Self. The depths have been reached
and there is no more to be done. The light from the eye of the Bull which
with ever increasing radiance has guided the struggling soul must give place
eventually to the light of the Sun, for Vulcan is a substitute for the Sun; it is
spoken of sometimes as being veiled by the Sun and at others it stands for
the Sun itself. It stands between the man and the Sun, the soul. Therefore,
we have in this connection three symbols of the light:
1. Taurus.—The eye of illumination or light. The Bull's eye.
Illumination. Exoterically—the physical Sun.
2. Vulcan.—The one who reveals that which is deeply hidden and brings
it up into the light. Esoterically—the heart of the Sun.
3. The Sun.—The great Illuminator. Spiritually—the central spiritual
Sun.
Thus from every angle, illumination remains the theme of this sign.
We have somewhat considered the rays and their effect and relationship as
they, through Taurus and its rulers, pour their force and energy into
individual man, or into humanity as a whole. The two rays which directly affect the sign are, as we have seen, the fifth (through Venus) and the first
(through Vulcan). These two when viewed in combination with the Earth
(which is an expression of the third ray) demonstrate a most difficult
combination of rays, for all are along the line of the first Ray of Energy:
[394]
Ray 1.—The ray of Will or Power.
Ray 5.—The ray of Concrete Knowledge.
Ray 3.—The ray of Active Intelligence.
This combination tremendously increases the already difficult task of the
Taurian subject. Only indirectly does the second Ray of Love-Wisdom and
its subsidiary line of energies appear and, therefore, love and wisdom are
often noticeably lacking in the person born in this sign. Such a man will
have much self-love, self-esteem, self-respect and a good deal of selfish
centralisation or personality focus. He will be intelligent but not wise;
aspirational but at the same time stubborn and set so that his aspiration does
not take him very far very rapidly. He will move spasmodically and in wild
rushes; steady measured progress upon the Way is very hard for him. He
finds it difficult to apply practically the knowledge gained. It is apt to
remain a mental acquisition and not a practical experience. He will be
almost painfully conscious of duality but, instead of its producing a struggle
for unity, it produces often a set and static depression. He will be destructive
because “bull-headed” and because the hammer aspect of Vulcan will be
dominant. Because he has a measure of light—his power to be thus
destructive will distress him.
He needs to grasp the spiritual side of Venus which emphasises that the Son
of God who is the Son of mind is the instrument of God's love; he must
learn, therefore, to transmute knowledge into wisdom. He must transcend
the destructive side of Vulcan and so of the first ray and instead work as a
“fashioner of souls,” including his own. He must aim at clear seeing, pure
joyful will and the death of personality desire. Such is the goal of the
Taurian disciple. [395] Through the three other arms of the Fixed Cross and their three streams of
divine energy, the force of love can he brought indirectly to bear upon the
man born in Taurus. The rulers of two of these signs, Leo and Scorpio,
include the Sun (second ray), Mars (sixth ray) and Mercury (fourth ray).
The Sun and Mars are esoteric rulers of Leo and Scorpio and Mercury is the
hierarchical ruler of Scorpio. Uranus is the orthodox and Jupiter the esoteric
ruler of Aquarius. The Moon is also present but again veils Vulcan, whose
influence we have already considered. The only ray influence lacking is that
of the third ray and basically that is present also as it is the ray of Earth.
Therefore, in this important sign, the Taurian person is under the influence
—directly or indirectly—of all the seven rays for the reason that desire,
leading to final illumination, motivates them all. Such is the amazing
situation which faces the man—particularly the disciple or the initiate—who
is born in this sign. Such constitute the difficulties with which he is
confronted but such also bring about his immense opportunity for progress.
It will be apparent to you that a whole new field of study will open before
the astrologers of the New Age and fresh light on this greatest of all
sciences will be available when the investigator can determine the relative
age of the person or of the group whose destiny is to be determined and
whose horoscope is being cast. Each of these signs will eventually have to
be considered in such cases from:
1. The angle of the unevolved man who will be centred
a. In one or other of his vehicles.
b. In the integrated personality, prior to the Path experience.
In these, the Mutable Cross controls. [396]
2. The angle of the cycle of lives wherein the dualities are recognised
and the aspirant is then “reversing himself upon the Wheel.”
The Fixed Cross then controls.
3. The angle of the initiate.
Here the Cardinal Cross is beginning its control.
These Crosses are also known as: The Cross of the hidden Christ—The Mutable Cross
The Cross of the Crucified Christ—The Fixed Cross
The Cross of the Risen Christ—The Cardinal Cross
The individual, planetary and cosmic Crosses.
To determine these angles will involve among other things a close analysis
of the qualities of the four energies which play through each arm of the
Cross upon humanity. One aspect of this will eventually determine
statistically the average of the signs governing the various types of men.
It has been said that “four energies make a man; eight energies make a
Master; twelve energies make a Buddha of Activity.” During this process of
“fashioning,” great changes take place in consciousness and there are
fundamental changes wrought through this sign which—in combination
with its polar opposite, Scorpio—is one of the major conditioning signs of
the zodiac. Under its energy impact, profound disruptions and alterations in
character, quality and direction take place. It is a dangerous sign because the
destructive aspects are so easily over-emphasised and so intelligently
applied to circumstance that the career of the Bull can be both destructive
within its field of contacts and [397] at the same time self-destroying until
such time that self-will or selfish desire is tempered by aspiration.
Aspiration eventually gives place to intelligent activity and the acceptance
of the will emanating from the spiritual Centre of life. This leads to
cooperation with the Plan in the fullest sense and the end of individual selfcentredness. Temper, which is so characteristic of the Bull, must give place
to directed spiritual energy, for temper is but energy run wild in the interests
of the personality; blindness (for the Bull is blind for much of its career)
must give place to vision and the right focus of the sight and this will finally
dispel the self-engendered illusions and glamours of the aspirant; self-pity,
which is the effect of a constant concentration on the frustration of desire in
the personality life, must be succeeded by compassion for all humanity, and
this must be developed into the self-less service of the salvaging initiate.
The task of the Taurian is a hard one for he embodies in himself, to a
marked degree, outstanding limitations as regards the processes of spiritual evolution; there are, however, no insuperable difficulties and the liberated
Taurian is ever a constructive, planning, creative, forward-moving force;
such men are greatly needed in these serious days of re-adjustment and
strain.
Taurus, as you know, rules the neck and the thyroid gland. This is
essentially the region whence must emanate the creative activity of the man
who is upon the Path. The throat is a point to which the energy of the sacral
centre must be lifted so that creation through love and by the will eventually
will prove the sublimatory effect of the transference to higher use of the sex
energy. The right use of the organs of speech gives the clue to the processes
whereby the disciple must bring about certain basic changes. The Taurian
upon the way of liberation would do well to employ the [398] method of
directed and motivated speech of an outgoing and explanatory nature in
order to transform himself from one who goes wilfully on his personality
way into a wise cooperator with the Plan. By this I mean that, as man
translates his ideals into words and acts, he brings about transformation,
transmutation and eventually translation upon the mountain top of Initiation.
The results of this creative work of materialising the vision must be carried
to the point of effectual demonstration in Scorpio in which sign the final
tests are applied to prove that the energy is flowing freely and without
impediment and obstruction between the throat and sacral centres; to show
that right direction has been achieved and that there is no longer any fear
that the Taurian subject will blunder blindly forward again in his own selfinterest but will, in the future, move intelligently upon the Way of
Liberation—the way that brings about his own release and at the same time
sweeps him into those activities which bring about the release of others. In
Scorpio, the man who has mastered his lessons in Taurus must demonstrate
that creativity which will work under the inspiration of aspiration and vision
and constructively attempt to express the beauty which all forms
intrinsically veil, thus bringing to all revelation of that underlying purpose
which motivates all events and forms. All these aspects of basic change in
purpose, interest and orientation must manifest in Scorpio, thus proving the
effectiveness of the evolutionary processes undergone in the great repeated transition from Scorpio to Taurus and from Taurus to Scorpio. This cycle of
moves constitutes (with the greater cycle) a rhythm of experience of
tremendous moment. These seven signs are pre-eminently life-experience
signs. The preceding sign of Aries is the “sign of institution” [399] whilst
the four which come after Scorpio prove to be signs of discipleship and
initiation. This is on the reversed wheel and the implications along the same
line on the ordinary wheel can easily be applied by you.
It is the recognition of these goals and a grasp of the Taurian problems
which will make clear to you the position of the planets in this sign. I would
remind you again that the exaltation of a planet in any particular sign, its fall
within the sphere of influence of a sign as well as the lessening of a
particular planetary influence in any sign cycle (making it what has been
technically called “in detriment”) is purely symbolic of the effects of energy
as it impinges upon the form-nature, meeting resistance or non-resistance,
evoking response or non-response, according to the calibre of the planetary
instrument subjected to the impact. In this sign, the Moon is exalted.
Symbolically this means that the form side of life is a powerfully controlling
factor and one with which the man must ever reckon. The Moon is the
Mother of the form and in this case veils or hides Vulcan—which might be
expected. The Moon, therefore, stands here for the fashioner or moulder of
the form, bringing in both the feminine and masculine aspects of formbuilding, the dual functions of Father-Mother. This is a point for astrologers
to remember. This process of interplay brings about two phases of the
needed fashioning:
1. A process wherein is created a form of great potency in which selfinterest and personality aims and desires are the motives bringing
about activity. The Moon and Taurus activity.
2. The processes, self-applied by the awakening Taurian, wherein the
form nature is fashioned anew and motivated [400] in a different
manner and so is “raised up into Heaven” and thus irradiated and
glorified. The Vulcan and Taurus activity. The exaltation of the form, ruled by the Moon, can be traced throughout the
entire zodiac and provides in itself an interesting and progressive story with
which I have not at this time the intention to deal. It is told by the various
women who figure in the different constellations and around them some day
the astrology of the form will be built. There is Cassiopea, Venus, Coma
Berenice, Andromeda and one or two others, as well as Virgo, the Virgin,
the most important of them all. I can only indicate here a field of thought
and of astrological investigation hitherto untouched but I have not time for
the interpretation of this vast and profitable field of knowledge. “Our Lady,
the Moon” is related to all these and before the great disruption in an earlier
solar system which led to the Moon becoming a dead planet, the energies of
these stars and certain of the planets which were produced through their
activity, were all focussed in and transmitted by the Moon in a most
mysterious yet powerful manner. Through desire translated into terms of
spiritual will, the form is esoterically “exalted” and of this fact the exaltation
of the Moon in Taurus is a symbol. To this the ordinary astrological symbol
of the Bull's horns testifies. This is the crescent Moon and also the symbol
of the destructive nature of the form life of the Bull. Forget not that in this
connection the destruction or death of the form and the ending of form
influence thereby is the goal of the process which changes desire into
aspiration.
Uranus, the planet of the hidden mystery and one of the most occult of the
planets “falls” in this sign, producing [401] the accentuation and the sharp
division between body and soul which is so marked a characteristic of the
Taurian subject. It prepares the inner man for the sharp interplay and
conflict in the next sign, Gemini. The presence, therefore, of the exalted
Moon and the fallen Uranus gives a marvellous picture of man's history
during the stage of personality development and power. The task of Uranus,
hidden in the depths, is to awaken and evoke the intuitive response of
Taurus to an ever-increasing light until such time that full illumination is
achieved and also the development of the spiritual consciousness—
substituting these higher soul aspects for the lower form reactions. It is
interesting to note that in Scorpio, Uranus is exalted which gives indication of the success of the task which the Uranian forces undertook. Achievement
is attained.
Mars is in detriment in this sign. Its activity adds constantly to the naturally
warlike nature of Taurus but the potency of the Taurian struggle is so great,
esoterically speaking, that the effect of Mars is lost in the larger whole. It
“adds to the glamour and confusion and yet holds within itself hope for the
struggling man.”
Constantly in this sign comes the emphasis upon struggle. It is a cosmic,
planetary and individual struggle, for desire-will underlies the manifested
activities of the Logos, the planetary Life and of man and also of all forms
in nature. It is the struggle of that which is deeply hidden in darkness to
reach the light of day; it is the struggle of the hidden soul to dominate and
control the outer form, the struggle to transmute desire into aspiration and
aspiration into the will to achieve. It is the struggle to attain the goal which
an increasing light reveals. So potent is this struggle that on the ordinary
wheel it culminates (prior to the re-entry in Aries of the soul seeking
incarnation) by the fixed [402] desire, growing steadily stronger, to follow
the wheel of re-birth; on the reversed progress around the zodiac, the
struggle is to overcome and destroy all that has been so laboriously achieved
upon the ordinary wheel and to demonstrate in Scorpio (through the terrific
tests there applied) that the form no longer controls but that the lessons
learnt through the use of the form have been retained; the struggle is to
achieve initiation in Capricorn and thus release the soul from the revolving
wheel and achieve final liberation from the thralldom of desire and from
form control of any kind.
This is curiously emphasised by the rulers of the decanates in this sign. Both
the astrologers, Leo and Sepharial, practically and to all intents and
purposes, agree in their assignment of planets to govern the triple aspects of
the sign. They only vary exoterically on one point for Sepharial gives the
Moon as governing the second decan whilst Leo gives Venus as ruling the
first decan. However, Venus and the Moon are often used interchangeably
and both express or emanate the same basic energy of active intelligence in its higher and lower aspects. One expresses intelligent love and the other the
intelligence of matter; this dual emphasis is concerned with the dominance
of the form nature in the Taurian subject and his release through the
Venusian Son of Mind. The Moon or Venus, Mercury and Saturn control the
decanates and our consideration of these planets in the other signs will have
indicated to you their right interpretation, both here and elsewhere. Form
life, intelligent activity, and intense struggle summarises the Taurian
problem, whilst Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, reminds the struggling
man that he must become ever what he essentially is , thus escaping from
illusion and entering into light.
Keynotes of this sign are, as usual, clear in their implications. [403] One
states the note of the form aspect, “Let struggle be undismayed.” The Word
of the form is to take, grasp and go courageously after that which is desired.
The Word of the Soul is, “I see and when the Eye is opened, all is light.”
The eye of the cosmic Bull of God is open and from it light pours radiantly
forth upon the sons of men. The eye of vision of the individual man must
likewise open in response to this cosmic light. Hence victory is inevitable
for the potency of cosmic energy will unfailingly and in time subdue and reorient the energy of humanity.
We have now considered briefly and yet I believe instructively certain of the
subjective influences and significances of the twelve signs of the zodiac. We
have touched upon their mutual inter-relation and their planetary interplay
and have sought to portray the reactions of humanity to these multiple
energies and forces. These forces, pouring out from cosmic sources, find
their way into our solar system, being attracted thereto through analogous
quality or—under the Law of Contradictions or the Law of Contraries—find
their way to certain planets. Thus they affect and condition units of life upon
each of these receiving planets. We have seen man incited to progress by the
nature of the forces of divine attraction and have noted the differing divine
qualities which this play of energies evokes in humanity—as well as in all
other forms of life. We have perhaps emphasised almost to the point of
bewilderment the vast aggregation of impelling energies which play throughout our cosmos; individual man may well be stunned by a sense of
his helplessness and his unique futility. But this is only due to the relatively
undeveloped state of his “receiving apparatus.” When thus bewildered let
him remember that potentially he possesses the creative ability to build and
gradually to develop a better mechanism of reception which [404] will
enable him finally to be responsive to all impacts and to every type of divine
energy. This capacity is indestructible and is itself a divine focus of energy
which must and will without fail carry forward the good undertaken under
the inspiration of The Great Architect of the Universe. He fashions all things
to a divinely foreseen end and in this sign—through His agents, Venus and
Vulcan, typifying the form and the soul—will lead man from the unreal to
the real. CHAPTER III - The Science of Triangles
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
[407] We have been working for some time now upon the third part of our
study of the Zodiac and the Rays. This entire section deals with the nature of
esoteric astrology and, under our introductory remarks, we considered very
briefly the significance of esotericism as a whole when applied to modern
astrology; we considered the three Crosses and referred, again very briefly, to
the relation of the signs to the centres; we gave most of our time, however, to
an analysis of the meaning and inter-relation of the twelve signs of the zodiac
to each other, to the planets, and to the Earth. We dealt scarcely at all with
their effect upon the individual except in a general sense. Now we begin to
take up the third and most important part of this astrological study, entitled
The Science of Triangles. This study will fall into three parts as I earlier
indicated:
1. Triangles of Energy—constellations.
2. Triangles of Force—planetary triplicities.
3. The Triangles and the Centres—planetary and human.
I have analysed here the point reached in our studies, as I am anxious for you
to know as far as possible just where we stand in our attempt to throw the
light of esoteric understanding [408] upon the present entirely exoteric study
of astrology.
Before, however, proceeding with our somewhat difficult theme there are a
few words I would like to say in reference to our general attitude, and certain
things of which I would remind you.
In no place have I attempted to give any of the mathematics connected with
my statements in this series of astrological studies. Certain basic changes in
the orientation of the Earth’s axis are now taking place, and these will throw
much confusion into the computations of astrologers. These changes are
proceeding slowly and progressively and according to cosmic law. Whilst
they are in progress, accuracy of computation and deduction is unattainable. When the orientation and “pointed direction” of the Earth’s pole has again
been stabilised, the new conditioning, mathematical figures can be again
ascertained. There has indeed been no true accuracy since ancient Egyptian
days. Anything now possible along these lines can only be regarded as
approximate, and, therefore, certainty in analysis, prediction and
interpretation is not possible. This whole subject is one of the greatest
obscurity and quite incomprehensible to the average astrologer and certainly
to the average student. I would remind you, however, that several times in the
great life cycle of the Earth, there have been changing “pole-stars” and that
our present pole-star has not always held that position. This science itself
recognises.
At each of the great shifts in the Earth’s axis, there has been upheaval,
confusion and cataclysm, preceding reconstruction, stabilisation and relative
quiet. Of these macrocosmic events there are similar microcosmic
correspondences in the lives of both humanity and individual man. Hence the
present world crisis—though precipitated by human [409] error and
sinfulness, by past Karma and emerging idealism (responsive to the
development of the intellect and the appearance of the intuition)—is basically
the result of much greater and vaster combinations of force currents in
macrocosmic relations.
Briefly it might be said that the following cosmic and systemic causes are
responsible for the present world crisis and the present difficult world
situation:
1. A welling up of magnetic force on Sirius, which produces effects upon
our solar system and particularly upon our Earth, via the Hierarchy.
2. A shift in the Earth’s polarity, due to the pull of a great cosmic centre.
This powerfully affects the Earth’s orientation and is responsible for the
present earthquakes, and for the volcanic eruptions and the many
earthquakes during the past one hundred and fifty years.
3. The great sweep of the sun around the greater zodiac (a period of
250,000 years, or a complete round) came to an end when the sun
entered Pisces over two thousand years ago. This process of passing out of, or entering into, a particular sign and cyclic influence covers a
period of five thousand years where this greater round or cycle is
concerned. This period of five thousand years covers the complete
cycle of transition until complete freedom to function under the
inspiration of the new sign is completed. We are, therefore, not yet free
from incidental turmoil. Júpiter . The passing of our Sun out of the sign Pisces into the sign Aquarius is
another of the conditions bringing about the present confusion. This
confusion of forces in the solar system is notably affecting our planet.
In the process of passing from sign to sign, as for instance [410]
transitting out of Pisces into Aquarius as is now the case, the period
covered is approximately five hundred years.
These are points which astrologers would do well to consider. I would remind
students again that when speaking of signs I am referring to the influences of
the constellations as they are represented by the signs, calling to your
attention that in the great evolutionary process and owing to certain shifts and
astronomical-astrological discrepancies, the Sun is not in the constellation to
which a particular sign refers at any given moment. This I called to your
attention in an earlier part of this treatise.
5. Another factor little known is that the Moon today is disintegrating with
increasing rapidity and this necessarily affects the Earth and produces
terrestrial results.
Students would find it of interest to make the following applications of these
great cyclic events to their own “appearance” and functioning processes in
time and space:
1. The succession of the greater rounds of the zodiac or a period of cycles
of approximately 250,000 years has a correspondence to the life cycle
of the Monad.
2. The progress of the Sun as it passes through the signs in the zodiac
during one of these 25,000 year cycles finds its analogy in the life cycle
of the ego or soul. 3. The lesser zodiac covered—from the angle of extreme illusion—in the
course of one year, corresponds to the life of the personality.
In considering these points it should always be remembered that great shifts in
consciousness, or great expansions of awareness, are followed inevitably by
upheaval in the outer forms. This is true in the life of the solar Deity, of a
planetary [411] Logos, of humanity as a whole and of a man. Hence again
today’s world problem. A major event such as a change in the axis of the
Earth is related to an initiation of the planetary Logos. Students can here note,
therefore, the relation to the individual life as it shifts its consciousness
steadily in the vital unfolding processes of the Path of Discipleship and of
Initiation. Earlier in this treatise I referred to a fact which must always be
borne in mind and that is that the great energies, playing upon our planet,
exert a hindering or a stimulating effect. They are either retarding in their
effects, producing concretion, crystallisation and a holding back or on to that
which is old and of the past, or they stimulate and produce fluidity,
enlargement and expansion. The careful student of human affairs will note
this as he studies the events which are today passing before his eyes.
Speaking with a wide generalisation, it might he said that the three major
groups of forces affecting our planet are zodiacal, systemic and planetary in
nature and—again generalising—it might also be said that:
1. Zodiacal energies pass through Shamballa and are related to the first
Ray of Will or Power and affect the Monad.
2. Systemic energies pass through the Hierarchy and are related to the
second Ray of Love-Wisdom or (as it is oft called in esoteric astrology)
the Ray of Attractive Coherency and affect the soul.
3. Planetary forces impinge upon and pass through humanity and are
related to the third Ray of Active Intelligence and affect the personality.
To this I earlier referred, but have restated it here as I seek to have it definitely
in your minds as we go forward [412] with our new studies. You have here a
major trinity of energies, emerging out of a vast and incomprehensible
aggregation of forces and energies which stands to them as the One Life
stands to this lesser important triangle. It must also be remembered that this triple group of energies produces
differing effects according to the type of mechanism (itself dependent upon
the point in evolution and the stage of development) upon which it impinges.
The effect, for instance, of zodiacal and systemic force upon a sacred or a
non-sacred planet is widely distinctive, just as the effect of these energies as
they make their impact upon man will depend upon whether response is
evoked from the monad, the ego or the personality, whether they impinge
upon the mass consciousness, the self-conscious unit or the illumined
consciousness of humanity, or whether in fact—as far as man is concerned—
they play upon unevolved man, upon evolved man or upon disciples and
initiates. The type of mechanism, and the quality of the consciousness
determines reception and response. This is a statement of basic importance
and until astrologers can arrive at the point of development where the world
of true meaning is open to them and where the scope of their consciousness is
widely inclusive, it will not be possible for them to be truly accurate in their
interpretations of group or individual horoscopes. I am bringing this point up
as the whole science of Triangles relates entirely to subjective energies as they
condition the consciousness and not to the conditioning brought about by the
same energies upon the outer forms upon the physical plane .
You may here rightly remark that “as a man thinketh so is he” and that this
expression of energy will amount to the same thing in the last analysis. But
this is not exactly true. The response of humanity or of the individual man
[413] to the inner thought life and to the subjective consciousness is not
immediate. It takes much time (especially in the early stages), for an idea to
work through into the mind and from thence to the brain, conditioning the
emotional nature in its progress and processes. Several lives may, therefore,
be given to the registering of the effects of these energies upon the thought
life and the response of the physical plane life once they are comprehended. It
is for this reason that I have stated that the Science of the Triangles underlies
the whole system of astrology and is only now in process of revelation. Bear
in mind that the effect of these energies which we shall be considering and of
their triple relationship will be in the realm of ideas and in the world of consciousness and its expansion, and will embrace, therefore, the sentient
thought life of a solar Logos, of a planetary Logos, of humanity and of man.
It will not, therefore, deal with the producing of events except in so far that all
ideas work out into expression upon the plane of manifestation—such
working out being, I again repeat, dependent upon the quality and nature of
the apparatus of response, be it a solar system, a planet, the fourth kingdom in
nature, or a human being.
I would add here a sixth reason for the present strain and stress in the
response of the human family in this world crisis because it is related to the
entire question of conscious response to subjective forces, expressing
themselves as ideas and vast thought currents. This is the fact that humanity
as a whole is today reversing itself upon the great zodiacal wheel just as the
individual disciple does; the point of reversal and the sign or signs in which it
takes place mark a momentous point of crisis in the life of this kingdom in
nature, producing upheaval, difficulty and a whole gamut of readjustments,
necessitated by the re-orientation. [414] If you add this reason to the other
five, your will not be astonished that the situation is today almost fantastic in
its difficulty and the extent of the involvement.
In every triplicity, there are three major qualities manifesting or three basic
energies seeking expression and influence. As he manifests in time and space,
man discovers this to be true and to constitute a law in nature, and it might be
said that the task of the disciple is to become consciously aware—like a
detached onlooking Observer—of these energies and their expressing
qualities as they function within himself. This he does upon the Path of
Probation, the Path of Discipleship and the Path of Initiation. He has to
become aware of:
1. The threefold energy which is the personality, and of which the vital
body is the synthetic expression.
2. The threefold soul of which the egoic lotus is the expression.
3. The triple monad of which a great diffusion in time and space in three
streams of creative energy is the expression. This last definition is somewhat meaningless to the uninitiate but must
suffice. There is a manifesting aspect in all these triplicities which is the result
of, and conditioned by, the interplay of the three forces. It is their full
expression and the result of their successful activity.
1. In the personality, it is the physical body.
2. In the soul, it is the unfolded central bud within the egoic lotus.
3. In the monad, it is the “sound which geometrically forces itself into the
vision of the beholder”—a deeply esoteric mode of symbolising that
which cannot be expressed or reduced to the tangibility of form.
[415] If students will bring this idea to the study and understanding of the
astrological triangles and will refuse to lose sight of the related triple energies,
they will greatly simplify their studies. The microcosm, when known, holds
ever the clue to the Macrocosm. The Macrocosm eternally reflects itself in
man, the microcosm, and hence man has within himself the possibility and the
potentiality of total comprehension.
Therefore, in all the many triplicities which we shall study, we shall find
correspondences to the monad, the soul and the personality in man; we shall
find one line of the triangle embodying determining and dominating force and
two lines which—during a particular cycle—are conditioned by it. For
instance, you have an interesting illustration of this in the nature of fire,
esoterically understood, in its triple expression in time and space during a
cycle of manifestation, for—as you know—the Ageless Wisdom teaches that
there is:
1. Electric fire . . . . . . .
2. Solar fire . . . . . . . . .
3. Fire by Friction . . . . will . . . . . . . . .
love-wisdom . .
activity . . . . . . monad . . . . . . .
soul . . . . . . . . .
personality . . . . Initiatory fire.
Qualificatory fire.
Purificatory fire. Intellectual. I point out this triplicity as it is one which is familiar to you and at the same
time constitutes a good illustration of a basic law. 1. Triangles of Energy—Constellations.
Lying behind all the many interlocking triangles in our solar system and
conditioning them to a very large extent (though today more potentially than expressively) are three energies coming from three major constellations. They
are the emanations from the Great Bear, from the Pleiades and from Sirius. It
might be pointed out that: [416]
1. The energies coming from the Great Bear are related to the will or
purpose of the solar Logos and are to this great Being what the monad
is to man. This is a deep mystery and one which even the highest
initiate cannot yet grasp. Its sevenfold unified energies pass through
Shamballa .
2. The energies coming from the sun, Sirius, are related to the lovewisdom aspect or to the attractive power of the solar Logos, to the soul
of that Great Being. This cosmic soul energy is related to the Hierarchy.
You have been told that the great White Lodge on Sirius finds its
reflection and a mode of spiritual service and outlet in the great White
Lodge of our planet, the Hierarchy .
3. The energies coming from the Pleiades, an aggregation of seven
energies, are connected with the active intelligent aspect of logoic
expression, and influence the form side of all manifestation. They focus
primarily through Humanity .
Connected with this major triangle and affecting powerfully our entire solar
system is a triple inter-relation of great interest, which has a special and
peculiar relation to humanity. This triangle of forces relates one of these
major constellations, one of the zodiacal signs and one of the sacred planets
within our solar system.
First Triangle:
The Pleiades . . . . . Cancer . . . . . . . . . . . Venus. Humanity .
Second Triangle:
The Great Bear . . . Aries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Shamballa .
Third Triangle: Pluto. Sirius . . . . . . . . . . Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Jupiter. Hierarchy .
[417] I wonder if you can grasp at least partially and symbolically the fact
that these triangles must not be thought of as placed , static and eternally the
same, or even as three dimensional. They must be regarded as in rapid
movement, revolving eternally in space and ceaselessly moving onward and
as of fourth and fifth dimensional extension. There is no way of depicting
them or of bringing them visually to your attention, for only the inner eye of
vision can imagine their progression, position or appearance. These three
major triangles are only partially as yet in expression as far as our solar
system is concerned and only one point of the great triangle—as for instance
one point of the Great Bear—constitutes with Aries a related line of force;
only one point of Aries—within itself or within its own range of interplay
with Leo and Capricorn (see Tabulation VIII) is related to Pluto. Therefore
the entire cosmic web and solar system is an intricate, constantly moving,
interwoven series of triangles wherein each point of a triangle emanates three
lines or streams of energy (nine in all); it is likewise responsive to and
receptive of the energies—likewise triple in nature—which lie within its
periphery or sphere of influence and vibratory activity.
It is useless for students to attempt to unravel this aggregation of interlacing
streams of energy. All that is now possible for man with his present
equipment is to accept hypothetically these statements anent certain major
triangles which affect humanity and seek to prove their effect and to
endeavour to arrive at some understanding of that intricate, interwoven
network which he himself possesses and to which [418] he gives the name
“etheric body.” Thus he may succeed in proving the accuracy of a statement
by the demonstrated quality of the life aspect, its conditioning and results in
the microcosmic life history and events. This astrology has nought to do in
connection with tangible happenings on the outer plane of existence; we,
however, will see to it that our effort lies along the line of psychological life
history and events and not along the line of physical occurrences . This
difference is basic and must ever be borne in mind. Astrologers have begun to
grasp a dim idea of the interlocking triangles of energy as far as our Earth is concerned in the rather arbitrary division of the twelve constellations into four
triplicities, covered by such qualifying terms as earthy triplicity or fiery
triplicity, composed each of a cardinal, a fixed and a mutable sign. They thus
divide up the entire zodiac into a fourfold group of interlacing and interrelated
triads, each conditioned by one of the basic elements and thus qualified.
These constitute a series of basic triangles with a definite reference to our
planetary life. Owing to the constant movement everywhere, inherent in the
solar system and the zodiac—onward, interior and revolving—some idea can
be grasped of the intricacy of the entire pattern. A further aid to the grasping
of this essential beauty of coordinated and organised movement and its power
to qualify and condition the entire universal pattern can be gained by those
students who have studied somewhat the various triangles to be found in the
etheric body of man through the inter-relation of the seven centres to which I
have referred elsewhere in my various books. These centres, when awakened
and alive, are swept finally within the radius of each others’ sphere of action;
from the point of view of living energy, the circumference of these wheels or
vortices of force becomes so enlarged that they eventually [419] overlap and
touch, presenting on a tiny scale a condition analogous to the contacting and
interlocking series of triangles such as those referred to above.
Behind these concepts of the relation existing in time and space between the
constellations of the Great Bear, the Pleiades and the sun, Sirius, and our solar
system, there exists, it must be remembered, an immense series of
interlocking triangles between the stars which compose these constellations
interiorly and our solar system. You have, therefore, a relationship between:
1. The seven stars, composing the Great Bear.
2. The seven stars, composing the Pleiades, sometimes called the seven
“sisters” or “wives” of the Rishis or informing Lives of the Great Bear.
3. The sun, Sirius.
These compose major triangles of force and all are held within the radius of
the Life of that Great Being Whose expressed, manifested intention is brought
into being through the medium of these three related groups and our solar
system. As hinted by me in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire , these four groups of stars constitute the manifested aspect or personality of a great and unknown
Life.
I seek in this connection to give only a general picture because, with these
cosmic triangles, I have no intention to deal. We will only consider those
constellations within the greater zodiac which are known by astrologers to
have a definite effect upon humanity and our planetary life.
Therefore, in studying these triangles, we will make (for our guidance) certain
rules which, under the Law of Analogy, may facilitate our comprehension of
the underlying meaning and truths. [420]
1. All triangles studied will be regarded as expressing:
a. A major conditioning energy, producing manifestation.
This corresponds to the Monad aspect.
b. A secondary qualifying energy producing consciousness.
This corresponds to the Ego or Soul aspect.
c. A lesser expression of force, producing tangibility.
This corresponds to the Personality aspect.
2. These three energies will be related, therefore, to the three aspects of
manifested life. These have been termed throughout this treatise: Life, Quality
and Appearance.
3. These energies change within themselves and sometimes one will strike the
dominating note and sometimes another; sometimes a secondary energy will
become a major conditioning force and sometimes the lesser expression will
come to the top and become, for the cycle, the outstanding characteristic of
the triangle. Such cosmic events are governed by a great Law of Expediency,
evoked by the evolutionary process and incident also to zodiacal movement
and its own interior mathematical conditioning—a subject of such vast
dimensions and mystery that no Life within our solar system has more than
sensed its significance. The cyclic expression of life is dependent upon
constant mutation and infinitely changing processes. Júpiter . The statements made by me in this attempt—for it is little more—to
indicate the main lines of approach to the new science of esoteric astrology,
may not yet be capable of any proof. Later on such proof will be available.
All that I can ask of you at this time is to be [421] interested in the
presentation, to strive to see the general picture I am seeking to present and to
grasp somewhat the relative synthesis which underlies all manifestation.
Starting from that which is today accepted, be willing to move on from there
into new fields of possibility and of sensed probability . Time will justify the
information I ask you to accept as hypothesis.
Next I will deal with an analysis of three groups of triangles which are of
major importance to humanity at this time and which follow upon information
earlier given. These groups of triangles emanate energies which reach through
space to the individual man and, therefore, cannot he ignored. They are:
The Great Bear
Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Saturn . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Planetary head centre. .
Disciple's head centre .
The base of the spine. . The Pleiades
Transmit energy via

These transmit energy via
Mercury . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Reaching the following centres
Planetary ajna centre . . . . . . . .
From thence to
Disciple's ajna centre . . . . . . .
and eventually control
The throat centre . . . . . . . . . . . Sirius
Pisces
Uranus
Planetary heart
Disciple's heart centre
the solar plexus I will also take up with you some of the points and indications which are
hinted at in Tabulation IX, relating to the twelve signs of the zodiac, to be
found on page 423. Certain major streams of conditioning energies will be
seen related to each other and to our Earth and these fall into two groups:
1. The ray energies which we are told emanate from the Great Bear in
seven great out-raying streams of force. [422]
2. The inherent energies of the twelve constellations which blend with the
ray energies, producing the essential dualism of manifested life, and
incidentally are responsible for the peculiar difficulties confronting
humanity on the are of evolutionary experience upon our planet. Again I would repeat that what I shall have to say will be related to present
world conditions, to humanity and also—for practical teaching and
application—to the life of the individual disciple. Necessarily, these energies
have a cosmic, systemic and planetary significance but these no disciple can
as yet grasp; personality has to be transcended before even the earlier stages
of the understanding of these mysteries become possible, and this
transcendence is something you have not yet accomplished but which some
day inevitably you will.
Once man is impersonal and free from the reactions of the lower self, and his
consciousness is illumined by the clear light of the intuition, then his
“window of vision” becomes clarified and his sight into reality is unimpeded.
Obstructions (always erected by humanity itself) are removed and he sees all
life and form in their true relation and can comprehend, and even occultly
“see,” the “passage of the energies.”
The relationship of certain rays and cosmic triangles may become clearer to
you if the following tabulation is studied with care.
NOTE: The seven stars of the Great Bear are the originating sources of the
seven rays of our solar system. The seven Rishis (as They are called) of the
Great Bear express Themselves through the medium of the seven planetary
Logoi Who are Their Representatives and to Whom They stand in the relation
of cosmic Prototype. The seven [423] planetary Gods manifest through the
medium of the seven sacred planets. Each of these seven rays is transmitted
into our solar system through the medium of three constellations and their
ruling planets.

Saturn At this time, I purpose to trace certain major conditioning streams of energy,
as they proceed forth from their emanating source—via certain constellations
and planets—to the Earth and, from within the radius of the Earth, reach the
individual disciple, again via certain major planetary [424] centres. In this
way that great Synthesis (which is qualified Life in appearance or
manifestation) can be seen in definite activity, producing solar, planetary and
individual effects and thus demonstrating that intricate relation which unites
the human atom to the great Lives Who are the sum total of that which is
manifested.
The analogy between the microcosm and macrocosm will, therefore, be
helpful, and the relation of a cell or atom in one of the abdominal organs (for
instance) to the soul on its own plane will illustrate with accuracy a still
greater relationship and interplay. In this interplay of Lives and Their
emanating streams of forces and energies and in the major determining life
activities of That in which all forms—including the human—live and move
and have their being is to be found the inevitability of ultimate achievement,
the unalterability of law and the expression finally of divine unchangeable
Purpose. In the evolutionary effects of this relation of Life to Form is to be
found also the undeviating way of an expanding, ever-unfolding consciousness—whether it be macrocosmic or microcosmic. Hence, the Will
of God moves the worlds and the Love of God determines results.
In this consideration of the basic Science of Triangles (I had well-nigh said
“in the contemplation of the basic Science of Triangles,” for that is what it
necessarily should be if understanding is to be the real reward of our efforts)
the relation of the three basic energies affecting our solar system and the
predominant effect of one of them in any cyclic expression in time and space
must always be borne in mind. One illustration of this normally emerges in
our minds if it be remembered that in this world cycle in our systemic
manifestation it is the second or consciousness aspect (that of the second
Logos) which is the dominant [425] conditioning factor, which sets the note
for evolutionary development and which engrosses the attention of the
evolving human units. This is the case even when other factors are present
and active. Therefore, all approaches to truth and to knowledge must, in this
cycle, be in consciousness . In another cycle such an approach may be
focussed in the will or even in some already present but unrealised divine
attribute, for which we have as yet no name. All that any man can
consequently bring to the comprehension of life experience or to the
understanding of such an occult science as the Science of Triangles is a
consciousness which is developed to a certain definite and personal point of
perception or awareness. This point of perception is itself dependent upon
individual unfoldment and also upon the state of awareness of humanity as a
whole. This connotes two different though inter-related conditions of
perception.
Speaking technically, perception and response or the activity of the
perceiving, observing consciousness—carried on through the medium of the
mechanism of response—is dependent upon the condition or “aliveness” of
the centres or their quiescence. This is true of a man galvanised into activity
through his seven centres, of a planetary Logos functioning through seven
planetary centres, of a solar Logos functioning through still greater centres of
vibratory reaction, or still greater Lives, functioning through an aggregate of
solar systems. Upon this activity and its understanding depends the whole science of astrology; in this statement I give you a clue which may some day
revolutionise the present approach to astrology.
The twelve signs of the zodiac fall into two groups of signs, and their related
synthesis has much to do with the Science of Triangles. They are: [426]
1. Seven signs related to the unfoldment of planetary consciousness upon
Earth and only incidentally involving the fourth Creative Hierarchy, the
Human Hierarchy.
2. Five signs related to the unfoldment, in time and space, of the Human
Hierarchy. These five signs are of major conditioning importance and
may be enumerated as follows:
a. Cancer
b. Leo
c. Scorpio
d. Capricorn
e. Pisces
These five signs are related in the planetary sense to the five great races
of which our present race, the Aryan, is the fifth. These five races,
under the influence of the five signs, produce the externalisations
which are called the five continents—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia,
America. These five continents are to the planetary Life what five
major endocrine glands are to the human being. They are related to
five centres.
All these appearances, expressions of qualities and material evidences of life
are the symbols or outer and visible signs of inner and spiritual realities or of
Life, whatever you may mean by that term. For our purposes, we could define
Life as the energy emanating from certain great Lives Who stand behind our
solar system as its life and source, much as the Monad stands behind the
appearance of a man upon the physical plane or of the soul upon its own level.
Man, it might be stated, is the expression of seven principles and of the life
expression or activity of five planes. In this 7 + 5 is to be found the clue to the
mystery of the seven and the five zodiacal constellations. [427] Within this sum total of active, qualified energies, we have (working
out today) influences and impulses from three major constellations. These
pour through certain other related constellations and planets into the three
major planetary centres: Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity. It is with
these three centres I would seek to deal and to them and their inter-relations
continually make reference. I would ask you to bear in mind that these
energies are transmitted from one point to another, or pass through with
transmuting effect from one centre to another, thus bearing their own
vibratory quality but carrying also that of the centre of transmission. In the
transit of energy from a major centre to a human being and when the energy is
finally grounded in the disciple’s centre, you will notice that it is then a fusion
of six energies. These three groups of energies (each of them a fusion of six)
make the dominating energies, controlling the human being, to number
eighteen; this holds the clue to the mystery of the “mark of the beast” which is
666. This is the number of the active intelligent man and distinguishes his
form nature from his spiritual nature which is 999. These three lines or
streams of energy in man may be listed as follows: 1.

structure therein of many triangles of force; some of these are cosmic, some
zodiacal, others systemic, still others planetary and their reflections in the
etheric body of the disciples of the world of all grades. Through the great
triangle of Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity, cosmic, zodiacal and
systemic force is focussed and these three become, in their turn, a
macrocosmic triangle of energies in relation to the individual human being
upon the planet. You have, therefore, the following lines of transmission of
force:
Shamballa Hierarchy Humanity Head centre.
Base of the spine. Heart centre.
Solar plexus. Ajna Centre.
Throat. One major centre is here omitted because it is primarily related to the physical
body and its expression of life perpetuation. That is the sacral centre. Just as
the physical body is regarded by true esotericists as not a principle so the
sacral centre is regarded as “a necessary evocation between that which is high
and that which is low, and between that which is sounded forth from the
centre in the throat and that which replies to a deeply sounded note.”
In this connection there is an interesting triangle of energy formed by: [429]
1. The egoic lotus.
2. The throat centre.
3. The sacral centre.
This triangle when functioning produces a subsidiary triangle of force which
is formed by:
1. The throat centre.
2. The sacral centre.
3. The physical body—symbolised by the organs of reproduction.
Let me pause a moment here to point out that in this study of the Triangles it
is not possible for us to do more than study certain of the major groups of
triangles and a few of the most important triangles where humanity itself is
concerned. It is of value for human beings to realise that there are other evolutions and other forms of logoic expression of equal importance to their
own. There is, in truth, a veritable multiplicity of triangles. For the triangle is
the basic geometric form of all manifestation and it is to be seen (by those
who have eyes to see) underlying the entire fabric of manifestation, whether it
is the manifestation of a solar system, the manifestation of the zodiacal round,
the cosmic triplicities or the tiny reflection of this divine triple whole which
we call man. When the human being is manifest but is not yet truly
manifested, the triangles which symbolise this manifestation are the two eyes
and the third eye:
1. The right eye—the eye of buddhi, of wisdom and of vision.
2. The left eye—the eye of mind, of the commonsense and of sight. [430]
3. The eye of Shiva—the all-seeing eye, the eye which directs the will and
purposes of Deity.
These three are, in reality,
1. The eye of the Father—carrying light from the Great Bear.
2. The eye of the Son—carrying light from Sirius.
3. The eye of the Mother—carrying light from the Pleiades.
and it is this latter “light energy” which is necessarily peculiarity active when
the sign of Taurus is dominant in any planetary and individual horoscope.
In some unusual manner (from the human angle), all that concerns the
development of mankind has been—down the ages—expressed by him in
terms of illumination and knowledge, in terms of sight and of the entrance of
light, thus leading to revelation and (incidentally) to the true theme of
astrological interpretation. From this peculiar angle, therefore, we can
approach the great Triangles with which we are today concerned and deal also
with their significance in terms of Light. This significance and approach can
be summed up in the following stanzas from the Old Commentary which—if
studied carefully—will throw much light upon the theme of this particular
subject:
I. “The sevenfold light of the Father brought from chaos into the ordered
day His purpose and His plan. The seven supreme Gods bent to this
purpose and with united will ordained the Plan.
The Bear and the Lion met together and laid their plans [431] in
conformity with the plan and with the purpose of their controlling Lord.
They called on Father Time (Saturn. A.A.B.) for aid and strength and he
responded to their triple call. To this call likewise the Eternal Youth
responded (Sanat Kumara, Lord of Shamballa); He set Himself anew to
learn the plan, aided by Father Time yet unaffected by the Lord of Time for
He Himself was timeless, though not the Lives which He enfolded in His
thought and Plan....
Then the triple light which came from the Bear in His high place, from
Leo in his lesser place and from Saturn in his little place poured into the
planetary place of power. Shamballa was informed. The Lord of Life and of
the World took action....
The little one within the greater Whole (the individual human disciple.
A.A.B.) likewise responded to the triple light but not until the cycles passed
and passed again. Late in the day of time, Shamballa sent a call, relayed
from voice to voice and rolling forward on the O.M. The disciple, hearing
that sound, lifted his head; an impulse from the base mounted in time and
space. Leo within the heart and head shouted aloud and stood whilst Saturn
did his work ... and thus the twain were one. Gêmeos .
The central light of Sirius shone through the eye of the Son; the vision
came. The light of wisdom penetrated into the waters and cast the radiance
of the Heavens into the depths. At this attractive call, the goddess rose unto
the surface (the fish-goddess, the symbol of Pisces. A.A.B.) and welcomed
the light within the depths and grasped it as her own. She saw the Sun,
having seen her Son, and from [432] that day the Sun has never left her.
There is no darkness. There is always light.
And then the heavens within the ring-pass-not responded to the light
from Sirius which, passing through the sea of Pisces, lifted the fishes into the heavenly sphere (Uranus) and thus a lesser triple light appeared, the
radiant sun of suns, the watery light of Pisces, the heavenly light of Uranus.
This light descended on the waiting sphere and lit the galaxy of little lights
upon the Earth. A Hierarchy of Light emerged from its own place; the
planet was alight.
III.
The little one upon that little world responded slowly to that light until
today the little world of men begins to throb in rhythmic unison. Changes
are wrought. The cosmic heart, the heart systemic and the little heart of
man begin to beat as one and as this beat pulsates with greater strength it
blends a lower note (that of the solar plexus. A.A.B.) within itself, removes
its harshness and its note of fear and thus it ends illusion. And then again
the two are one.
IV.
The seven Mothers blend their light and make it six (refers to the lost
Pleiad, A.A.B.) and yet the seven still are there. Their light is different from
the other lights. This light evokes response from that which shouts aloud: ‘I
am the densest point of all the concrete world (Capricorn. A.A.B.). I am a
tomb; I also am the womb. I am the rock which sinks itself into the deep of
matter. I am the mountain-top on which the Son is born on which the [433]
Sun is seen and that which catches the first rays of light.’ To me a
Messenger comes forth (Mercury. A.A.B.) and says ‘the Dayspring from on
high is on the way, sent by the Father to the Mother.’ Upon his way unto
this nether star we call the Earth he stopped at a bright sun where shines the
light of love (Sirius. A.A.B.) and there received the accolade of love. So
thus he brings bright gifts to man. For he is man himself and from these
three (The Pleiades, Capricorn, Mercury. A.A.B.) Man takes a nature which
is his today. Son of the Mother, born from the tomb and showing after birth
the light which he has taken from them all.
Then to the lower three he turns and to these souls in prison he in time
becomes a Messenger. Thus does the Lord of Mercury repeat himself. The Son descends again into the place of earth and iron. Again he knows His
mother.
And thus the little one upon the littlest sphere becomes the greatest God.
From the directing centre of his life on Earth he toils and works and carries
out the Plan. (The ajna centre is the directing centre. A.A.B.) He too
awakens to the need and from the chosen place (the throat centre. A.A.B.)
he utters forth the Sound which in time becomes the Word. And then the
three are twain and these are One.”
Again and repeatedly, students must remind themselves that we are
considering the impact of energy upon energy units (all qualified and
producing appearance) and with the response of those energy units to the
streams of force which reach them from “the furthest centre.” It is in the
development of response to distant points of contact and [434] emanating
sources of energy that the needed sensitivity is produced. Sensitivity,
generally speaking, is of a threefold nature:
1. Sensitivity to that which is found within oneself. This, when the
consciousness is adequately self-sufficient, opens a door for the
entrance of energies coming from the “middle centre.” I speak in
symbols and for those whose knowledge of cosmic location and of
points in time and space will enable them to comprehend; to the
uninitiate, I simply say, “Respond to soul impact.”
2. Sensitivity to that which emanates from the “centres left behind” or to
those streams of vital energy which lie active and focussed below the
threshold of the waking consciousness. They stir the threads of
memory; they draw backward the glances (and there lies magic in the
energy of the eye) of the onward moving Point, the Pilgrim on his way;
they condition through ancient habit the responsiveness of the units in
the form.
3. A developed sensitivity which emerges from the “furthest centre” at first
unconsciously employed and later consciously directed and attuned—a
fully magnetic and attractive sensitivity. Forget not that true interplay imposes the condition of reciprocity and that the two points or termini
of a line eventually vibrate in unison.
A consideration of a hint given earlier as to the symbolism and significance of
the three eyes available for man’s use will be found illuminating and their
relation to the heart and throat will prove evocative of knowledge. They relate
to the three centres above referred to and in their wider connotation relate to
the three planetary centres: Humanity, Hierarchy and Shamballa; further back
still lies a relation to the cosmic centres of the Great Bear, Sirius and [435]
the Pleiades. In between these planetary centres to which I have referred and
their distant cosmic archetypes lie three systemic centres which at this time
and under cyclic law are Saturn, Uranus and Mercury. In between these again
are to be found a zodiacal triangle of Leo, Pisces and Capricorn. For purposes
of our immediate consideration the following three triangles are, therefore, to
be found: When the significance of this is grasped, the following interesting points will
appear. I give them to you for what they are worth to you and that worth is dependent upon the goal ahead of you, and where you stand today in time and
space.
Triangle Three depicts the interplay of three streams of force which, in this
particular world cycle condition and basically influence ordinary humanity.
Forget not that humanity itself constitutes a great centre in the life of the
planetary Logos:
a. Capricorn connotes density, firm foundations, concretisation, the
mountain of karma that holds down the [436] struggling soul or the
mountain of initiation which must eventually be climbed and
surmounted. It signifies, therefore, the great force of liberation which
both drives into experience and brings experience to an end, from the
angle of humanity. This is the major stream of force in this particular
triangle at this time.
b. Mercury brings in that quick and intuitive mind which interprets
experience, fosters the growth of the intuition and relates the inner
spiritual man to the outer human being in such a way that their future
unity of purpose, plan and effort is assured. Mercury brings about those
changes in mental perception which eventually enable humanity to act
as the mediating interpreter between the higher worlds and the three
lower kingdoms in nature; thus Mercury institutes the threefold activity
of this centre in the body of the Heavenly Man which we struggle to
perceive and comprehend, and which we regard as forming the three
phases of the mind:
1. The abstract mind—pure manas.
2. The Son of Mind—soul, manasaputra.
3. The concrete mind—mental body.
and their correspondences in substance-energy:
1. The right eye.
2. The left eye.
3. The third eye. In this particular world cycle it is Capricorn which is producing the moment
of crisis—a crisis of initiation plus a crisis of destruction (related primarily to
the mineral kingdom) paralleled by a crisis of mental perception, [437]
precipitated by Mercury. It is this mental perception plus world participation
in the “crumbling of the mountain load of karma” which heralds the vision of
the new day from the top of the mountain.
Here in pictorial language I have endeavoured to indicate the three streams of
energy which meet in the centre called Humanity, involving therefore:
1. The active intelligence of man, latent in the human centre.
2. The initiatory activity of Capricorn.
3. The illumining radiance of Mercury.
This combination of energies produces a triplicity of activity of supreme
importance today.
Triangle Two has been called the “triangle of the advanced man”; it is
associated with the kingdom of souls, with the fifth kingdom in nature as it is
related to the fourth. It is this triplicity of forces which, playing on Triangle
Three, attracts out of it those units of energy which (as a result of the activity
of Capricorn, Mercury and Humanity itself) are ready to come under
hierarchical influence and to be swayed consequently by different streams of
force to those hitherto evoking response:
a. Pisces is particularly potent at present in the life of Humanity owing to
its being the sign which is now passing out of influence as we progress
upon the great wheel of the zodiac. It is this sign with its combination
of energies which has produced such a potent vibratory activity in
Humanity that it can successfully and eventually enact the role of World
Saviour. Of this salvation, Pisces is the sign. Pisces is also the sign of
[438] death, as you know, and in its death aspect we see the Piscean
correspondence to the first aspect, the destroyer aspect of the Logos.
This death aspect is naturally active at the close of the Piscean age and
is consequently bringing about the present death of form in all the three
worlds. b. Uranus is the planet of occultism for it veils “that which is essential; it
hides that which must be discovered and, at the right moment, it
transmits knowledge of the hidden mystery.” Today, for the mass of
men, occultism is non-existent; for the aspirant and the disciple
occultism is rapidly becoming a source and system of revelation as they
penetrate into the wisdom of the Hierarchy.
The triangle of Pisces-Uranus-Hierarchy is becoming magnetically
attractive to the triangle of Humanity. Uranus and Mercury in
combination are dualities which the disciple learns to resolve and in the
process of this resolution he shifts his focus out of the human kingdom
into the fifth kingdom, the Hierarchy of souls. Pisces and Capricorn in
unison bring about those changes which “lift the disciple out of the
waters, wherein he is rapidly drowning, on to the mountain top from
whence he can watch the recession of the waters. Thus does he know
himself initiate.”
The present world crisis should and will see a close merging of the two
triangles in a most potent manner and this partial synchronisation (for close
though it may be it will not yet be a process of general identification) will
produce the sixfold energy needed to bring in the new sixth race and the new
world period wherein fellowship and brotherhood will be manifest in all
human relations. [439]
Triangle One is produced by the inter-relation of energies from Leo, Saturn
and Shamballa. Its potency is naturally felt more directly in the triangle of the
Hierarchy than in that of Humanity. These three energies are sometimes called
(in an effort to make understanding more easy and to simplify
comprehension) the “triple energy of WILL”:
1. The will of self-determination—Leo.
2. The will of sacrifice—Pisces.
3. The will to choose—Capricorn.
because the Shamballa force lies behind the other two triangles and is the
recipient of energy from the three above constellations, blending them into the
united expression of will, and thus proves to be the custodian of divine purpose. The triangles of which the Hierarchy and Humanity are the
expression are becoming responsive to Shamballa—the hierarchical centre
greatly so and the human centre gradually so. This first or fundamental
triangle is occult in the truest sense of the word to even the trained occultist
and to the majority of the members of the Hierarchy. Therefore only a few
points can be mentioned in connection with it as there is little to be found in
even the advanced disciple with which to reach real understanding. The
information must perforce remain academic and theoretical.
a. Leo, which is the will of the self-conscious Entity to manifest, holds the
clue or key to the entire problem of self-conscious being, whether it is
the will-to-be of a planetary Logos, of a group or of a man. The selfconsciousness of man is inherent in the planet itself, which is the life
expression of a fully self-conscious Being. The use of the will through
the Shamballa centre [440] involves the conscious use of that energy by
the planetary Logos; this is evoking response today from the world of
men in terms of will, both higher and lower. The wilful (self-willed)
man of the world is apt to be more responsive to this Shamballa force
than is the disciple or the aspirant because they are more attuned to the
gentler vibration of the Hierarchy. I have earlier told you that this Leo
force from Shamballa is finding direct entry into the human centre
instead of indirectly via the Hierarchy as has hitherto been the case. The
implications of this are obvious.
b. Saturn. This energy is primarily concerned with presenting opportunity
to the Hierarchy and its affiliated disciples. The phrase that “Saturn is
the planet of discipleship” is basically true because ordinary average
man, except in group formation, does not come so potently under its
influence. For the Hierarchy—as a group—is facing a great crisis of
approach to Shamballa, analogous to that confronting Humanity today,
as it seeks approach and contact with the Hierarchy. Thus there are two
inter-related crises affecting both Humanity and the Hierarchy, and
these should produce—if correctly effected—that which is called
alignment or integration, resulting in a far freer inflow of divine energy.
Both these “approaches” (which are in the nature of magnetic attractive “pulls”) are conditioned by Saturn; in the case of Humanity this pull
comes via the Hierarchy and—apart from that Hierarchy—mankind
cannot today surmount or properly handle the crisis. This should be
remembered and should speed the work of the disciples and aspirants of
the world as they struggle for human liberation and to [441] bring about
divine intervention. The intervention desired should come via the
Hierarchy, if it is not to be too destructive in its effect. The last major
intervention in Atlantean days came via Shamballa and resulted in the
partial destruction of entire continents and lands.
These three triangles of energy can, therefore, be seen as basic and
determining in all planetary affairs and event-producing. I have consequently
chosen to consider them in our efforts to comprehend this basic astrological
science. 2. Triangles of Force—Planets.
At the same time, it will be obvious to you that, in relation to these simple
triangles, certain interlocking triangles also emerge, as for instance the
zodiacal triangle of Leo-Pisces-Capricorn and the allied planetary triangle of
Saturn-Uranus-Mercury . These two triangles pour their six streams of force
into our three planetary centres at this time, vitalising and stimulating the
planetary triangle of Shamballa-Hierarchy-Humanity . Behind these three
stands a cosmic triangle, emanating three streams of energy which pour into
and through the three lesser triangles, thus potently affecting every kingdom
in nature. This cosmic triangle is that of the Great Bear—Sirius—the Pleiades
. This paragraph simply summarises the preceding pages and indicates the
relation between four triangles of energy.
There are one or two subsidiary points which are of interest to the esoteric
astrologer and these we might briefly list in connection with these effective
triangles, using the word “effective” to imply conditioning and potent in
results. In this present world cycle all results are of unusual significance and
also unusually emphasised in human consciousness. [442]
1. Saturn, through which energy flows from Leo, via Shamballa, to
Humanity, governs two decanates in Capricorn. Hence its extreme potency today in the triangle of Humanity. Saturn breaks up existing
conditions by the force of its energy impact, thus enabling the influence
of Mercury to be more fully expressed. The vision can then be
intuitively perceived when obstructions have been removed.
2. Leo is one of the birth signs of the zodiac; it connotes the birth of selfconsciousness, as you know. Capricorn is also a birth sign, because it is
also an aspect or one of the arms of the Cardinal Cross—the Cross of
that which initiates or brings into being. This has a peculiar relation to
Humanity. It is the birth of the two types of consciousness—selfconsciousness and Christ consciousness—which are brought to the
attention of humanity by the fact of this Leo force, pouring through
Saturn to Humanity and thus bringing Shamballa and Humanity into a
closer relation, via Capricorn, active through Mercury.
At this point I would like to pause for a moment and interpolate a word in
answer to a perfectly normal question which is liable to arise in the minds of
thinking students and aspirants today. Of what use is all this abstruse and
abstract information to a world in agony and a world distressed? The major
usefulness of this imparted information which will condition the astrology of
the future lies far ahead in the period after the war when again the field of
world service opens and men have time for thought and due reflection. World
service is going on now perhaps in greater volume than ever before but it is
restricted to the field of releasing from slavery and alleviation of pain [443]
and suffering, and, therefore, to the more strictly physical forms of help. The
service to which I here refer is that educational process which will produce
the coming civilisation and its attendant culture. This will be based on all the
cultural processes of the past and of the present, but will discard all that has
produced the disasters of today, as far as may be possible. That means a
gradual future usefulness for the knowledge of the underlying potencies, for
they can indicate the lines of least resistance to the emerging good and the
developing crises which inevitably lie ahead in the period of reconstruction.
But one potent good can emerge even at this time from a study of these
matters, provided the student of esotericism rests not content with study
(using it as an escape from the disastrous present) but parallels his understanding of the causes and conditions by a strenuous effort to be of aid
in a practical and a definitely physical sense.
This is the dominant emerging fact to which all that I have said bears
testimony: world conditions today—precipitated as they are by human greed
and ignorance—are nevertheless basically conditioned by the will-to-good
which is the primary quality of the energies and forces coming forth from the
great Lives in which all that exist live and move and have their being. The
Law of the Universe (and what is law but the working out of the purposes of
these all-embracing Lives, of Their impulses and Their plans?) is to all
eternity the good of the whole and naught can arrest this happening; for who
can arrest the impact of these energies which play upon and through our
planet. When I say this, I would at the same time point out that the attitude of
many students, inevitably participants in world events, that “such is the Law
and such is the Karma of people and nations and such is the pre-determined
destiny” [444] is far from right. They believe—sometimes sincerely—that all
that should be done is simply to wait for results to appear and for karma and
destiny to fulfil itself. Then and not till then, all will be well. But they forget
that karma fulfils itself in relation to the form nature upon which it expends its
energy and that where there is a static condition and a quiescent attitude, the
process moves but slowly; the life then within the form fails to experience the
needed, forceful awakening; inevitably then there lies ahead a repetition of the
process until the time comes when activity and response is evoked. This then
leads to resistance to the apparent karmic necessity and this brings about
liberation . Only through resistance to evil (and in this world period and in
this kali-yuga, as the Eastern teachers call it, it is an essential basic attitude)
can karma be brought to an end. The law of matter still governs in the three
worlds of human experience and “fire by friction” must burn up that which
veils the steadily increasing brilliance of solar fire. It is the recognition of
“solar fire”—as it shows itself in a transcendental idealism and radiance—by
the unintelligent idealist, and his simultaneous refusal to cooperate in this
period of karmic necessity, that is prolonging the difficult and cruel situation
and leading him individually to sink deep into glamour. The simplification of
the world’s problem in terms of matter comes through a recognition of the essential dualism underlying events. I commend this thought to all students,
suggesting that they base optimism on the long range vision, endorsed by the
Heavens and corroborated by the activity of the stars, and thus feel sure of the
ending of this immediate tragic situation.
It is interesting to note that the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Law and Order
works through Uranus which is today the transmitter of Sirian force via Pisces
to the Hierarchy. [445] From that “middle centre” it passes to that sensitive
band of disciples, aspirants and workers to whose hearts and hands is
committed the heavy task, incident to the re-organisation and the rebuilding of
the shattered world structure. The seventh ray has sometimes been called a
peculiar name by Knowers. It is regarded as the “Ray of Ritualistic Decency.”
It aids and inaugurates the appearing of a new world order, based on a
spiritual drive and on aspiration, mental freedom, loving understanding and a
physical plane rhythm which provides opportunity for full creative
expression. To bring this about, energy from Shamballa (embodying the willto-good) is fused and blended with the organising energy of the seventh ray
and then carried to humanity along the stream of love which emanates from
the Hierarchy itself. Pisces governs this effort of the Hierarchy because the
highest aspect of Pisces which humanity can at this time in any way
comprehend is that of Mediatorship. This is the energy of mediation, of right
relationship. Today as never before the Hierarchy stands as a “mediating
transmitter” between:
1. Humanity and the will of God. The revelation of the true significance
and purpose of that will as it stands behind all world events is needed
now as never before. This can come through a closer relation between
the Hierarchy and Humanity.
2. Humanity and its karma, for it is equally essential that the laws for the
transmutation of karma into active present good are clearly grasped.
3. Humanity and cosmic evil, focussed for many millenia of years in what
has been called the Black Lodge. Speculation anent this Lodge and its
activities is both fruitless and dangerous. [446] The latter fact is responsible for the widespread attack made upon
Masonry during this century. Masonry—inadequate and corrupt as it has been
and guilty of over-emphasising certain forms of symbols—is nevertheless a
germ or seed of future hierarchical effort when that effort is—at some later
date—externalised on Earth. Masonry is governed by the seventh ray, and
when certain important changes have been made and the spirit of Masonry is
grasped instead of the letter, then we shall see a new form of hierarchical
endeavour appear to aid in the restoration of the ancient and sacred Mysteries
among men.
The energy of Uranus, pouring upon and into humanity, produces the urge to
better conditions to provide better forms for the occult and esoteric life and to
blend more adequately the inner and the outer man. This is one of the reasons
why the Moon is spoken of so often as veiling Uranus. The Moon is
frequently used as a blind when Uranus is meant. Today the Moon is a dead
world and the reason is that the Uranian urge became so strong in that far
distant time when there were living forms upon the Moon that it led to the
complete and final evacuation of the Moon and the transfer of its life to our
planet. Such a transfer is not necessary today as the consciousness of
humanity is such that the needed changes can be brought about without such a
drastic procedure. It is, however, this Uranian influence which lies behind the
present shift of populations throughout Europe and Great Britain and which is
responsible for the steady movement of peoples from East to West, from Asia
to Europe in the earlier history of that continent and from Europe to the
Western hemisphere in more modern times.
In the study of the interlocking of these triangles, it [447] it will become
apparent to the student that the combination of the influences of Sirius, Leo
and Uranus has been much needed at this time to foster and bring about those
conditions which will enable mankind, under the steady influence of the
Hierarchy, to take the first initiation and “give birth to the Christ,” thus
revealing and bringing to the light of day the inner, hidden, spiritual Man. It is
in Leo that man undergoes the preparatory stages of this first initiation. He
finds himself and becomes self-conscious; then he arrives at the stage of
intelligent discipleship; he formulates a conscious inner programme or purpose under the steady pressure of the life of the indwelling Christ; he
begins to exhaust and deny the demands and desires of the lower nature. This
cycle of experience is followed by a painful life of conscious re-orientation—
a cycle wherein he achieves balance and begins to “stand in spiritual Being”
as a result of constant trial and testing. Finally he stands ready for the ordeal
and the accolade of fire, preceding the first initiation . At that final stage,
Humanity today stands. When (as is now the case) the influence of Uranus is
added to the other influences and the seventh ray is at the same time entering
into a major cycle of activity on the Earth, there is then present the energy
needed to precipitate the crisis of initiation and produce a great rhythmic
awakening. Astrologers would find it of interest to note similar combinations
in the individual horoscope.
It must not be forgotten that Leo marks the height of achievement for the
human soul, and this is today stimulated by the Shamballa force now flowing
into the centre of humanity. This inflow will continue its critical work until in
the Aquarian Age, so rapidly coming into expression, the one-pointed attitude
of the Leo person (or shall I call it [448] the self-centredness?) becomes the
expanded consciousness and the decentralised attitude of the Aquarian man.
You can, therefore, see how full of promise is the future.
In the Aquarian Age, the power of the planet Venus becomes a dominant
factor in the last decanate. This I have already told you when we were
studying that sign. Upon the reversed wheel in the case of the spiritually
oriented man and the disciple, it is the first decanate under whose influence he
comes which is governed by Venus; this should be remembered. Venus was
the planet which we are told was responsible for the appearance of the
individualised consciousness in man—this in combination with other
influences and forces. In the Aquarian Age, Venus will again have an
analogous influence only with this difference that the emergence into
manifestation of an increased individualism and self-conscious realisation will
be subordinate to the appearance of the first stages of an expanded
consciousness throughout all mankind—the consciousness of group
responsibility. It will be perhaps better expressed as a form of group
individualism. Therefore: behind all these events, the dim outline of a lesser triangle of
energy can be seen; this is a blend of the energy of three planets: These produce a combination of the energies of
Ray 3.—Active intelligence.
Ray 7.—Ceremonial order or magic.
Ray 5.—Concrete mind.
[449] It can be noted how this combination of energies when playing upon
Germany’s soul Ray of Harmony through Conflict and her first ray
personality, on the Ray of Power and the Destroyer (responsive to Shamballa)
is responsible for much of the present conflict, for the reason that the reaction
of that country (under the influence of its present rulers) has been in terms of
the material aspect and not of the spiritual.
Students would find it useful to re-read some of the foregoing instruction
anent the signs Leo-Pisces-Capricorn, so as to familiarise themselves with the
nature, quality and influences which this great triangle (see page 435)
expresses and through which humanity is being led at this time forward along
the path of return. In this connection it is well also to remember that the series
of triangles with which we have been dealing refer to and produce changes in
the human consciousness. Another series of triangles was also given (on page
416) involving the Great Bear, Sirius and the Pleiades. These triangles concern the spiritual aspect of the planetary life and of humanity, as well as of
the other kingdoms in nature. Humanity is of peculiar importance in relation
to these triangles because it is the destiny of humanity to transmit life to the
subhuman kingdoms. With these triangles of supernal forces I shall not deal
because conscious response to their influence will not be possible till the time
cycle of the third initiation arrives. I simply mention this influence so that you
will realise that there is no real contradiction or discrepancy. Still another
enumeration of the triangles of energy emanating from the three major
constellations are given earlier by me (on page 435) and this again is correct
and not a contradiction. In this group of three sets of triangles—making nine
all told—with their interlocking analogies and lesser triangular relationships
and with also their points of fusion, you have [450] held in a “mystery of
potencies” the entire story—past, present and future—of human evolution. It
accounts for the changing emphases of that story, its shifting kaleidoscopic
pattern, its recurrent points of fusion and its steady progress, through
changing process, towards an ultimate revelation.
Very briefly I would like to touch upon the fact that, as might be expected, the
influences of Leo-Pisces-Capricorn which dominate the present world
situation, via Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity, are potent in their oft
unrealised effect upon the individual people. They bring about changes in his
life focus and in his centres just as they have wrought corresponding changes
in the three planetary centres. In view of this certain basic ideas can here be
emphasised:
1. The influence of Capricorn, via Mercury, will have a dominant effect in
the human kingdom—itself a planetary centre.
2. The individual disciple will, therefore, respond to this Capricornian
influence most easily. It will constitute a line of least resistance,
offering opportunity, as well as the chance of possible disaster if
wrongly handled. Right response will lead the disciple nearer to the
door of initiation; wrong response will take him back into the depths of
crystallisation and of concretion.
3. Disciples who respond to the influences above mentioned will
necessarily be largely conditioned by their rays, egoic and personal. First ray disciples will, for instance, respond to the Shamballa
influence, transmitted from Leo and Saturn, more easily than will
second ray disciples. These will in their turn react more rapidly and
consistently to the Hierarchy, transmitting energies from Pisces and
Uranus. [451] Júpiter . The above facts will demonstrate the nature and quality of the response
of disciples on Rays 1. 3. 5. 7. and Rays 2. Júpiter . 6. and this must always be
borne in mind as being true of disciples, of all men and also of nations.
5. According to the response so will be the evocation of the activity of the
centres, or a centre. But—and this is a point of major importance—all
disciples must at this time seek to find their dominant reaction in a
planned response to the influence of the Hierarchy and the energies
transmitted by it. As a general rule, the impact of Shamballa force
(particularly in the case of a disciple on Rays 1. 3. 5. 7.) will be of a
personality nature. It is the stimulation of the heart centre with a
consequent control of the solar plexus centre which should be the
planned result. The heart must dominate the solar plexus by the
withdrawing of its energies to the heart.
6. The time has not yet come when it is safe for the aspirant or the disciple
to relate the head centre and the base of the spine in response to a
definite and conscious appropriation of Shamballa force. Whatever may
take place automatically, normally and naturally and through the
development of the disciple can and should be permitted to take place,
provided there is no conscious intent and that there is also a close and
careful scrutiny and control of the personality life.
7. The awakening of the ajna centre with the consequent and subsequent
conscious control of the throat centre must inevitably take place
provided the disciple fulfils two conditions. He can then become
consciously, safely and correctly creative. These two conditions are:
a. A conscious orientation towards the soul and towards the
Hierarchy. [452]
b. A deep love for humanity, present and based on mental perception
and intuitive understanding and not on emotional reaction. 8. Where the above conditions are fulfilled, then the impact of the
inflowing energies will produce the required stimulation and
awakening.
This is all that I have to say about the response of the centres in the human
being to the activity of the planetary centres under systemic and zodiacal
stimulation. I am not here writing a treatise on the individual training of the
disciple but am attempting to demonstrate the fact of cosmic, zodiacal,
systemic, planetary and human interplay which in its turn constitutes a great
and living Whole—the life expression of a Being of Whom we only know
that love and the will-to-good, expressed through the Universal Mind, are the
outstanding characteristics and that these are steadily emerging into
increasing radiance. 3. The Triangles and the Centres.
It is necessary to remember that all influences which impinge upon the
individual or upon humanity as a whole pass through or are transmitted by
one or other of the planetary centres. I have said little about these centres save
to refer to the major three centres which we call Shamballa, Hierarchy and
Humanity. We recognise them as:
I.
Shamballa. . Gêmeos . Hierarchy. .
III. Humanity. . Power. Purpose . .
Love. Wisdom . . .
Intelligence . . . . . Planetary head centre . .
Planetary heart centre . .
Planetary ajna centre . . . Directing Will
Directed Love
Directed Mind Four other centres remain to be considered: the planetary throat centre, solar
plexus, sacral centre and the centre at the base of the spine.
[453] In the planetary logoic life—as is the case also with individual man, the
microcosm of the Macrocosm—certain centres are more awakened than
others and vibrate in unison with systemic impulse more fully than others. In
the case of the planetary Logos of our little sphere, the head centre, the ajna
centre, the heart and solar plexus centres and the throat centre are the five
focal points of energy which are the most alive and vibrant. The sacral centre
is slowly dropping below the threshold of the logoic consciousness whilst the
centre at the base of the spine is practically entirely quiescent, except in connection with its pranic effects upon the form life, engendering the will to
live, the urge to survival and the vitalisation of forms. These facts will give
you an idea of our planetary status in the great family of the central sun and
indicate why our planet is not a sacred planet. No planet is a sacred planet
unless the centre at the base of the spine (speaking symbolically) is aroused
and the great fusion of energies resulting therefrom has been effected. I refer
to this particular world cycle and period and to the state of affairs in this the
fifth or Aryan root-race. Students of my books and of The Secret Doctrine
must remember that any contradictions which may appear are only
contradictions in Time and that when this time factor is properly understood
and the student knows to what specific cycle the information should be
applied, these apparent inexactitudes will disappear.
What is true of humanity, for instance, during the third root-race, may not be
true in the fifth root-race. Therefore, all that can be done is to study and relate,
to reflect and to apply the Law of Analogy, knowing that when the expanded
and more inclusive consciousness of the trained initiate takes the place of the
present human awareness, [454] then these debated points will be clarified;
they will assume a true consistency and the contradictions will disappear.
The planetary centre which corresponds to the one at the base of the spine in
the human being will not be awakened until the seventh root-race and that
only when right relationship is established between the planetary sacral centre
(which is related to the third kingdom in nature, the animal kingdom) and the
planetary throat centre, functioning properly and in unison.
In the first volume of this treatise, certain hints were given anent the planetary
centres and the rays of energy pouring through them. To these I would like
here to refer because they are related to the Science of the Triangles. You
should note that the three lower kingdoms in nature constitute in themselves a
triangle of force and are essentially a reflection of a particular planetary
triangle. It might be of service if I here briefly tabulated again for you certain
of these major inferences—for they are little more than inferences at this time.
One point is of real interest here. I have stated that Humanity is the
correspondence in the planetary Life to the ajna centre in individual man. Earlier I told you that the fifth Ray of Concrete Knowledge is related to the
ajna centre and, therefore, in this present world cycle, you have:
Humanity. .planetary ajna centre. .5th Ray of Knowledge. .5th root-race.
Therefore five centres in man are rapidly awakening. These relationships
prove each other but only when seen in relation to the greater cycle. Humanity
was at one time the correspondence to the planetary solar plexus and some
day will shift the focus of its receptivity to the planetary heart centre; when
this takes place, the Hierarchy will [455] shift its focus of receptivity into the
sphere of influence of Shamballa. Of this shift, the presence of the twelvepetalled lotus in the highest head centre (the relating point between the heart
centre and the soul on its own plane) is the guarantee. The following relations
must consequently be borne in mind:
I. Head centre . . Shamballa . . 1st ray . . 1st & 7th races . .Will; the goal.
Energy of Life. Synthesis.
Seven centres awakened and functioning.
In first root-race alive and faintly vibrating.
In seventh root-race fully awakened. Gêmeos . Heart centre . .Hierarchy . . 2nd ray . . 6th root-race . . Love; the goal.
Energy of Identification. Achievement of fusion.
Six centres functioning.
The focal point of the egoic consciousness of divinity.
The fifth kingdom. The Kingdom of God.
III. Ajna centre . Humanity . 5th ray . 5th root-race . Intuition; the goal.
The energy of Initiation. Development of inclusiveness.
Five centres rapidly awakening.
The focal point of personality.
The human kingdom, the fourth kingdom in nature.
IV. Throat centre . . Animal . . 3rd ray . 3rd root-race . Intellect; the goal.
The energy of Illumination. Creating in the light. Four centres functioning.
Focal point of the instinctual consciousness.
The third kingdom in nature. [456]
V. Solar plexus . . Vegetable . . 6th ray . 4th root-race . Instinct; the goal.
The energy of Aspiration. Unfoldment of sensitivity.
Three centres functioning.
Focal point of psychic response.
The second kingdom in nature.
VI. Sacral centre .Deva evolution . .7th ray . 2nd root-race . Responsiveness;
the goal.
The energy of Magnetism. Power to build.
Two centres functioning; heart and sacral centres.
Focal point of vibratory response to the “eye of God.”
VII. Base of spine . Mineral . 4th ray .7th root-race . .Synthesis; the goal.
The energy of foundational Synthesis. Completion.
All centres functioning as one.
Focal point of evolution.
The first kingdom in nature.
This tabulation may serve to make a little clearer the present general plan or
blueprint of the evolutionary development of consciousness. Other
developments are proceeding simultaneously, such as the responsive
unfoldment of the form aspect and the evolution of the deva, or angel, line
which parallels the human and to which I referred in A Treatise on Cosmic
Fire . A third great scheme of evolution is proceeding and that can only be
referred to as the unfoldment of divine purpose on its own plane; of this
humanity has, as yet, no faintest conception because its consciousness is still
held within the limitations of its own kingdom in nature; the Hierarchy is
attempting to become responsive to this form of energy. [457] There is another point of interest to which I wish to refer and it is one
which is little realised by the average occult student. I refer to the outlets of
planetary energy through the means of which great and general effects are
produced in the external, planetary life. In this fifth root-race, there are only
five such outlets as far as effects on humanity are concerned; man’s
responsiveness to them, is demonstrated by the fact of their relative
importance in conditioning world events and world affairs. Wherever one of
these outlets for spiritual force is found, there will also be found a city of
spiritual importance in the same location. These five points are:
1. London.—For the British Empire.
2. New York.—For the Western Hemisphere.
3. Geneva.—For all of Europe, including the U.S.S.R. Júpiter . Tokyo.—For the far East.
5. Darjeeling.—For all of central Asia and India.
Later, two more points or outlets for energy will be added to these but the
time is not yet. Through these five places and areas in their neighbourhood,
the energy of five rays pours forth, conditioning the world of men, leading to
effects of planetary significance and determining the trend of events. A study
of history and of current affairs will produce some understanding of their
importance in connection with four of them. The effect of the force flowing
through the Darjeeling centre is not so immediately apparent but it is of major
importance as a distributing agency for the Hierarchy and particularly for
those Members of the Hierarchy who are dealing with and influencing current
human affairs in this time of momentous crisis.
These five points of conditioning energy produce two triangles of force in
their interrelation: [458]
1. London—New York—Darjeeling.
2. Tokyo—New York—Geneva.
Geneva and Darjeeling are two centres through which pure spiritual energy
can be directed with more facility than through the other three and they,
therefore, constitute the higher points of their respective triangles. They are more subjective in their influence than are London, New York or Tokyo.
Together, they form five centres of ‘impelling’ energy today.
It may interest you also to know the governing rays and astrological signs of
these five places, so far as they can be given at this time and during this
present cycle. Forget not that the personality rays change from period to
period in connection with countries and cities just as they do with individuals:

Scorpio. If students will study this information in connection with that given elsewhere
in connection with other nations and cities, the inter-relations now emerging
in world affairs will be seen as the result of the play of these forces and
energies and, therefore, unavoidable. The use of the energy may be along
wrong lines, producing separation and trouble, or along right lines, leading to
eventual harmony and understanding, but the energy is there and must make
its effects in any case. As in the individual life, the results of the play of the
life of the soul upon the form aspect, one or other of the rays will dominate
and control. If the person or nation [459] is spiritually oriented, the result of
the energy impact will be good and will lead toward the working out of the
divine plan and thus be wholly constructive. Where personality force
dominates, the effects will be destructive and hindering to the emergence of
divine purpose. Nevertheless, even destructive force can and does finally
work towards good, for the trend of the evolutionary force is unalterable. It
can be slowed down or speeded up according to the purpose, aspiration and
orientation of the entity (human or national); it can express soul purpose or
personality selfishness, but the urge towards betterment will inevitably
triumph.
In the study of this Science of Triangles, the student must bear in mind that
there is always one point of the triangle which—in a particular crisis or “event in consciousness”—is the emanating, dynamic, conditioning energy. During
the cycle (great or small, major or minor) in which it thus controls, the other
two points express receptivity and are regarded esoterically as embodying
forces. Every triangle is, therefore, the expression of one fundamental energy
and of two secondary forces. This is a basic statement of importance and the
formulation of a law under which all the triplicities of energy function in time
and space. You have consequently:
1. An emanating energy centre.
Dynamic expression of cyclic purpose.
Positive qualified out-going ray energy.
Planetary, systemic, zodiacal and cosmic energy.
The basis of hylozoistic (living) expression.
2. A receptive force centre.
An evocative expression of the initial impelling energy. [460]
A synthesis of two forces, the emanating and the receptive.
A qualified, conditioning secondary energy.
Motivating, blended energy, neither positive nor negative.
3. A responsive point of negative energy.
A major centre, completing the grounding of the emanating energy.
Responsive mainly to the second point of the triangle.
Source of a violent interplay between the two points of the base line. This distributing centre can be a solar system, regarded as a cosmic centre, a
planet, which is a systemic centre, one of the planetary centres, above referred
to, a nation or an individual or one of the centres in the human etheric body.
A close study of these energy streams will demonstrate two major
movements:
I. A downflow of energy from an emanating centre. This leads to
1. Its merging with the energy of a centre of reception and its consequent
qualification. [461]
2. Its transmission to and its evocative effect upon a second point or focal
point of reception.
Note: This leaves one side of the triangle as yet uncompleted.
3. The three types of energy (or rather one energy and two forces) proceed
then with the following activities:
a. Evocative energising of a secondary triangle.
b. Pouring down one side of this reflected triangle into the evoked
expression on the physical plane.
c. Producing manifestation, quality and activity.
d. Forming a reservoir of descending and balancing energies.
Some light on this most abstruse subject can be gained if the student will
attempt to realise that the above diagram and subsequent statement describes
his own involutionary and evolutionary history. It depicts the interplay of his
monadic life, soul energy and personality force, as these three focus on the
physical plane, producing manifestation and appearance. Gêmeos . A return flow of this qualified energy to its emanating source or the highest
point of the major triangle. This produces:
1. The completion of the two triangles—the Real and the unreal. The
building of the antahkarana is an aspect of this completion. This
concerns the final building of the later stages of the antahkarana by the
initiate. [462] 2. The transmission of force from the reflected or secondary triangle in the
three worlds of human endeavour (or in the five worlds in the case of
the evolution of members of the Hierarchy) is into the same focal point
on the base line of the higher triangle which received the original
emanating energy.
3. There are consequently two points of major importance in the higher
triangle:
a. The emanating point of positive conditioning energy.
b. The point which receives into itself both the higher energy and the
lower forces. This point is called the soul aspect of the triangle and is
always the registering agent of consciousness. It is, therefore, the
producer of crises, because the point where several energies meet is
the source of crisis in the outer life.
c. These crises are crises of initiation and this is true of men as
individuals, of nations and of humanity as a whole.
d. The overshadowing triangle is the factor which produces by its flow
into and out of the secondary triangle the “moments in time and the
events in space which lead to those episodes in the life of the soul
wherein force becomes energy and energy becomes life.”
Such a momentous event or crisis is now taking place in the life of
humanity today.
More along this line I may not here dictate. The subject is too vast, abstruse
and complicated. I have, however, [463] indicated enough to throw some
light upon this intricate science. Summarising what I have said:
1. Emanating, evocative and magnetic energies are the three types of
energy, flowing from the “superior triangle.”
2. Receptive, distributing and critical force are the three types of energy
distributed by the “inferior or reflected triangle.”
3. Two points of energy are shared by both triangles along the base line.
When the work is completed, the base line is formed by two blended
streams of energy, which embody the energies of both triangles. Júpiter . One point of energy (the magnetic point) produces involution and
outgoing during the process of forming the lower triangle. In a later
stage it—as a blend of energies—induces return of all the energies to
the emanating source.
At the same time, students must bear in mind that—owing to the Great
Illusion—it may appear to them that the triangles are incomplete during the
evolutionary process. The fact, however, is that in the Eternal Now all three
sides of the triangles eternally exist and persist. The problem is found only in
the consciousness of the subject but not in the Reality.
5. It must be noted by the student that:
a. The masses of men express down-pouring energy from the magnetic
centre . Their rightful trend is at present downward into physical
manifestation and experience. [464]
b. Aspirants and probationers express responsiveness to the pull of the
evocative centre . Their urge is towards the path of return.
c. Accepted disciples and initiates express the interplay along the base line
between the evocative and magnetic points.
d. Higher initiates and Masters utilise and express the energy blended in
the magnetic centre. They are returning or responding to the emanating
centre .
Thus the sixfold triangle—objective and subjective—is completed.
It will be of course obvious to you that it will not be possible to deal with all
the various triangles of energy which are effective on our Earth, and which,
incidentally, affect humanity exhaustively. Their name is legion. But certain
triangular relationships can be tentatively considered and their place in the
planetary or in the individual horoscope can then be later worked out. In the
new astrology which will be that of the soul, the paramount consideration of
the twelve houses (which are now of such importance) will be less
emphasised and the consideration of the three Crosses will emerge in their
place. These three Crosses make together twelve arms and it is the energy
flowing through the twelve arms and their place in the soul horoscope which
will assume the major importance. This I will enlarge upon when we take up the theme of the three Crosses. The twelve houses concern the personality.
The four arms of the three Crosses concern the soul and it is these twelve and
their appearance in the horoscope or their failure to appear which will govern
the horoscope of the soul. All the four influences of the three [465] Crosses
will be found present in the chart of a Master. Therefore an indication of
which constellations are primarily related to the unfoldment of consciousness
and to the evolution of spiritual understanding is of significant use here.
The major cosmic Triangle works primarily through six constellations at this
time and—again at this time—the cosmic constellation and the two zodiacal
energies focus through a particular planet, using it as a transmitting agency to
the Earth. You have therefore: These six influences aid greatly in the development of self-consciousness and
later of the spiritual consciousness in the man who has succeeded in reaching
the point of re-orientation upon the Great Wheel. I deal not here with the
personality influences, inclinations and determinations as they appear in the
chart of the ordinary man. I deal with the influences and with those
determining energies which pour upon the man who is on the Path of Return
to the centre of his life and, therefore, with the final three stages upon the Path
of evolution.
[466] We might consequently state that the forces of: 1. Cancer—Capricorn—Saturn (which are an expression of Sirian energy)
enable the aspirant to tread the Path of Purification, of Probation. These
energies focus and qualify the energy of the Great Lodge of the Most High in
that distant Sun. They pour through the Hierarchy upon the mass of men and
enable the unit in that mass to “isolate himself and turn his back upon the past
and find his way on to that section of the Path wherein he learns to feel .”
2. Gemini—Sagittarius—Mercury (which are an expression of the Pleiades)
enable the Probationary Disciple to pass on to the Path of Accepted
Discipleship. He is then becoming increasingly intuitive and entirely onepointed whilst the nature of the pairs of opposites is clearer to him. The
relation of the Mother-aspect (as embodied in the Pleiades) and of the Christchild, hidden within the form of the personality, is realised and the inner,
spiritual man institutes the process of initial identification with the spiritual
entity on its own plane; the little self begins to react consciously and with
increasing frequency to the higher Self. The man “presses forward on that
Path wherein he learns to see .”
3. Aries—Libra—The Sun (which are an expression of the Great Bear) bring
about that focussing of energy in the life of the disciple which makes it
possible for him to function consciously and with intention upon the Path of
Initiation. He enters the realm of the formless worlds because Aries, the sign
of beginnings makes this possible; through the potency of Libra, he has
succeeded in achieving that point of balance which makes the final escape
from the pairs of opposites possible. He now [467] knows, through
transcended feeling and from identification with the seen Vision, the true
meaning of being .
This threefold process can also be covered by the three words: Sensitivity,
Illumination and Inspiration.
Another group of energies can be touched upon though any true elucidation is
not possible. They concern the focussed energies of the seven solar systems of
which ours is one. These energies (six in number) reach our solar system, via
the constellations Taurus and Scorpio and the planet Mars. Their peculiar nature, objective in evolution and basic purpose is only
revealed to initiates above the fifth initiation. They are concerned with the
problem of desire (which is to humanity a problem but not in its higher
octaves) and with its transmutation into spiritual will and divine purpose.
They are the originators of conflict, are closely connected with the fourth Ray
of Harmony through Conflict and are, therefore, in a peculiar relation to the
fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human, and to our Earth in this fourth round.
In these eight constellations are to be found the influences which are mainly
concerned with the evolution of the soul—in the solar system, in the planet
Earth and in man. They are the “eight potencies of the Christ”; they govern
the psychic unfoldment of the life in all forms. They are of the utmost
significance to the aspirant.
[468] Four constellations have been omitted from this list:
Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . . Virgo . . . . . . . . . .
Aquarius . . . . . . . .
Pisces
Self-consciousness. Christ consciousness . . . Group consciousness . . . . Universal consciousness They are basically concerned with the expression of consciousness on the
outer external planes of expression or with the fusion of soul and form in
order to demonstrate fully a state of awareness. These facts will become
apparent if the four esoteric planets connected with these four constellations
are considered and related:
The Sun . . . . . . The Moon . . . . . Jupiter . . . . . . . . . . . . Pluto The Soul . . . . . . The Form . . . . . Beneficent Life . . . . . Death It will also be apparent to the astrologer of the future along which lines the
chart of the soul must be drawn; the major triangles and the three cosmic
Crosses will control his deductions as to the unfoldment of consciousness.
The triangles indicate possibility; the Crosses indicate process and points of
crisis. There is, as I have said, no way of handling this Science of Triangles at length
or exhaustively, for it is the science of the universal geometrical blueprint
underlying the phenomenal worlds and is also closely related to Karma. It
concerns the first precipitation of the interaction and the effect of the duality
of manifestation, of spirit-matter, as they constitute one substance. But, in its
relation to esoteric astrology, it is possible to indicate certain fundamental
interpretations of this relation which will enable the astrologer to work out
eventually the astrology of the soul , to outline the horoscope of the ego and
to draw up the new types of charts which will demonstrate soul purpose on its
own plane and group relations also on the physical plane and [469] so be of
aid to the intelligent, dedicated personality. Ponder on this.
There is one triad of cosmic energy that is of supreme importance upon our
planet and it is the united influence of its three constellations which will
eventually bring about the initiation of the planetary Logos; this will warrant
any future planetary expression of His life to be termed a “sacred planet.” At
present our Earth is not regarded as a sacred planet. Later, when these three
energies have produced adequate effect and the needed planetary changes
have been produced, the term “sacred” will be deemed correct and
appropriate. This statement of course means little to any student at this time.
When, however, he is able factually to realise two things, the case will be
different. These are:
First, that the threefold energies which lie back of the activity of the centre
at Shamballa concern the planetary Logos; humanity is slowly
becoming sensitive to that influence, but only in mass formation and
not individually. Only theoretically can a disciple take note of this fact.
Second, these influences are playing upon that aspect of human life which
we call the Monad; they will, therefore, have a steadily increasing
effect upon the Path of Initiation.
These three constellations are Leo—Virgo—Pisces. They are spoken of
esoterically as “the Producers of that which knows, the Informers of that
which is awakened and the Constructors of the modes of fusing Wisdom.
They produce a unity; They shatter that which They have produced only again to produce it in greater beauty and in wider fullness.” These words are clear.
This triangle is, at this [470] time, an inverted one with the Leo energies in
the closest contact with our planetary life. The following triangle will show
this more clearly. These three are connected definitely and increasingly with the unfoldment of
human consciousness in three main aspects.
There is the development of self-consciousness to be fostered and this is the
major effect—as well you know—of the force of Leo. The influence of this
constellation aids in the manifestation of individual will, individual love, and
individual intelligence; it fosters the “ahamkara” or egoistic principle; it
produces the emphasis upon the “I am” attitude which is so necessary a stage
before the individual can merge himself as a conscious Self-respecting unit in
the Whole. But behind this influence and pressing through into manifestation
is the force of Virgo (the mother or custodian of the Christ-consciousness)
which shatters eventually the synthesis and the lower unity already produced
by the Leo energy; it stimulates the soul within the form as well as the soul
within each atom in the form, because the genius and uniqueness of Virgo is
that it produces the form as well as stimulates the life within that form and,
therefore, nourishes and energises two lives simultaneously. It is a powerful
dual energy, a potent expression of the anima mundi or the soul of the world.
It was the recognition of [471] this which made the ancient astrologers merge Virgo-Leo into one sign. Then as the dualism of the human spirit (spiritmatter) became a fact in the consciousness of man, the sign was divided into
two signs and the war of the pairs of opposites became a “war with purpose”
and is, incidentally, reaching its climax today. This fact will be obvious to all
true esotericists.
Another stream of energy is also pushing through and producing effects upon
those in the human family who not only respond to the Leo force and are
consequently individuals in their own consciousness but are responding also
to the steadily expanding Christ-consciousness; of this they are becoming
increasingly aware in their own individual experience. This is the higher
aspect of the energy of Pisces; it is awareness of the group, of the whole and
of the universe. It is the energy of buddhi, the higher aspect of the lower
psychic nature; it is the aspect of the mediator in contradistinction to the
medium. It is intuitional control instead of the intellectual overlordship of Leo
and the limitations of Virgo.
These three energies are today playing potently on humanity, producing:
1. The self-consciousness of man, as he emerges out of the mass.
2. The recognition of the Christ life and nature, as the aspirant for the first
initiation emerges out of the group of world individuals.
3. The awareness, universal in nature, of the initiate, as he emerges out of
the ranks of the world disciples.
All this is, therefore, brought about at this time by the steady inflow of the
energies of Leo-Pisces-Virgo and these lie behind the very rapid unfoldment
of the three types of [472] consciousness to be found in varying degrees in
humanity today.
There are, as I pointed out earlier, seven great crises in connection with the
human being upon the path of evolution; they cover the earlier, the later and
the final stages of his growth. These it should be borne in mind are
precipitated through the conditioning influences of seven great constellations.
Let us consider them for a moment. They are:

Fixed You will note that two of the constellations which we have just been
considering—Leo and Virgo—are to be found in this list. Five constellations
are not so intimately concerned with the mass human crises but are more
definitely and specifically related to the unfoldment of the individual disciple.
These are: Sagittarius, Libra, Taurus, Pisces and Aquarius. Pisces has,
however, at this time a unique relation to the seven constellations which
produce the great human crises; it also completes the final united effort of the
Triangle: Leo, Virgo, Pisces. It has been the steady impact of Piscean force
which has at long last brought humanity, the world disciple, to the very door
of initiation. For over two thousand years, Piscean influence has been playing
upon mankind; it has brought about the demand for world adjustment; it has
developed the international spirit and has led to the formation of groups in
every department [473] of human living and so laid the foundation for the
future synthesis in Aquarius. The influence of this triangle finds symbolic
expression in the life of the self-conscious individual who reaches selfawareness in Leo; in the culturing care of Virgo and the final self-release in
Pisces.
We might here give a little time to the practical lessons to be learnt from the
seven crises through which man, the individual, and humanity, the larger
whole, must pass.
In considering these crises which take place in the life history of the soul from
its first incarnation until its final release, it will be found that seven major
constellations and their influences, pouring through the exoteric and the
esoteric planets, stage the circumstances and condition the environment of the
onward-moving, spiritual man. Certain lives will occur when one or other of these constellations will exert a predominant influence. They will produce
that focussing of forces which—given a man’s particular equipment at any
point in time—will evoke from him the maximum of possible effort, thus
enabling him to move forward into a more enlightened state of consciousness.
You will note, that I do not say “enable him to be victorious.” A man may
succeed in surmounting the testing conditions and in emerging conqueror over
circumstances upon the physical plane and yet be defeated. The reason for
this is that unless the struggle and the emergence produce basic changes in
consciousness and a greatly extended horizon, they will prove futile to
accomplish their intended task.
In studying the moments of crisis, it must be remembered that they are passed
through approximately three times from the standpoint of the major life cycle
and are also recapitulated in a minor sense in some particular life or group of
lives. The three cycles of major import in the consciousness of the
reincarnating ego are: [474]
1. The evolutionary cycle from individualisation to liberation, from the
stage of primitive man to the emergence upon the stage of world affairs
of a Master of the Wisdom, a Buddha or a Christ.
2. The cycle of aspiration from the stage of intelligent integrated man to
that of the accepted disciple and from the experience of intellectual
expression in the three worlds to that of the probationer who is seeking
trial upon the Path and is beginning to take his spiritual unfoldment
consciously in hand.
3. The cycle of initiation from the preparatory stage of accepted disciple to
that of the Master and the still higher grades. These seven crises are
each re-enacted during the process of self-initiation into the world of
meaning and of reality. They constitute the keynote or the motif of each
of the seven initiations. Each of these seven initiations permits entry
into the state of divine consciousness on each of the seven planes of
divine experience and expression.
The influences of these seven constellations is symbolised by three
triangles and a final synthesis or focal point. Esoterically, these triangles are usually depicted as superimposed but for the sake of
clarity we separate them. [475] We have here three triangles but, at the same time, only seven
influences for the effects of the conditioning forces of the two triangles
predominantly active in the first two cycles are fused and blended in the third.
These blended influences (with the aid of the remaining five constellations,
Sagittarius, Libra, Taurus, Pisces and Aquarius) enable the disciple to escape
out of the human kingdom into the kingdom of souls. We have therefore:
1. Seven constellations
Cancer, Aries, Gemini, Scorpio, Capricorn, Virgo, Leo, which bring the
man from the stage of individualisation to the Path of Discipleship.
2. Eight constellations (which include three out of the seven) which bring
the disciple from the stage of selfhood to that of the self-initiated and
perfected soul.
It is not my intention to analyse these crises. These, the student who is in
earnest and who is observant can work out for himself.
I would also point out that I have (again necessarily) only depicted the three
triangles in a certain order with the lower points expressing the energy of
certain constellations. In this form they depict the final outcome and the final
results of a particular group of three crises . It must be remembered that only
through much repetition and frequent focussed effort are these results attained. A crisis is brought about by a certain habit of mind, developed in the
vehicle; it is surmounted in time only by a certain habit and rhythm of the
spiritual content of the man’s nature. It is the establishing of a certain
objective rhythm which produces a crisis; it is the emergence of a particular
subjective rhythm which enables a man to surmount the crisis and to capitalise
on the opportunity. Please bear this in mind.
[476] These seven crises can also be related to the seven centres in the vital or
etheric body, and advanced students will later find that there is a close cyclic
interrelation between:
1. The seven planes of divine expression.
2. The seven states of resultant consciousness.
3. The seven crises, leading to the expansion of consciousness. Júpiter . The seven initiations, climaxing these expansions.
5. The seven centres wherein these results are realised.
Let me remind students that all the twelve constellations bring about man’s
evolutionary development and eventual release from the Great Wheel of
living existence. Seven of these are, however, primarily useful in bringing
about the seven crises of the soul whilst five of them are instrumental upon
the final stages of the Way in enabling the disciple or initiate to utilise the
experience gained and the values grasped in effecting entrance into the fifth
kingdom in nature. You have, therefore, the 12 + 7 + 5, making 24 in all and
in these are to be found the “24 episodes which mark the Cross of Life.” From
the standpoint of Christian symbolism (even though the interpretation is as yet
inadequate) these seven crises correspond to the seven stations of the Cross
which mark the way of an advancing world Saviour.
In connection with the five constellations which are peculiarly active in the
life of the advanced disciple and initiate, the influences fall into two triangles
of force, because Leo—focussing the energy of the seven constellations—is
included, thus linking the self-conscious aspect with the spirit: [477] Shirk not these crises, hard and difficult though they may appear to be.
Difficult they are. Forget not that the habit of confronting crises is a longestablished one within the consciousness of humanity. Man has the “habit of
crisis,” if I may so call it. They are only the points of examination as to
strength, purpose, purity and motive and the intent of the soul. They evoke
confidence when surmounted and produce greatly expanded vision. They
foster compassion and understanding, for the pain and inner conflict they have
engendered is never forgotten, for they draw upon the resources of the heart.
They release the light of wisdom within the field of knowledge and the world
is thereby enriched. Júpiter . Conclusions.
We have reached a point in our consideration of the Science of Triangles
wherein we can pause for a minute to consider our next approach to this
subject and choose the theme by means of which we can throw more light
upon it. It should by now be obvious to you that this Science of Triangles
concerns the beneficence of Deity and that, through the intricate combinations
of cosmic, systemic and planetary triangles, the purposes of God are working
out. Those purposes are motivated by love. It is through these relationships
that love expresses itself, brings about the needed changes for that expression,
and human consciousness is brought into the required state of inclusiveness.
[478] It is through the squares or the quaternial relation that the form aspect is
brought into relation and adequacy to the will of Deity, expressing itself
through the gradually unfolding consciousness aspect. I am explaining this
situation in these simple words because it must be apparent to you that only as
the soul illumines the mind can the significance of the teaching be grasped. It
is only when the stage of initiation is reached that the true meaning will emerge. In the meantime, I have sought to awaken in your minds a reaction to
the abstract truth lying behind the two following statements:
1. The Science of Triangles is related to the total expression of the divine
triplicity of manifestation: will, love and intelligence or life,
consciousness and form. Until, therefore, the disciple can express in
himself the integrated resemblance to these three aspects, he will not be
able to grasp the meaning of this subjective astrological science.
2. On our planet, the Science of Triangles is related to the three major
aspects, as they express themselves through Shamballa, the Hierarchy
and Humanity. Again, therefore, we come up against the need for the
approach of the integrated human being to this science because only the
man who is responsive to these three focal points of energy can
understand the interplay. Only, in fact, can the man apprehend the
underlying truth whose two head centres and his heart centre form a
triangle of flowing energies.
In this connection, I would remind you of what I said earlier in the treatise
that the Science of Triangles is related to spirit and synthesis. I would remind
you also that what I have written in this astrological section of the Treatise on
[479] the Seven Rays is intended for the instruction of disciples at the close of
this century and during the post-war period. Again I would also point out that
I stated earlier that this science must always be approached from the angle of
the three basic energies: i.e., those coming from the Great Bear, from the
Pleiades and from Sirius; because (conditioned by time and space) these three
types of energy pour through the three major centres, Shamballa, the
Hierarchy and Humanity.
My problem has been to choose which of the myriad interlocking triangular
relationships I would take up with you and thus present this science in such a
manner that it would prove of real interest. The inner web of light which is
called the etheric body of the planet is essentially a web of triangles and when
the evolutionary process is completed, it will have been organised. At present
a pattern of squares is the major construction of the web but this is slowly
changing as the divine plan works out. The etheric webs of the sacred planets are largely triangles whilst that of the Sun is that of interlaced circles. The
effort on Earth today (as seen by the planetary Logos) is to bring about a
transformation of the web of the planet and thus slowly change the existing
squares into triangles. This is done by the creation of division, by the
application of the Law of Separation, but also by the recognition, in
consciousness, of duality, the application of directed motion and the
appearance of two triangles in the place of one square. When this has taken
place, the perceiving consciousness recognises identity and the rule of the
square is ended. These words were once spoken to me by an ancient seer who
bisected the square esoterically, thus forming two triangles and united them in
a fresh manifestation to form a Star of Life. Ponder on this.
[480] It is for this reason that the astrologers of the future will emphasise the
relation and the interrelation of triangles. The new astrologer will, as I have
hinted before, lay the emphasis upon:
1. The Science of Triangles, as the result of the growth of the initiate
understanding.
2. The rising sign, as it indicates the way of the soul.
3. The place of the three Crosses (the Cardinal Cross, the Fixed Cross and
the Mutable Cross) in the life of the soul. This will eventually
supersede the houses in the horoscope and the 12 arms of the three
crosses will take the place of the 12 houses when casting the horoscope
of the soul.
I would reiterate again the fact that the new astrology will be occupied with
the charting of the life of the soul. The 12 constellations, as they play their
part in the life of the disciple through the medium of their distributing agents,
the ruling esoteric planets, will gradually transform the exoteric form of the
chart of the individual. This will be due to the focussing of the various
energies in man, consciously and through intent, and will not concern his
negative reaction to the conditioning energies.
I would like here to call your attention to an interesting point which has a
definite bearing upon the power of the individual to grasp the new astrology
and to comprehend the Science of Triangles. The astrological symbols for Virgo and Scorpio are triple in nature—the only two which are. When the
disciple grasps the meaning behind this triplicity, he will be ready to grasp the
significance of this abstruse science and to work with the new astrology.
Virgo and Scorpio are two signs connected with the growth of the [481]
Christ consciousness; they mark critical points in the soul’s experience—
points of integration wherein the soul is consciously at-one-ing itself with the
form and at the same time with spirit. I said the soul’s experience , not the
experience of the man upon the physical plane. When the experience
undergone in Virgo is consummated in Pisces and the tests of Scorpio have
led to illumination in Taurus, then the effect of these four energies (Virgo,
Pisces, Scorpio, Taurus) will be to make man the true triangle, expressing the
three divine aspects or energies as they come from the three major
conditioning constellations: the Great Bear, the Pleiades and Sirius.
I could fill many volumes with the indications of the various triangles as they
are discovered to be related in time and space. Under the will of Deity and the
unalterable energy at the heart of the manifested zodiac, they produce the
changes in consciousness which make man divine at the close of the world
cycle. But the theme is too vast and all I seek to do is to point the way
towards a new science and towards those esoteric combinations of energies
which will, when recognised, enable humanity to make more rapid progress,
fuse and blend the energies of the three planetary centres and transform our
Earth (through the agency of human thought, reacting to zodiacal influences )
into a sacred planet. It is, therefore, the influence and combination of energies
as they affect the aspirants and disciples of the world which must suffice for
any increased understanding; with these I shall gradually deal and I shall also
in the final part of this section give you an exegesis of the tabulation. In that
tabulation is given the relation between the rays and the constellations and
this is basic in its implications.
Certain of the forces with which we are dealing govern [482] humanity in a
peculiar manner and the effect of their influence is to bring about the at-oneing of the three planetary centres. There are four constellations, as you know, which convey the required
energies which will make humanity divine. They are Aries, Leo, Scorpio and
Aquarius. I need not enter into an analysis of them as this was covered when
we studied each of them earlier and separately. I would, however, like to point
out that each of these constellations is closely connected, as a transmitter of
energy, with certain stars, lying outside our zodiac altogether, thus connecting
our tiny planet with certain great focal points of energy.
Aries, the initiator of impulses (either the impulse to incarnate or the impulse
to return to the originating source) is closely in touch with one of the stars in
the Great Bear to which we give the name “Pointer” in common parlance.
This Pointer is a “major star of direction” because through it (in this world
cycle) flows the will to unify and to bring about synthesis. This is the force
which brings about the fusion or integration of the personality, the at-onement of personality and soul, the unification of humanity or the Great
Approach of the Hierarchy to Humanity. It will produce also the integration of
our Earth into the body of the “sacred planets” and the consequent
establishing of a triangle of force composed of the Pointer, Aries and our
Earth. This triangular relationship will have a potent effect upon the solar
system as well as upon the planet itself and is also one of the factors
producing the shift in the Earth’s axis. Related to this triangle is a secondary
one within our sun’s orbit, composed of Vulcan, Pluto and the Earth. In the
Archives of the Great Lodge this is referred to symbolically as: [483] This is one of the most interesting and informing astrological symbols I have
given you and indicates a most momentous relationship. You have here two
major and three minor energies brought into close relation; this is analogous
to the two major rays and the three minor rays which condition a human being
in manifestation. These are the five energies which concern the informing life of our planet. They produce, in humanity, conscious evolution, direction and
the founding of Shamballa upon the Earth. They are the five energies
connected with the will-to-be, but from the consciousness angle and not the
material expression of manifestation. Their activity and united influence in
the realm of consciousness produced the appearance of another triangle: Leo,
Polaris and another of the Pointers and these two groups form an interlocking
directorate, potently effective in the evolution of consciousness.
You have, therefore, through these related triangles, the appearance of
Shamballa and Humanity—the two poles of divine expression—will and
activity.
We come now to another triangle, the activity of which produces the
manifestation of Hierarchy—the intermediary between Shamballa and
Humanity: Scorpio, Sirius and Mars. These, in relation to our Earth, produce
the four streams of energy (initiating and transmitting) which lead humanity
towards discipleship and initiation.
When the work of all these triangles has been concluded, [484] humanity
(and in a mysterious sense our Earth) will be functioning in perfect rhythm
and will respond to the energies pouring in from Alcyone.
I cannot too strongly repeat that esoteric astrology is entirely concerned with
the forces and energies which affect the consciousness aspect of the human
being, and condition the personality life. This is the point which must be
considered above all else. In other words, esoteric astrology is concerned with
the soul and not with the form and, therefore, all that I have to say refers to
consciousness, to its expansion, to its effect upon its vehicles, the form, and—
in the last analysis (as will be later established)—with the Science of
Initiation. This I have earlier pointed out, but the idea is so new and the
approach so universal or cosmic, that it is not easy for those trained in modern
exoteric astrology truly to comprehend the significance of this teaching. In
considering the Triangles, which I have chosen to use as the theme in
elucidating this immense subject, this emphasis upon the consciousness aspect
must not be forgotten. For the remainder of this section on the Science of Triangles, I shall take up
those triangles which are at this time and in this world cycle producing effects
in the human consciousness. These effects are of two kinds: those which are
general, not so easily discernible and which affect the masses of men, and
those which are more specific in their results, more tangibly effective and
which serve to condition the consciousness of the world aspirants, disciples
and initiates. Today, this dual movement of energies is going on, producing a
slow, steady awakening of the mass consciousness so that individual selfconsciousness on a large scale will be the result and the more rapid
stimulation of [485] the already awakened consciousness of advanced
humanity so that initiation will be achieved.
The effectiveness of this dual process can be seen if it is realised that three
great signs—Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius—are today exceedingly active and
working in close relation with each other. They are the three signs whose
energies are affecting humanity as a whole—as a kingdom in nature. Leo: the
sign of the self-conscious individual is potent in its mass effect and today,
through the stress of circumstance and the dire results of certain events,
thousands of men and women are stepping out of the ranks of the massconscious herd and out of the deep sleep of irresponsibility and becoming
aware of themselves as detached, functioning entities. Sagittarius is
powerfully affecting the world aspirants and leading them towards those
attitudes of mind which will produce an unswerving allegiance to the spiritual
values and an unalterable adherence to the good of humanity. Aquarius is—
with equal potency—affecting the world disciples and initiates, leading them
to world service on a large scale, producing group activity and that living
usefulness which is the hall-mark of the pledged disciple. The influence of
these three constellations is felt through their esoteric planets, and the mass
movement in consciousness (for which Leo is responsible) can be noted as
possible even by the novice when he realises that the ruling planets in Leo
are, from all three angles—exoteric, esoteric and hierarchical—the Sun. The
mass movement towards individual self-consciousness is today enormously
intensified as is the paralleling individual movement towards initiation. Leo appears again in another important triangle at this time: Aries, Leo, Virgo
—a triangle which potently aids in inaugurating the New Age. That New Age
will be distinguished [486] by a truly self-aware humanity, conditioned by a
steadily manifesting Christ consciousness. The potency of Aries, as it initiates
those happenings which will set in motion the causes that will produce the
New Age, can be seen today in the trend of all the new movements, in the
formulation of the various world orders, in the discoveries of science and in
the emergence of the new types in the different kingdoms in nature. This
activity has only been felt since 1835; the potency of Leo can be traced since
then in the vast number of people who are achieving the integration of the
personality and becoming self-conscious, as well as in the emergence of
thousands of self-conscious world aspirants who are subordinating gradually
their integrated personalities to the good of the group. The influence of Virgo
appears in the many religious, spiritual and mental organisations and
movements which indicate so directly the awakening of the Christ
consciousness in humanity. These triangles thus can be seen as vibrant living
factors, producing world changes and giving a tremendous push onward to
human unfoldment.
It is interesting to bear in mind that just as each sign is divided into three
decanates which are ruled by specific planets, so the zodiac itself is a part of a
still greater zodiac and is also divided into three parts. The three-fold division
of the zodiac is ruled by three constellations which are to this greater zodiac
what the planets are to the decanates. The three ruling constellations are
Scorpio (on the Fixed Cross), Taurus (also on the Fixed Cross), and Pisces (on
the Mutable Cross). This would necessarily be so because testing, trial, desire,
illumination, matter, form and salvation are the keynotes of our solar system
and of our Earth in particular. This solar system is a system which is
expressing the second aspect of divinity and hence the [487] emphasis upon
the forces pouring through Scorpio, Taurus and Pisces. Ponder on this. A hint
is there conveyed anent our zodiac which is of supreme importance to the
astrologer of the future. In the cosmic decanates to which I here refer, it will
be found that three great sons of God have expressed for us the quality, the
keynote and the development which is expressive of each decanate: Hercules—Scorpio.—Strength through testing.
Buddha—Taurus.—Illumination through struggle.
Christ—Pisces.—Resurrection through sacrifice.
In a peculiar sense, these three constitute a triangle of initiation and are of
paramount potency in the initiation process. They express strength,
illumination and love in full expression .
Leo appears again in this world situation as a part of a triangle of crisis , for
the combination of the three constellations involved invariably produces
crisis. These three are Leo, Libra and Capricorn. Leo, when dominating the
triangle, produced in the past the crisis of individualisation. Later in human
history, when the point of balance was reached, Leo was again potent. H. Plutão .B.
pointed out that there came a time when the balance was reached between
spirit and matter and from that time on the tendency of humanity was towards
evolution out of matter and not involution into matter; humanity turned
towards the Path of Return and not the Path of Outgoing; this has become
increasingly apparent. Today, Capricorn is producing a third crisis in the long,
long history of mankind—a crisis of initiation, and the possibility of this crisis
proving effective and producing the appearance of a new kingdom of nature
on Earth is steadily becoming more and more possible. I would like here to
remind you of an earlier reference [488] to still another triangle in which Leo
is active and to another of the great triangles conditioning humanity: Taurus,
Leo, Aquarius. Taurus incites towards experience and towards the gaining of
knowledge; Leo leads to the expression of that experience in daily life and to
the effort to justify knowledge; Aquarius takes that experience and the
knowledge gained thereby, and turns it to conscious use in the service of the
group. We might phrase it thus:
Taurus—in the final stage of development demonstrates as the illumined
consciousness.
Leo—produces the truly Self-conscious man.
Aquarius—is the man of spirit, of life, and of consecration to the divine
expression of service. It is here that the importance of the esoteric rulers can be seen. These
triangles, composed of three constellations are (according to cyclic law)
dominated at any one time by one of the three, the other two being
subordinated. These triangles are called in the Archives of the Lodge
“Triangles in Revolution”; at one time, one of the three constellations will be
the controlling factor; at another time another will swing into effectiveness
and later a third. Each of these in turn pours its force through its esoteric ruler
and the other two energies become of secondary importance. When this
information is connected with the teaching upon the rays, it will be apparent
how necessary it is to know which of the triangles is the focal point of
transmission, because in this way it will be discovered which ray energy is in
major or minor expression.
Leo, as we have seen, is for instance a most important transmitting agency in
the present world crisis. This means, therefore, that Rays I and V are
exceedingly active; it means, secondly, that the Sun’s influence is potent, both
[489] exoterically and esoterically. It means also that the planets which are
related to these two rays will be very active and, therefore, that Pluto and
Venus are dominant in producing world results. I cite this as an instance of the
interrelation of planets, constellations and rays; a close study of the world
crisis will indicate the plausibility of the premise as to the activity of Leo as a
major force in the triangle at present responsible for producing the world
situation.
Earlier in this treatise, I gave you the relation between the rays and the
constellations and stated that each of the seven rays expressed itself through
the medium of three constellations or through a triangle of energies. This
relation is the basis of the entire Science of Triangles and, therefore, of
astrology itself; it is also related to the rays, the constellations, their ruling
planets and our Earth in a great synthesis of energies; it relates our solar
system to the larger whole and our tiny non-sacred planet to the solar system.
Let me repeat that statement and thus indicate to you some vital facts anent
this world of interweaving energies. The Rays pour through, are expressed by
and are transmitted through the following constellations:

list some of them for you, leaving you to apply the information as may seem
best to you.
1. This interrelation is effective in this world cycle and will remain so until
the end of the Aquarian Age. By [490] this I mean, that these seven triangles
of energy are today pouring their force through one of the constellations in
each triangle.
2. Today, the following points of the triangles of energy or the following
constellations in the triangles are the controlling factors:
Ray I.—Aries: This constellation, as might be expected, is the source of
the initial energy, producing the New Age.
Ray Gêmeos .—Virgo: This constellation produces the increased activity of the
Christ principle in the heart of humanity.
Ray III.—Cancer: The mass movement towards liberty, release and light,
so dominant today, is caused by the energy of this sign.
Ray IV.—Scorpio: Through this constellation comes the testing of
humanity, the world disciple.
Ray V.—Leo: This sign produces the growth of individualism and of selfconsciousness, so prevalent today on a world scale.
Ray VI.—Sagittarius: This sign produces the focussed one-pointed effort
of the world aspirant.
Ray VII.—Capricorn: This Capricornian energy produces initiation and
the overcoming of materialism.
3. It will be noted in this tabulation that several of the constellations find
themselves in one or more of the triangles of energy, showing, therefore, that:
a. Ray IV is relatively inactive. [491] b. Ray VII like Ray I is active through all three points, even though Aries
is the most potent and active.
c. Ray VI as might be expected, is equally expressive and effective. Júpiter . Five of the constellations—Taurus, Gemini, Libra, Scorpio and Aquarius—
are only found in one of the various triangles.
a. Taurus (Ray IV) is not active exoterically as the fourth ray is not in
manifestation at this time.
b. Through Scorpio, Ray IV is focussing esoterically the work of the world
disciples, preparing them for initiation.
c. Gemini is only found in the triangle of Ray Gêmeos and at this time, Virgo and
Pisces are carrying the major task of transmitting second ray energy.
Today the world is focussed (spiritually or materially) and the
fluctuations of the pairs of opposites are much lessened temporarily.
Gemini, therefore, is the inactive point of the triangle, though still
potent from the esoteric angle of the individual disciple or initiate.
d. Libra is also found relatively inactive in the triangle of Ray III. Today
there is no true balance but the opposition of spirit and matter is so
violent that the Libran force is relatively quiescent. Ray III is
expressing itself through Cancer, as far as the mass is concerned and
through Capricorn, on a much smaller scale, in relation to the world
disciples. Capricorn esoterically leads towards the externalisation of the
Mysteries. [492]
e. Aquarius is not today the active point for the transmission of the energy
of Ray V. However, shortly, as the Sun passes more fully into the sign
Aquarius, the triangle will again revolve and bring the Aquarian point
into a controlling position.
5. It is interesting to have in mind that Ray V governs the evolution of
consciousness through the revolution of its triangle: Leo, Sagittarius and
Aquarius. This is from the angle of hierarchical effort, as I earlier pointed out.
Throughout human evolution, this major triangle governs the relation of
humanity, through the mind, to the Hierarchy and the approach of that Hierarchy to the human centre of energy. Let me recall to your attention the
following facts in this connection:

Craft . . . . . . [493] From the standpoint of our theme (the evolution of consciousness) it
must never be forgotten that the aim is to bring the solar Angel, the Son of
Mind (called in The Secret Doctrine , the Divine Manasaputra) into the seat of
power. This task is pre-eminently entrusted to the three great Lives Who
function through Gemini-Libra-Aquarius.
A point arises here which is one of real moment or perhaps, I should say that
a question might here be asked: How does it happen that one tiny non-sacred
planet should be considered of such importance that these great Lives should
be concerned with the unfoldment of mind in humanity? The answer is that
they are not. It is humanity which—under the urge of great inflowing and
outflowing energies—is concerned with the problem of mental development.
In the last analysis, the problem of response to and interpretation of the environing contacts is one which is to be found on every planet and
particularly upon the non-sacred planets. This response must be evoked, not
only in the fourth kingdom in nature but in all the kingdoms. Our solar system
is one in which sensitivity to contact is the dominant quality; it is in process
of becoming cosmically aware; it is driven by need and environing cosmic
circumstance to develop love-wisdom and both these words are [494]
descriptive and expressive of the consciousness aspect. Love is response to
contact and this—in the human being—means understanding, inclusiveness
and identification. Wisdom connotes skill in action as the result of developed
love and the light of understanding; it is awareness of requirements and ability
to bring together into a fused relationship the need and that which will meet it.
Service is essentially a scientific mode of expressing love-wisdom under the
influence of one or other of the seven rays, according to the soul ray of the
serving disciple. The whole problem is one concerning our planetary Logos. It
might be said (in order to make our theme comprehensible to you) that the
evolutionary process—from the standpoint of the ordinary human being—is
to make the non-sacred planet, our Earth, responsive to cosmic impacts thus
bringing more inter-related and inner integration into the logoic body of
expression. There are other purposes but it is only after the third initiation that
a man begins to comprehend them.
These three constellations, cyclically and eternally, leading the “Eternal
Pilgrim” along the path of mental unfoldment produce in him the final stage
of mental evolution upon the Path of Initiation. Illumination, the term applied
to that final stage, is a synthesis of instinct, intellect and intuition. Students
must bear in mind that:
1. Gemini—expresses the relation of the pairs of opposites as they swing the
man into activity and evoke his mental perception. With the aid of the ruling
planets (Mercury and Venus) the mind begins to function and when the
esoteric planet comes into expression and transmitting potency “the
Messenger and the Angel exchange their understanding.” (Venus and the
divine Manasaputras are closely connected. A.A.B.) [495] 2. Libra—expresses the point of balance achieved, prior to a secondary
activity and the period of assimilation by the mind of past experience. These
processes, when successfully carried forward, evoke the intuition and this
brings into activity what is called the super-mind which is the response of the
illumined mind to the Mind of God.
3. Aquarius—expresses the activity of the mind which has been initiated into
the purposes of the Universal Mind. It is the sign which brings the soul into
active cooperation with the inner plan of God. This we call service.
There are, therefore, great Triangles of energy which affect the mental
response apparatus of humanity and to the above triangle which concerns the
unfoldment of the mind, two others can be added:
I. 1. Taurus . . . . Desire . . . . . . . . . . the incentive to evolutionary unfoldment in the human
.
kingdom.
2. Scorpio . . . Aspiration . . . . . . . the key to the testing of the disciple.
3. Capricorn . Illumination . . . . . the liberation of the initiate.
.
. Gêmeos . 1. Sagittarius . Direction . . . . . . . . expression of the intuition.
2. Cancer . . . . Incarnation . . . . . . experience of realisation.
.
3. Leo . . . . . . Self-consciousness mode of development.
.
. There are other major triangles which are called “triangles in consciousness”
and, as you well know, the most important of these for mankind is the triangle
of Cancer, Leo and Aquarius. They are important at this time because the
influences pouring through these three are basically responsible for the
growth of the human understanding and the unfoldment not only of man’s
response apparatus, the [496] form nature, but also of his expanding
perception of that which is contacted. This threefold process under these three
constellations produces finally the identification with that which is perceived
to be the divine essence, underlying form. This identification with that which
is the subjective and real Self and the consequent withdrawing from that
which is the not-Self is the keynote of the fourth initiation.
From the mass awareness in Cancer, the man becomes an individual in Leo
and the slow unintelligent sub-consciousness of the herd becomes the self- awareness of the developed man in Leo. Instinctual reaction gives place to
conscious, intellectual activity. This dual activity in turn gives place to the
group awareness which is the gift conferred by Aquarian activity; the superconscious divine man then transcends his limited self-consciousness and the
intuition supersedes the intellect.
At this stage in the unfoldment of the human consciousness, there is little that
I can say further anent the Science of Triangles. I have hinted at the entire
structure of living, moving, focussing and transmitting light triangles which
should underlie (and eventually will underlie) the manifested universe. I have
pointed out certain relations between the various constellations, the esoteric
planets and our Earth. I have shifted the approach of the astrological student
away from the world of tangible happenings, precipitated events, and personal
characteristics (which are distinctive of exoteric modern astrology) into the
world of conditioning energies, controlling incentives, impulses and causes,
and have thus laid down the basis of an inner esoteric astrology which must
govern this ancient science in the future. I have emphasised in your
consciousness, the web of light and energy which is the recipient of zodiacal
and other extra-systemic forces and I have pointed to the first [497] dim
outline of the astrology of the soul and of the unfolding consciousness of man.
I have presented to you some esoteric facts which must for a while at least
remain hypotheses and theories to the average astrologer and probably
unwelcome ones at that; I have made statements which are of necessity
revolutionary in nature and, therefore, disturbing, if not apparently untrue or
based on premises which deny all that the modern astrologer has worked out
and hitherto held dear. In this connection two of these ideas are basic where
the astrology of the soul is concerned:
1. The reversal of the life of the disciple upon the Wheel of Life, by means
of which his progress becomes anti-clockwise.
2. The influence of the rising sign which is held by the esoteric astrologer
to indicate soul possibility and direction, versus the personality
opportunity, offered by the nature of the vehicle of response. These two ideas are obviously revolutionary and when to them you add the
new sets of planetary rulers which I have given you, it is not surprising if you
feel the vastness of the astrological theme. This, however, was the first
reaction which I hoped to get from you. Astrology must now argue from the
universal to the particular because it must in the future deal with soul
unfoldment and not with the personality horoscope as hitherto.
At this point, I would remind you that nothing I have said negates the charting
of the personality horoscope as at present done in the case of the average man
who is proceeding clockwise around the Wheel of Life. I have but brought
into your field of astrological research, the astrology [498] of the human
consciousness, of the solar angel, of the son of mind, the spiritual man.
In the latter part of this century, what I have given to you will be
demonstrated to be true; this will happen where disciples, highly developed
aspirants and initiates are concerned. The old exoteric astrology will still
persist and prove its usefulness where the average man is in question,
focussed in his personality life and oriented towards the material world.
Much progress towards right understanding of astrology will come later when
certain new meditations on the twelve signs of the zodiac are made available.
When the world again settles down to calmer living and conditions are
adjusted to a more stable rhythm, these new meditations can form a potent
source of usefulness in “brightening the web of life” and in producing more
effective spiritual living among men.
The problem of all disciples remains the same. This is to live simultaneously
the acutely sensitive inner life of the Pilgrim upon the path of life, of a human
being in the world of human events; to live the group life of the pledged
disciple and the mass life of humanity; to fulfil his own spiritual destiny,
through the medium of a controlled personality and, at the same time, to
participate fully in the life of humanity upon Earth—this is no easy task.
We have completed what I felt possible to communicate anent the Science of
Triangles—a science which concerns the entire subjective pattern of
manifestation and the significance of which is closely inter-related with the
Trinity of manifestation. Another name for this science is the Science of Etheric Structure or Substance. That being so, that science deals with life,
quality and appearance in the three worlds of divine Purpose and Will and, for
that [499] reason, all that I can do in this treatise is to convey to you certain
“seed thoughts” which—at some future date—will blossom forth as the basic
Science of Relations. This subjective relation will be both vertical and
horizontal, particular and universal, specific and general. With the present
mental equipment of humanity, all that is possible for man is to grasp certain
facts and vaguely sense certain intuitive implications and ideas. Later, he will
perceive intuitively the underlying structure of ideas and sense the basic
synthesis which life itself contains. Therefore, beyond what I have given you,
you cannot go today.
But the aftermath of the war will change all this. Once there is a measure of
nervous release from strain and once the swing of the world movement has
again stabilised, humanity will transcend itself. The spiritual values will
emerge more clearly, the fact of the inner world will be no longer questioned
as man’s increased sensitivity enables him to respond to the higher impression
and the inner inspiration; his ability to live the vertical life of the spirit and the
horizontal life of relationship will grow with each decade.
Then the relation of life to form, of spirit to body, of the soul to the
personality will demonstrate in the realm of quality, and the quality of the
immediate divine aspect, the Christ consciousness, will emerge in a manner
undreamt of today by any of you—even the most advanced thinkers.
Speculation on your part is useless. Time alone will serve to demonstrate the
veracity of the picture I portray and the validity of the inner spiritual structure.
This structure has always been present but it has been heavily overlaid by the
material desires of mankind. A thick crust (if I may use such a word) of
thoughtforms veils and hides the inner realm of beauty and of meaning, of
quality and of spiritual consciousness. This crust is being blasted away by the
present [500] catastrophic condition in the world. Men will feel at the close of
this present war as if nothing had been left them and that they are destitute
and denuded of all that made life worth living—so dependent have they
become upon the so-called high scale of living. But these attitudes will serve
as stepping stones to a new life and a better and more simple way of living; new values will be released and comprehended among men and new goals
will be revealed. And the day will come, in the experience of humanity, when
men will look back at the pre-war centuries and wonder at their blindness and
be shocked at their selfish and materialistic past. The future will shine with an
added glory and, though difficulties and the problems incident to world
adjustment and the new relationships between the spiritual man and his
material environment will be found, the future will prove itself as the best yet
unrolled. Difficulties will be found on all planes up until the last initiation but
the destructiveness of the life process will never again be so potent. The
reason for this is that humanity is most definitely emerging from the
thralldom of matter and in such cases destruction parallels the impact of the
descending spirit upon opposing matter. Ponder on this statement. CHAPTER IV - The Sacred and NonSacred Planets
[503] There is, as you may imagine, little that I can say on this matter for it
concerns one of the great and major mysteries of initiation. It deals with and
is related to the spiritual status of the planetary Logoi, those great Beings in
Whom all forms of life on all planets live and move and have their being. It
is concerned with Their point in evolution, with Their goals and objectives
upon the cosmic Path and with the initiation for which They—in Their
incomparable and incomprehensible livingness—are preparing.
Basically it might be said that a planet is regarded as "sacred" when its
informing spiritual Life has taken five of the major cosmic initiations and
that a "non-sacred" planet is one whose planetary Logos has not taken these
initiations. This is an inadequate definition and is only in any way to be
understood if you bear in mind that initiation is a process of developing
inclusiveness .
a. Man is becoming inclusive in the planetary sense; the five major
initiations which he eventually takes give to him a range of awareness
which is infinitely beyond anything of which he can conceive at
present. These initiations endow him with the "freedom of the planet."
He is then responsive to all states of consciousness within the
planetary ring-pass-not, and is becoming sensitive to extra-planetary
perception. [504]
b. The Logos of a non-sacred planet is becoming inclusive in His
consciousness to all that is found within the solar ring-pass-not. He is
establishing an esoteric "understanding relation" with all that lives
within the body of manifestation of a solar Logos and is likewise
registering a sensitive response to the quality of the Life which
informs the Sun, Sirius. He has taken three cosmic initiations.
c. The Logos of a sacred planet transcends the knowledges, reactions and
responses which are purely those of the solar system, is conscious of or vitally responsive to the life of Sirius and is beginning to respond
consciously to the vibratory influences of the Pleiades. You need here
to bear in mind in this connection that the Pleiades—though they are
regarded as embodying the matter aspect in manifestation—are in
reality and literally the expression of that Principle of Life which we
call vitality, prana in its various stages or degrees, ether or substance.
The Logos of a sacred planet has taken five cosmic initiations.
d. The Logos of a solar system is esoterically called the "Sacred Triangle
of all-inclusive Force" because this great Being includes within His
focussed awareness the fields of expression of the Great Bear, the
Pleiades and Sirius. They are to Him what the heart, the head and the
throat centres are to the developed initiate on this planet. He has taken
those initiations of which the highest initiate upon our Earth has no
faintest conception. Forget not, that I have told you elsewhere that
there are divine aspects and divine characteristics which are [505] as
yet totally unrevealed even to the most advanced humanity. No human
being of a lower degree to that of the third initiation can even faintly
sense and dimly react to these underlying factors in the existent divine
manifestation. Today, the significance of will and its distinction from
determination, strength and fixed intention is only just beginning to
be understood. Just as a discussion of the intuition or of the nature of
the eternal revelation would be utterly meaningless to the savage in
the darkest part of the undeveloped areas of the world, so would a
discussion of these unknown divine attributes be equally meaningless
to you. All that you can comprehend (and that with the utmost
difficulty) is the three divine aspects—will, love and intelligence.
There are others, for our Logos is a sevenfold Being and four
remaining aspects are as yet unrevealed to humanity, though sensed
by the Hierarchy. These are "objectives of esoteric spiritual attention"
by the Logoi within the solar ring-pass-not.
You will see, therefore, that the section of our teaching upon which we are
now entering will be necessarily brief, because we shall be dealing with factors which must remain incomprehensible. It is consequently a waste of
your time and mine to do more than touch very briefly upon such matters.
Some understanding of the distinction between a sacred and a non-sacred
planet will come if you can realise that there is a paralleling correspondence
between the consciousness of the initiate (up to and including the third
initiation) and the consciousness of the Logos of a non-sacred planet. Soul
and body, consciousness and form are blended and a [506] definite fusion is
taking place. Two divine aspects are in process of intimate relation. The
disciple brings about this relationship within his little system, and the
planetary Logos on a far larger scale within His range of influence and
control. In this process He carries with Him all the four kingdoms in nature.
For both these lives—microcosmic and macrocosmic—this fusion produces
Transfiguration, the third initiation. The Logos of a sacred planet has carried
the divine work further along and is occupied with the task of synthesising
into one unit of conscious response and activity, the higher divine aspect,
that of the Monad, the will aspect. When this is accomplished, will, love and
intelligence are blended and spirit, soul and body are at-one. Then the
quality of the divine expression will be divine purpose, impulsed by will,
motivated by love and carried forward with intelligence.
Astrologers should here note that, in their work, they have not duly taken
into consideration (when dealing with the twelve houses or mansions of the
soul) whether the planet is sacred or not. The effect of the influences of a
sacred planet or a non-sacred one are very different, for one will affect
primarily the life in the three worlds whilst a sacred planet will aid in the
processes of affecting the fusion of soul and body, of consciousness and
form; it will also produce the quickening of the intuition (the spiritual soul)
which is the lower aspect of the Monad. The sacred planets are, as you
know, seven in number:
1. Vulcan
2. Mercury
3. Venus Júpiter . Jupiter
5. Saturn
6. Neptune
7. Uranus [507] The non-sacred planets are only five:
1. Mars
2. The Earth
3. Pluto Júpiter . The Moon, veiling a hidden planet.
5. The Sun, veiling a planet. It is interesting here to note that the non-sacred planets rule the first, the
fourth, the fifth and the eighth houses in the lesser zodiac. Our Earth is also
a non-sacred planet. You have, therefore, four non-sacred planets,
controlling or ruling a fifth non-sacred planet—a correspondence to the four
aspects of the lower man. You have there, first the physical outer shell, the
etheric or vital body, astral body and the mental body, plus a fusion with the
fifth body, the personality. The task of our planetary Logos and of all
advanced human beings is clearly to be seen. From a larger and more
synthetic attitude, you have the four kingdoms in nature and the veiled fifth
kingdom, the kingdom of God.
From still another angle you have:
Aries—ruled by Mars.
Cancer—ruled by the Moon, veiling a sacred planet.
Leo—ruled by the Sun, veiling a sacred planet.
Scorpio—ruled by Pluto.
You will note that Pluto and not Mars is here mentioned by me as a nonsacred Planet, ruling Scorpio. The reason for this is that there is a relation
between Mars and Pluto analogous to that between Venus and the Earth.
Esoterically speaking, Mars is the alter ego of Pluto; the activity of Pluto at
this time and in this lesser world cycle is very important on account of its
esoteric approach to the Earth, impelled thereto by the vivification of its life
by a display of Martian energy. The Earth, Mars and Pluto [508] form an
interesting triangle with Venus behind the scene acting as the impelling soul
acts towards a rapidly integrating personality. This triangle should not be
forgotten when casting the horoscope, because it indicates a relation and a
possibility which can be (though it often is not) a major determining factor,
prior to passing on to the Probationary Path. The four houses, governed by the four non-sacred planets (not counting the Sun) are "houses of the
personality, mundanely oriented" and the reason is not far to seek. The
seven remaining houses, governed by the seven sacred planets are not so
purely material nor are they so exoterically oriented, yet all the twelve
indicate limitation or that which withholds the Dweller in the mansion from
expanding his consciousness, if he permits himself to be imprisoned by
them. On the other hand, they offer opportunity if he is oriented towards the
higher life.
I might again point out that Mars is the transmitter of sixth ray force and it
is this which makes the first house of action in the physical body that of the
devotee who fights for that which he desires or for that to which he aspires.
The warrior, devoted to a cause, comes into being upon the field of action,
the Earth, which is itself an expression of the third Ray of Intelligent
Activity. Aries, the first house, and Mars and the Earth initiate conflict,
focussed in a form.
Again, the Moon is the ruler of Cancer and is related to the fourth ray, and
rules the fourth house. Here you have the idea of form being the custodian
of a living spiritual essence, of the home, whether the home is the fourth or
lowest aspect of the personality or the fourth kingdom in nature, but all
ruled by the fourth Ray of Harmony through Conflict—a harmony to be
wrought out within the form on Earth.
The Sun, the transmitter of the energy of the second [509] ray, rules the fifth
house or mansion of the soul, the causal body in this case; the force of Leo
is also involved, the force of the self-conscious soul. The spiritual man,
aware of his identity says in this house: "I am the eternal cause of all
relation. I am and I exist." The dualism of the second ray is first realised in
the fifth house by man, the embodied fifth principle.
Pluto, transmitting first ray energy, rules Scorpio, the sign of discipleship, of
the man ready for the fusion brought about through the influence of the
sacred planets, and governs the house of major separations and of death.
"The arrow of God pierces the heart and death takes place." But in this connection it must be remembered that death is definitely brought about by
the soul. It is the soul which shoots the arrow of death. (The upward
pointing arrow is the astrological symbol of Pluto.)
It is only in the present cycle that the Sun and Moon "veil" certain planets
and are the exoteric symbols for certain esoteric forces. As evolution
proceeds, the planets will not be veiled. Their influences will not be so
remote. At present the mechanism of the majority of the human family is
not tuned to the reception of the rays from Vulcan, Uranus or Neptune
whilst Pluto at present only evokes response from groups or from those
disciples who are enough evolved rightly to respond. The three veiled
planets—Vulcan, Uranus and Neptune are all sacred planets, embodying
first, seventh and sixth ray energies. Vulcan is never an exoteric ruler and
only comes into real activity when a man is on the Path, whilst Uranus and
Neptune are rulers of the eleventh and twelfth houses, and govern Aquarius
and Pisces. The implications will be clear to you.
It is not my intention to deal with the houses in detail. Modern astrologers
have worked this out relatively satisfactorily, [510] for the houses concern
the prison of the soul and its limitations and with these there is a widespread
familiarity. As you know, I am concerned with the astrology of the soul and
with the influences of the esoteric planets.
Three suggestions I will however make:
1. If the investigating astrologer will substitute the esoteric planets for
the orthodox exoteric planets (and I have indicated these in
connection with the signs of the zodiac) he will get much instructive
information, and (if he perseveres) the verification of my ideas.
2. If he will distinguish between the effects of the sacred planets and the
non-sacred he will find the sacred planets endeavour to fuse the
personality and make it the instrument of the soul and the non-sacred
planets influence more specifically the form nature; much light on the
pull between the pairs of opposites may then pour in. 3. If he will study the "fluid area" where the planets, veiled by the Sun
and Moon, come into play and will realise that he must decide (from a
study of the chart of the subject and any knowledge he may have)
what is the point in evolution reached and which of the three veiled
planets is the ruler, he will get much intuitive understanding. He will
find himself able to throw much light upon the problem of the
probationary disciple when considering the exoteric rulers and upon
the problems of disciples when dealing with the esoteric rulers.
If the astrologer will consider these three points and will be willing to
experiment with them, a great stride forward into the unveiling of the
astrology of the soul will take place. He will find it useful also to work out
the higher correspondences to the material realities for which the houses
stand. For instance, I will give you some idea of [511] these
correspondences in connection with the first two houses:
First House:
Physical body or form.—The causal body of the soul.
Appearance or manifestation.—The emergence of the soul.
The head. Brain.—The head centre.
Personal activity.—Soul expression.
Mannerisms, etc.—Ray types and qualities.
Second House:
Finances. Monetary interchange.—Prana.
Expenditures.—Use of energy.
Possessions.—Control of the form.
Losses.—Withdrawal from matter.
Gains.—Acquisition of spiritual powers.
The other ten houses you can work out for yourselves. It is interesting to
note, for instance, in connection with the second house (and the same idea
can be applied to all of them) that Taurus, the mother of illumination, and Venus, the endower of mind plus the embodied soul, are related and active
in this house. The light of matter and the light of the soul are both involved
in the use of energy and in the problem of what is desired, what is regarded
as loss, and what shall be the gained objective. It is, therefore, the house of
values—material or spiritual. 1. The Centres, the Rays and the Signs.
We come now to a consideration—brief and inadequate but I hope
suggestive—of the centres as they are related to [512] the planets, viewing
these planets as expressions of and transmitters of ray influences. You will
realise that I am only dealing with the interplay between the planets and the
centres where man is concerned and only in a broad and general sense
because that interplay is dependent upon—
1. The point of evolution.
2. Whether the focus of the life is
a. Below the diaphragm.
b. Above the diaphragm.
c. In process of transference from the lower to the higher.
3. The rays of the personality and the soul. Júpiter . The condition of the centres and whether they are awakened,
awakening or as yet undisturbed.
Only these generalisations are possible, owing to the vastness of the subject
and the immensity of detail in the world of effects. Another complication
lies in the fact that though there are seven major centres, there are twelve
planets which—in time and space—condition the centres. It is the centres of
initiates which are ruled only by the seven sacred planets; among average
men, some of the sacred planets dominate and some of the non-sacred. In
undeveloped man, the five non-sacred planets control, with the head and the
heart centres under the rule of two sacred planets, which planets being
determined by the rays of the soul and of the personality. As the ray type
does not emerge until there is some measure of advanced development, it will be obvious to you that the theme is thereby complicated still further;
that dogmatic assertions are [513] not possible until such time as the
astrologer is sure of the two major rays of the subject.
Certain basic assertions can nevertheless be made:
1. All the centres are governed by one or other of the rays.
2. The rays use the planets as transmitting agencies and we know which rays
—in this world cycle—are related to the different planets. As given earlier,
they are as follows:
Sacred Planets
1. Vulcan . . . . . . . . .
2. Mercury . . . . . . . .
3. Venus . . . . . . . . . . Júpiter . Jupiter . . . . . . . . . .
5. Saturn . . . . . . . . . .

2nd ray 3. Ordinary humanity is ruled by the exoteric planets; advanced humanity,
disciples and initiates by the esoteric planets. Júpiter . The Sun sign—with the exoteric planetary rulers—rules the personality,
indicates inheritance and equipment and is a summation of that which has
been, thus providing the background.
5. The rising sign, with the esoteric planetary rulers, indicates soul purpose
and points the way to the future, offering opportunity.
6. The horoscope, built around the Sun sign, is adequate for ordinary
humanity. The exoteric planets rule and the man lives within the limitations
of the twelve houses.
7. The horoscope built up around the rising sign, with the esoteric planets
ruling, will convey the destiny of the [514] disciple. As I told you, the
disciple will later be responding to the influences of the twelve arms of the three Crosses as they pour their influences through the esoteric planetary
rulers via the twelve houses.
8. The Sun sign, governed by the ruling esoteric planets and the rising sign
governed also by the esoteric planets, can both be used in casting the
horoscope of the initiate; when superimposed upon each other, the outer life
of the initiate in the three worlds and the inner life of subjective realisation
will appear. This mode of super-imposition will be a feature of the new
astrology. Mercúrio . When the Sun sign, with the exoteric rulers, is worked out in a chart, the
rising sign with the esoteric rulers is also worked out and the two are
superimposed upon each other, the problem of the disciple in any one
incarnation will appear.
If these statements are added to the three I earlier gave you, you will have
twelve suggestions as to the lines along which new astrological
investigation can run, providing proof of the accuracy of astrological
deduction and the guarantee of the truth of what I tell you.
It is just as impossible to determine which of the planetary influences are
conditioning the centres in the fourth kingdom in nature or in the Earth
(viewing it as the vehicle of the planetary Logos) as it is in man, the
individual, unless the point in evolution is know n and it can be determined
upon which stage of the Path of Return the Dweller in the form—
macrocosmic and microcosmic—is standing. The whole subject is
constantly shifting and changing, just as the individual human being is
constantly changing his focus or is to be found working first in one area
[515] of his "body of force" (the three substantial bodies) and then in
another.
Each changing personality sees a different ray force enter and each ray
governs or transmits its forces through one or other of the seven centres; the
Sun sign in each incarnation will be different, leading necessarily to a
different rising sign and therefore to a complete new set of planetary
influences. Thus the centres in the vital body come under varying pressures and stimulation. In one life, the stimulation applied may tend to vivify the
solar plexus or to drive its energies upward into its higher point of
transference, the heart centre. In another, it may be seen to be focussed in
the throat centre, and by indirect activity affecting the sacral centre and—
under the major Law of Attraction—producing a raising of the force to the
higher creative focus.
As you well know theoretically, the Science of Occultism is the Science of
Energies and of the forces upon which they make their impact; this, when
concerning man, the individual, and the centres within the human vehicle
(major and minor) leads to the Science of Laya Yoga or of the force centres.
These again, according to astrological deduction, come under the influence
of certain planetary rulers. These relate them in turn to certain great
Triangles of Force, formed of three major conditioning constellations.
Therefore, the emphasis laid upon the Science of Triangles and its including
Science of Esoteric Astrology; this must inevitably take shape in terms of
energy, received, transferred and used, and throw light upon the abstruse
factors which condition the centres and thus make man what he is at any one
time. It is a statement of fact that the world of the occultist is the world of
energy, of forces, of their origin, their point of impact and the methods of
their assimilation [516] and transference or elimination. Unless, however,
there is some scientific method of comprehension, some mode of adapting
the life to these factors and some process of experimentation in order to
prove the fact, the statement remains relatively useless to the intelligent
human being; it remains in the form of an hypothesis, to be proved or
disproved. The man who is attempting to master his lower nature and has
the goal of expressing his innate divinity requires a golden thread whereby
he can find his way out of the caverns of bewilderment and the areas of
speculation and enquiry. This process of investigation, deduction and proof,
the Science of Esoteric Astrology and its subsidiary sciences will eventually
provide. The foundation is already laid. What I here give can provide
another step forward and further light. It might here be stated that until the
antahkarana (the bridge of light between the higher and the lower minds,
between the Spiritual Triad and the three-fold personality) is being definitely constructed, these sciences will remain obscure to the average
intellect. Once, however, the intuition can come into action, via the
antahkarana, light will gradually begin to pour in. The world must begin to
accept and give weight to the conclusions of its intuitives; they have ever
taken the first needed steps in the unfoldment of the human consciousness.
It is the complexity of detail which primarily is responsible for the
confusion. The intuition (as the philosopher understands it) is the ability to
arrive at knowledge through the activity of some innate sense, apart from
the reasoning or logical processes. It comes into activity when the resources
of the lower mind have been used, explored and exhausted. Then, and then
only, the true intuition begins to function. It is the sense of synthesis, the
ability to think in wholes, and to touch the world of causes. When this
becomes possible, the [517] investigating astrologer will find that the
complexities of the problem will disappear and the details fall into obvious
position and in such a manner that the sum total will appear in a blinding
light of surety. At present students cannot see the wood for the trees, as the
proverb says, and that proverb is right. These sciences are mutually
interpreting.
During the life cycle of humanity through which we are now passing, in the
relation between the centres and the rays and, therefore, between the centres
and the planets, it will be found that the centres are governed by the
following rays:
AVERAGE MAN—EXOTERIC PLANETS
1. Head Centre . . . . . . . . . . .
2. Ajna Centre . . . . . . . . . . .
3. Throat Centre . . . . . . . . . . Júpiter . Heart Centre . . . . . . . . . . .

Pluto To these rays must be added (in both groups of human beings) the fourth ray
which governs humanity itself as a centre in the body of the planetary
Logos, thus bringing all the ray influences into a sevenfold stream of
energy, playing upon the lower self in the three worlds or upon those who
are entering into or are a part of the fifth kingdom in nature. Intensifying the
problem for humanity as a whole is the problem of the individual within that
whole. To the influences to which he is subjected as an individual through
his [518] past and his own peculiar horoscope and to those in which he
shares as a part of the fourth kingdom in nature must be added the effects of
his two major rays (personal and egoic). These indicate his type of
mechanism and his soul quality. It must not be forgotten either that his
seven centres are in close relation to the planetary centres and that he is
conditioned not only by the centres in his own nature and their rays but also
by the centres found within the human kingdom and also by the planetary
centres. With these we will now proceed to deal. 2. The Races, the Rays and the Signs.
The theme we will now consider is one which is of general interest but not
of individual moment. Arguing as one ever must from the universal to the
particular, it is essential that humanity relates its own mechanism to the
greater mechanism through which the planetary Life functions and views his
soul as an infinitesimal part of the world soul. It is necessary for him,
therefore, to relate his Sun sign to his rising sign and his soul to his
personality, viewing both as aspects and integral parts of the human family.
This will be increasingly the case. This process is beginning to demonstrate
in the steadily expanding group, national and racial consciousness which
humanity is today demonstrating—a consciousness which shows as a
spiritual inclusiveness or as an abnormal and wicked attempt (from the standpoint of the soul) to fuse and blend all nations into a world order, based
on material issues and dominated by a material vision. There was nothing
spiritual in the vision of the leaders of the powers which were called the
Axis powers. But the spiritual intent of mankind is slowly growing and the
great Law of Contrasts will eventually bring illumination.
[519] I make these references to the present world situation because unless
what I have to say is practical in value during this century of destiny, I
might as well work at other modes and methods of raising the human
consciousness. But there are those who see the issues clearly and will make
due application of the imparted truths and for them I write.
Our theme concerns the planetary centres, the rays and the signs which
govern and control them. I would first of all call your attention to the
following facts which will bear repetition:
1. Our Earth, being a non-sacred planet, is in process of becoming a
sacred planet. This means an interim of upheaval, chaos and of
difficulty.
2. This transference out of the lower states of consciousness, expressed
through the lower centres, into a higher state, can and will take place
in this world period and in this century if humanity so wills it, if the
Forces of Light eventually triumph and if the new world order comes
into being. This it will do if the lessons of the war are learnt and right
action follows as a result.
3. Three factors must also be borne in mind:
a. The whole problem is vaster than anything the human
consciousness can grasp, because it concerns the life experience
and a point of crisis in the life of the planetary Logos.
b. He, the Lord of the World, is releasing new energies into the form
aspect, i.e., into the Life and the lives of the various kingdoms in
nature.
Humanity, being the most developed—both from the angle of the
mechanism and of consciousness—is the point of greatest response. The mineral [520] kingdom, through the excessive use of its form
in the meeting of war necessities—munitions, ships, and planes,
etc.—is being profoundly affected as are buildings, for instance, in
blasted cities; the vegetable kingdom is almost as deeply affected
through the destruction of vast areas of forests, fields and wide
spaces of vegetation.
c. The Shamballa force, thus pursuing its work of destruction, is an
aspect of the will and intention of the planetary Logos but its first
and primary effect has been to stimulate the will-to-power and the
will-to-have of certain great and unspiritual groups. Later this will
aspect will evoke the will-to-good and the will-to-build and to this
humanity will respond on a large scale. Thus the evil which is now
being spread abroad by the opponents of the Forces of Light will be
neutralised by the fixed intention of the men and women of
goodwill to work for the good of the whole and not for any one
part.
It might, therefore, be said that what is truly taking place in the world today
is the transference of the energy of the planetary solar plexus to the
planetary heart centre. The forces of cupidity, aggression, glamour and
greed will be transmuted in the present furnace of pain and fiery agony and
will be raised into the heart centre. There they will be changed into the
power of sacrifice, of inclusive surrender, of clear vision of the whole, and
into cooperation; this is an aspect of the principle of sharing.
When I say these words, I am not speaking idealistically or mystically. I am
pointing out the immediate goal; I am indicating a problem of our planetary
Deity; I am giving [521] you the clue to a scientific process which is going
on under our eyes and which is today at a point of crisis.
As this is the Aryan or fifth root-race (and I do not use this term in the
German, materialistic and untrue sense) there are today in the body of Him
in Whom we live and move and have our being, five focal points of spiritual
energy, expressing themselves through five awakened centres in that body.
These five are: 1. Geneva.—The European continent.
2. London.—The British Commonwealth of Nations.
3. New York.—The American continent. Júpiter . Darjeeling.—Central and Western Asia.
5. Tokyo.—For the Far East.
Today, these five centres are being abnormally and deliberately stimulated
and vitalised. The energy which flows from them is profoundly affecting the
world, holding great hope for the future but producing most disrupting and
disastrous effects where the material side of human life is concerned. There
are two centres in the planetary Life which are as yet relatively quiescent as
far as any world effect is concerned. To them I assign no other focal point
beyond hinting that within the continent of Africa one will some day be
found, and later still (many millions of years ahead) another will be
discovered in the region of Australia. It is, however, with the five centres in
this fifth root-race that we are concerned.
The force which the centre at Geneva is expressing (at present ineffectually,
though later a change will come) is that of the second Ray of Love-Wisdom,
with its major emphasis at this time upon the quality of inclusiveness. It is
concerned with the "binding together in brotherly love" and [522] with the
expression of the nature of service. This planetary centre, which conditions
the little country of Switzerland, has had a most potent effect upon that
country; a study of these effects will demonstrate future possibility for the
world, once the flow of its energy is less obstructed. It has produced the
fusion of three powerful racial types in group formation and not through
admixture as in the United States; it has enabled two relatively antagonistic
divisions of the Christian faith to work together with a minimum of friction;
it has made Geneva the origin of the Red Cross—that world activity which
works impartially with and for the nationals of all countries and for the
prisoners of all nations; it housed that sad though well-intentioned
experiment which was called the League of Nations; it is that which has protected that small country from the aggressive sweep of the Axis powers.
The motto or note of this centre is "I seek to fuse, to blend and serve."
The force which is centred in London is that of the first Ray of Will or
Power in its building aspect and not in its destroying aspect. It is the service
of the whole which is being attempted at great cost and the effort is to
express the Law of Synthesis which is the new emphasis, pouring through
from Shamballa. Hence the fact that the governments of many nations found
asylum in Great Britain. Likewise, if the Forces of Light triumph because of
the cooperation of mankind, the energy expressing itself through this
powerful empire will be potent in establishing a world order of intelligent
justice and a fair economic distribution. The keynote of this force is "I
serve," as I told you earlier in this treatise (see the last page of A Treatise on
the Seven Rays , Vol. I).
The force expressing itself through the centre, New York, is the force of the
sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism. [523] Hence the conflicts everywhere to
be found between the varying ideologies and the major conflict between
those who stand for the great ideal of world unity brought about by a united
effort of the Forces of Light, backed by the cooperative effort of all the
democratic nations and the separative materialistic attitude of those who
seek to keep the United States from assuming her responsibilities and her
rightful place in world affairs. This latter group, if they succeed in their
endeavour, will deny the United States her share in the "gifts of the gods in
the coming age of peace which will succeed this present point of critical
suspension," as the Old Commentary phrases it. The sixth ray is either
militant and active, or mystical, pacific and at present futile, and these two
aspects at present condition the United States. The keynote of this world
centre is "I light the Way" and this is the privilege of the States if its people
so choose and permit worldwide humanitarian, self-sacrifice (self-initiated)
and firm decision to stand by righteousness to govern their present attitudes
and policies. This is slowly coming to pass and the selfish voices of the
blind idealists, the fearful and the separative are dying out. All this is
happening under the inspiration of service, motivated by love. Thus the two major democracies can eventually restore world order, negate the old order
of selfishness and aggression and usher in the new order of world
understanding, world sharing and world peace. Peace will be the result of
understanding and sharing and not the origin of them as the pacifists so
often imply.
The force pouring through Darjeeling at this time is that of the first Ray of
Will or Power. The egoic ray of India is the first ray and hence the
immediate effect of the inpouring Shamballa force is to stimulate the willto-power of all dictators, whether they are the would-be world dictators
[524] such as Hitler and his group of evil men, ecclesiastical dictators in
any religion, business dictators in any business group in any part of the
world or those minor dictators, the tyrant in the home. It is interesting to
note that the keynote of India is "I hide the light" and this has been
interpreted to mean that the light pours forth from the East, and that the gift
of India to the world is the light of the Ageless Wisdom. This is true in a
sense, but there is a wider and deeper sense in which it will prove true.
When the intent and purpose of the great Life which works through
Shamballa is carried out and is in process of expression, a light will be
revealed which has never yet been seen or known. There is a word in the
Christian Scriptures which says "In that light shall we see light"; this means
that through the medium of the light of wisdom shed abroad in our hearts
through the Ageless Wisdom, we shall eventually see the Light of Life itself
—something meaningless and inexplicable to humanity at present but which
will be later revealed when the present point of crisis is surmounted. Of its
nature and its effect, I have naught to say to you at present.
I would like here to interpolate some remarks. It is of deep moment to
realise that Great Britain and the United States are closely related and that
this relation makes certain realities and activities inevitable, once the soul of
each nation is functioning potently; and that India and Great Britain are
related through the first ray personality of Great Britain and the egoic ray of
India. The implications are clear and interesting and also encouraging. The
consciousness aspect of the British people is steadily shifting into an expression of their second ray soul and hence their seizing upon the
opportunity at this time to serve humanity at immense cost. The same thing
is happening to the American people. The problem of shifting idealisms is
great, as I have [525] said, and the temptation is to hide behind the glamour
of fighting for an ideal rather than react to world need, and to omit to react
to the ray of the soul which is the second ray of love.
The forces flowing through Tokyo are those of the first Ray in its lower
materialistic aspect. Japan is governed by the soul ray in the consciousness
of its leaders. Its sixth ray personality is responding to the call of the first
ray energy; hence all the present unhappy attitudes and activities, and hence
also its link with Germany through the soul ray of both nations and with
Italy through the personality rays. Hence, therefore, the Axis.
I would here point out that in these inter-relations is no inevitable fate or
unavoidable destiny. The aim of the individual disciple is to handle the
forces which play through him in such a manner that only constructive good
can eventuate. He can misuse energy or employ it for soul ends. So it is with
nations and races. The fate of the nations lies in the hands of its leaders
usually; they marshal the nations' forces, focus the national intent (if
intuitive enough) and develop the characteristics of the people, leaving in
fact behind them the memory of symbols of national intent, ideals or
corruption. This could be seen working out in a demonstrable way in the
two great guiding groups of world leaders: The three Axis groups of leaders,
dominated by the evil German group, with Italy and Japan fighting at
intervals (consciously seldom but unconsciously often) against the evil
influence, and the second group—the leaders of the Allied Cause who
represent their nations. No matter what past history may indicate in
connection with many of the allied nations (past aggressions, ancient
cruelties and wrong doing), they sought to cooperate with the Forces of
Light [526] and endeavoured to salvage human freedom—political,
religious and economic.
I would also point out in passing that the two major divisions of the world—
the Occident and the Orient—are also governed by certain ray energies, as follows:
The Occident . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Orient . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Soul Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Personality Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Soul Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Personality Ray . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ray Gêmeos Ray IV
Ray IV
Ray III I would remind you that we are in a period of shifting rays and that they
change both for individuals and nations, for hemispheres and planets. All
can move off a minor ray on to a major if destiny decrees. A study of the
above tabulation will give much light to the inter-human relation. Three
great countries hold the destiny of humanity in their hands at this time: The
United States of America, Great Britain and Russia. Great fusing, racial
experiments are going on in all these lands; the rule of the people is being
developed in all of them though it is as yet in an embryonic stage. In Russia
it is being retarded by a dictatorship which will shortly end; in the States by
corrupt politics and in Great Britain by ancient imperialistic tendencies. But
democratic principles are being developed, if not controlling; religious unity
is being established though it is not yet functioning and all three countries
are learning very rapidly, though the United States at present is learning the
most slowly.
The Occident and the Orient are linked through the personality ray of the
Occident and the egoic ray of the Orient and this indicates eventual
understanding once the second ray occidental soul becomes the dominant
factor. When these various relationships are somewhat grasped by the
peoples of the world you will get the clue to the various happenings taking
place today and will understand the goal [527] and the method of its
attainment more clearly. There is much deep research work to be done, for
the science of energy relationships is yet in its infancy. The next few years
will see it gain. What is really happening is a shift in the human
consciousness from its focus on individual energies, functioning through
some specific ring-pass-not (individual, national, continental or racial) to a
grasp of their inter-relation and effects upon each other. This science can be
studied in various ways: 1. From the angle of antagonisms which seem inevitable and which can
be accounted for by the ray energies and which can be offset by soul
energies rightly employed.
2. From the angle of identity of forces, leading inevitably to identity of
interests and activities.
3. From the angle of fusion, of unity, of vision and of goals. Júpiter . From the angle of humanity as a whole. If it is remembered that
humanity is primarily governed by two rays (the second and the
fourth) it will be found that those nations and countries whose
governing rays are also the second and the fourth must and will play
an important part in determining human destiny.
Therefore, through the five major centres in the planet today, spiritual
energy is streaming forth, and according to the vehicle of expression which
receives its impact so will be the reaction and activity and so will be the
type of consciousness, interpreting and using it. The ancient occult truism
remains accurate: "Consciousness is dependent upon its vehicle for
expression and both are dependent upon life and energy for existence." This
remains an immutable law.
[528] The five cities which are the exoteric expression of the esoteric centre
of force and through which the Hierarchy and Shamballa are seeking to
work are the correspondence in the planetary body to the four centres up the
spine and the ajna centre in the body of humanity and of individual man. In
all three cases, they are "living, vital, focal points of dynamic force" to a
greater or less extent. Some predominantly express soul energy and some
personality force; some are influenced by Shamballa and some by the
Hierarchy. The head centre of the Occident is beginning to react to second
ray energy and the ajna centre to fourth ray energy and in this lies the hope
of the race of men. 3. Planetary and Systemic Centres. I have given you here and elsewhere in my writings all that it is at this time
possible to give anent the planetary centres and the rays, including the rays
of nations and of races. You will find a wealth of information hidden in my
various statements if due search is made and the material is gathered
together into a coherent whole. I would ask you to study and compare, to
read and search topically and to extract all that I have said about the various
nations, their governing constellations and their planetary rulers. There is a
wide field of research here. This research will fall into several categories:
1. Research into the nature of man's centres, the nature and influences of
their governing planets, their inter-relation from the energy angle and the
quality of the ray forces which are seeking expression, plus a knowledge of
the personality and egoic rays. Out of this will come an understanding grasp
of the human constitution [529] which will reveal all relationships and
produce two basic "events in time":
a. The blending of the subjective and objective life of the individual in
the waking consciousness.
b. A new relation established between men which will be based upon the
above fusion.
2. Research into the various national centres and their esoteric ruling
energies, revealing in a more universal manner and with a wider horizon the
destiny of humanity in relation to its group units, large and small. The soul
and personality qualities of nations will be studied, the centres within each
nation which focus certain ray energies will be noted, and the qualitative
emanations of its five or six major cities will be investigated. Let me here
give you an instance of what I mean: the influences of New York,
Washington, Chicago, Kansas City and Los Angeles will be the subject of
scientific research; the psychic atmosphere and the intellectual appeal will
be studied, effort will be made to discover the soul quality and the
personality nature (the spiritual and the materialistic tendencies) of these
great aggregations of human beings which have come into expression in
certain fixed localities because they are expressions of the force centres in
the vital body of the nation. Similarly, in connection with the British Empire, a study will be made of London, Sydney, Johannesburg, Toronto
and Vancouver with subsidiary studies of Calcutta, Delhi, Singapore,
Jamaica and Madras which are all subjectively related in a manner
unforeseen by students at present. Under the plan and contingent upon the
energies pouring through the five planetary centres according [530] to plan,
there are three great fusing energies or vital centres present upon our planet:
a. Russia, fusing and blending eastern Europe and western and northern
Asia.
b. The United States (and later South America) fusing and blending
central and western Europe and the entire western hemisphere.
c. The British Empire, fusing and blending races and men throughout the
entire world.
In the hands of these nations lies the destiny of the planet. These are the
three major world blocs from the consciousness angle and from the angle of
world synthesis. Other and lesser nations will participate in the process with
full independence and cooperation, voluntarily and through the perfecting of
their national life in the interests of the whole of humanity, and through the
desire to express and preserve their soul integrity and their purified national
purpose (which purification is now going on). The keynote, however, of
human living will be struck by Russia, Great Britain and the United States
—not because of their power, their historical past and their material
resources or territorial extent but because they are in a position to fuse and
blend the many types, because they are far-visioned in their world purpose,
because they are not basically selfish in their intent, and because the
government of the peoples reaches down into the depths of each nation and
is fundamentally for the people . Their basic Constitution, Magna Charta
and Bill of Rights are human. Other nations will be gradually swept into line
with these fundamental spiritual requirements, or—if they are already based
on these human principles and not on [531] the rule of a powerful minority,
exploiting an unhappy majority—they will cooperate freely with these
greater nations in a federation of purpose and of interests until such time
when all the nations of the world see the vision clear, forego their selfish aims and agree in the unity of the work to be done for the whole. Humanity
will then emerge into the light of freedom with a revealed beauty and a
spiritual purpose, hitherto unknown.
3. Research into the relation of the planetary centres to the systemic centres,
the sacred planets and the energies pouring through them from the
constellations which they "rule" in the esoteric sense. This is one of the
paradoxes of occultism but it can be understood if the student remembers
that the centres in his etheric body rule the planet in so far as they are
receptive or non-receptive to the influences emanating from the planet, via
the planetary centres.
Beginning as ever with the study of the microcosm as the clue to the
macrocosm, but seeking at the same time to envisage the macrocosm in
order to understand the microcosm, man will some day establish an
intelligent relation to the whole of which he is a part and this with conscious
cooperation. Thus the higher mind and the lower mind, the abstract and the
concrete, the subjective and the objective will be brought into a functioning
unity and man will be whole .
I cannot give you the relation of the planetary centres to the human centres
or of the systemic centres to the planets. Too much knowledge would be
given too soon and prior to the time when there is enough love present in
human nature to offset the possible misuse of energy with [532] its often
disastrous consequences. The colours, the mathematical rate of the higher
vibrations which emanate from the centres—individual, planetary and
systemic—and the quality (esoterically understood) of the energies must be
the subject of human research and self-ascertained. The clues and the hints
have been given in the Ageless Wisdom. The slower method of research is
the safer at present. In the next century and early in the century an initiate
will appear and will carry on their teaching. It will be under the same
"impression" for my task is not yet completed and this series of bridging
Treatises between the material knowledge of man and the science of the
initiates has still another phase to run. But the remainder of this century
must be dedicated to rebuilding the shrine of man's living, to reconstructing the form of humanity's life, to reconstituting the new civilisation upon the
foundations of the old and to the reorganising of the structures of world
thought, world politics, plus the redistribution of the world's resources in
conformity to divine purpose. Then and only then will it be possible to carry
the revelation further.
All this is dependent upon the triumph of the Forces of Light and the
consequent victory of those who stand for human freedom. If the forces of
materialism and cruelty triumph and selfish and wicked national interests
and ambitions had prevailed, the revelation would still come but very much
later. The issue is not in the balance and there is no need to despair. The
courage of those fighting for freedom remains unimpaired. The Hierarchy
stands . Light is breaking in the world as the realities of the situation emerge
more clearly.
Be of good cheer for there is no true defeat of the human spirit; there is no
final extinction of the divine in man, for divinity ever rises triumphant from
the darkest [533] pit of hell. There is need however to overcome the inertia
of the material nature in response to human need, individually and by the
nations not engrossed with the essentials of the situation. This shows signs
of happening. There is no power on Earth which can prevent the advance of
man towards his destined goal and no combination of powers can hold him
back. CHAPTER V - Three Major Constellations
and the Zodiac
[537] There exists at this time an inter-relation between three of the
constellations upon which I would like somewhat to enlarge, because their
potency and the climax of their inter-relation is being reached at this time.
From 1975 on, that potency will greatly lessen until it fades out. The period of
this interplay of three major energies and their focussed potent effect upon our
planet began in 1875, achieved momentum in 1925, will reach its highest
expression (for good or evil) in 1945 and will then decline slowly until 1975.
These three constellations are: Leo, Capricorn and Pisces. These are curiously
and most mysteriously related to the fourth kingdom in nature and therefore to
the evolution and the destiny of the human family. Add to these the emerging
energy of Aquarius, and you have four energies which are playing upon the
vehicles of men and producing peculiar effects—both destructive and
constructive.
Twice before has this relation and intensification of vibration occurred: At the
time of the coming of the Sons of Mind to the Earth during the Lemurian age
and once in the Atlantean period at the climax of the conflict between the
Lords of the Dark Face and the Lords of the Shining Countenance. (See
Volume Gêmeos of The Secret Doctrine or the Vishnu Purana . A.A.B.) In the
earlier activity, the fourth active constellation was Gemini and in the
Atlantean [538] it was Sagittarius. The effect then was on the physical plane
(the earliest was on the mental) and the great Flood eventuated to which the
Bible bears testimony. It brought about the destruction of the humanity of the
time, but released the indwelling life for further experience and development. 1. Leo, Capricorn and Pisces.
The effects produced are mass effects and the Rulers of these constellations
which move into activity at this time are those listed in one of the earlier
tabulations which I gave you. Leo.—Ruler: The Sun, veiling Uranus, the planet of occultism, and that
which governs group relations, organisations and the eleventh House. It
relates the Leo influence to Aquarius.
Capricorn.—Ruler: Venus, governing the second House, which is
concerned with economics, the distribution of money and metals and
which rules Taurus, the “seed house” of illumination and the new
emerging light. Venus also rules Libra exoterically and the seventh
House wherein enemies are recognised and unions and friendships
achieved.
Pisces.—Ruler: Pluto, governing the eighth House, the house of death, of
dissolution, of detachment and ruling Scorpio, the sign of testing and of
discipleship.
This tabulation and its inferred relationships warrant careful study in the light
of modern affairs and the present world situation. From the angle of the ray
energies involved and seeking to control human life, you have the influence
of the seventh Ray of Ceremonial Law, Order and Magic, [539] the fifth Ray
of Concrete Knowledge, or Science and the first Ray of Will unitedly bringing
about fundamental changes, and ushering in the new era. This combination is
terrifically potent and brings about the precipitation of inner forces, an
increased activity of the lower mind and an outpouring of the Shamballa force
—all three of which can be seen functioning in the field of the planetary life
today as never before. The greater effect is produced owing to the greatly
increased sensitivity of mankind, compared to the two other times in which
(in cyclic evolution) these three constellations were active. The combination
is seen demonstrating in human affairs today. It was responsible for the
organisation which lay behind the World War—an organisation involving all
three levels in the threefold world of human evolution and which affects also
the three kingdoms in nature, climaxing in the fourth. It is responsible for the
use of mental power on a vast scale, notably in the material sense as at present
and for the achievement of human desire, plus the self-will of an evil few,
who, because of the seeds of evil in their own nature, respond to the lower
aspects of this force. It is also responsible for the steadily mounting will-togood of the awakening many. A close analysis of these constellations, their planetary rulers and the ray
forces which these transmit will clarify the world issues in an amazing
manner, plus an appreciation of the houses in which these effects will
primarily be felt. The following brief tabulation may prove useful, even if it is
only a repetition of that earlier said:
Constellation Ruler Ray House Leo . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Capricorn . . . . . . . .
Pisces . . . . . . . . . . . The Sun (Uranus) . .
Venus . . . . . . . . . . . .
Pluto . . . . . . . . . . . . Seventh . . . . .
Fifth . . . . . . .
First . . . . . . . Eleventh
Second and Seventh
Eighth [540] The energies poured out, therefore, will be felt primarily in those
aspects of human living which are influenced by the rulers of certain houses.
The seventh Ray of Ceremonial Order or Organisation is felt in the house of
relationships, of organisations and of mutual effort and of aspiration (either
towards good or evil). The forces of this ray work out on the seventh or
physical plane—the plane whereon major changes in all forms are made and
on which the disciple must firmly stand as he takes initiation.
This seventh ray sweeps into organised and directed activity the world of
forces upon the outer sphere of manifestation, and produces the precipitation
of Karma, which, in this case leads to:
1. The working out into expression of all the subjective evil of the life of
humanity, thus producing the world war.
2. The initiation of the planetary Logos and—with Him—of all who take their
stand upon the side of the Forces of Light. This takes various forms as far as
humanity is concerned:
a. The initiation of the consciousness of the masses of men into the
Aquarian Age, bringing them under the new influences and potencies,
and enabling them to make a response of which they would not
otherwise be capable.
b. The initiation of the aspirants of the world on to the Path of Accepted
Discipleship. c. The bringing about of certain major initiations in the case of those world
disciples who are ready enough and strong enough to take them.
[541] In spite of the vast destruction everywhere, the work of the seventh ray
is being increasingly felt; the destruction of the forces of evil is going on even
though at great cost to the Forces of Light; simultaneously there is a
regrouping and a rearrangement of human attitudes and thought; this is
brought about as a result of the tremendous demand upon the world thinkers
for direction and guidance. Thus the nebulous structure and the dim outlines
of the New Age civilisation can already be seen.
The underlying spirit of freedom will triumph as it is organised into revolt
against slavery. To this end, the seventh ray will increasingly make
contribution.
Leo, the constellation in which the keynote is full self-consciousness, is
becoming increasingly dominant. The issues involved in today’s situation are
becoming clearer in the minds of the masses of the people; they can and will
act with full awareness and intentional conscious purpose when the right time
comes and will understand the implications and the price involved in a
manner not hitherto possible. Hence the meaning back of my reiterated
statement that the issues and determinations of the present situation are in the
hands of humanity itself. The “stars in their courses” will aid humanity or
bring destruction, according to human determinations. Men can achieve
liberty and organise for the New Age with its unique civilisation and
constructive synthesis, or they can commit suicide (if I may speak
symbolically) and hand over their immediate future to the forces of evil and
of death. These work for the death of all the true values and of all for which
the human spirit has fought.
The self-consciousness aspect of the human being is [542] being steadily
expanded under this major interplay and through the forces transmitted by
Uranus, via the eleventh house, and will ultimately give place to group
consciousness and group relationships and group work. Hence the trend
towards amalgamation today, towards federation, spheres of action and the
many groups which distinguish increasingly human intercourse. The group spirit and the forms through which it will express itself are being increasingly
demonstrated and this constitutes a veritable initiation for the race. It is the
emergence of the glory of the human spirit in a more definite and arresting
way and involves an orientation towards freedom which will later stand in the
historical records as the outstanding characteristic of this age of major
conflict. Humanity is today participating in the preparatory tests for initiation,
the initiation of the world disciple. Great is your privilege to be taking part in
this. Forget not that eleven is the number of the Initiate and that today it is the
eleventh house which is so dominant; forget not that Aquarius, the eleventh
sign, is the sign of universal relationships, interplay and consciousness. For all
this, the combination of signs, Leo, Capricorn and Pisces—is preparing the
race.
The evil men who guided the destiny of Germany talked of world groups and
of the European Order of Nations but it was a grouping around Germany as
the centre and for the selfish interests of Germany. The grouping which is a
part of the divine Plan is not around any one nation but a grouping based on
the ideal of brotherhood, on the will-to-good and on the freedom of the whole.
One expresses a selfish materialistic distortion and the other a spiritual
objective.
Capricorn is related, as you have been told, to initiation; [543] it is also the
sign of the coming world Saviour and these higher aspects of the Capricornian
influences can be potently demonstrated if humanity so wills it and will take
advantage of the Venusian influence to use the mind as the reflector of soul
purpose. If this does not take place, the present situation will turn into
something far worse—a situation wherein the mass of men will be “reinitiated into the Earth and forced to turn their backs upon the dawning light.”
A dark period of civilisation will ensue. Instead of the dark cave of initiation
wherein the light of the initiate’s own nature illumines the darkness and so
demonstrates his command of light, the dark cave of materialism and of
physical, animal control will take the place of the “lighted Way.” The earthy
aspect of Capricorn, the lowest concrete aspect of the mind and an increased
control by the Taurian spirit in its worst form will take the place of the divine possibility of entrance into greater light, the manifestation of the soul nature
and the recognition of the “light which is found in the eye of the Bull.”
Such are the possibilities confronting the world of men today; the issue is
dependent upon the final triumph of the Forces of Light (working through the
Allied nations) or on the control of the forces of materialism. Germany
represented materialism in the West and Japan in the East. I would also add
that those who in both nations (and there are many such) represent the
“lighted Way” were so imprisoned in their environment and so dominated in
their personalities by the thoughtform of their powerful rulers that for them
right action was impossible. It is this thought which prompts the Hierarchy to
renewed effort. The Forces of Light recognise and work for the spiritual good
of all people, irrespective of their national relations. They are [544] working
for the release of Germany from the glamour which descended upon her
people. The Hierarchy makes a distinction between the bewildered mass, the
wrongly educated youth and the obsessed leaders in all branches of the
government. The latter are “shells,” obsessed by evil entities and hence their
dynamic, one-pointed potency, hence also their extreme skill and cunning,
based on very ancient evil experience and hence also the well-nigh ludicrous
falsity of their propaganda. They are the spirit of materialism embodied,
devoid of all true feeling and perception, lacking the light of love and
understanding, but powerfully animated by the energy of substance itself. It is
time that men woke up to the nature of these beings who sought (under the
present grouping of constellations) to enslave the race. The earthly influence
of Capricorn made their activity possible; they themselves have been evoked
out of their evil past by the material side of humanity itself and the potency of
the massed selfishness of mankind. In like manner, the Forces of Light can be
evoked in tremendous potency but only by the massed aspiration and spiritual
desires of the peoples of the Earth. Of this evocation, there are already signs.
The Venusian influence—as you will have noted—brings in likewise the
influences of Libra. You find today a cycle wherein an appropriate balance or
point of equilibrium has been brought about which is a correspondence to the
great point of balance on the Path of Involution when spirit and matter
balanced each other, making the upward arc of evolution the next possible step. This time the balancing is on mental levels; in the earlier crisis, it was on
the physical plane. This point of equilibrium is to humanity, to the Sons of
Mind, what the earlier point of crisis was to the planetary [545] Logos. This is
a fact to be remembered and given due place in your thinking. The problem to
be solved is: Which aspect of humanity will finally triumph and so disturb the
balance by achieving dominance—spirit or matter, soul or personality? Such
is the nature of these points of crisis. As in the planetary crisis, if spirit should
triumph, a new feature, function or quality of divinity will begin to manifest
—the highest mind. In the human crisis, the same thing is possible. If the
spirit of man triumphs, then the aspect of true love in its divine nature and
with its group emphasis will be possible. Such are the issues involved.
To bring about the full presentation of the choice and to indicate the mode
whereby the spirit of man can triumph, the influence of Pisces was called in
or rather evoked. It is conditions which evoke, aided at times by voiced Words
of Power on the part of the Hierarchy. Pisces, through its ruler, Pluto (ruling
both the mass and the disciples esoterically), necessitated the triumph of death
—not necessarily physical death—leading to the dissolution of the form of
man. It is frequently the death or ending of old forms of civilisations which
cyclically come and go; of religious teaching when it does not serve the need
of the spiritual nature of the people (as is today the case); of educational
processes which fail to educate the developing nature of man and serve only
to delude and imprison. When I say this, I mean not the death of religion or of
forms of thought. I refer here to death as the Great Releaser, which shatters
the forms which are bringing death to that which is embodied. It is to this
philosophic death in its lowest aspect that Germany has responded. The
destruction of religion which Germany sought to bring about is not a prelude
to the establishment of a better approach to divinity but the effort [546] to
evoke the ancient gods, to deify the forms of matter and to make the state the
supreme end of men’s lives; the spirit of love and of individual right relations
are not known—those relations which are so basically characteristic of the
Kingdom of God.
The completely atheistic approach of Russia to the problem of religion at the
time of, and during the period of, the revolution is much more sound than the German approach. The spirit of man in its essential divinity can be trusted to
arise unhurt from the experience in answer to the call of the undying spirit.
This call can sound forth clearly in a void and be evoked by time and
circumstance—unopposed if the only difficulty with which it is confronted is
the spirit of agnosticism and an attitude of questioning. But the imposition of
the ancient myths in an effort to still the demand for truth and the carefully
planned attack upon the Christ of the world is dangerous, evil, and will cause
retrogression. Of these, the rulers of Germany were guilty. They did not
succeed in quenching the spiritual life of the nation because religion in
Germany was not corrupt as it was in Russia and needed not such a drastic
purification. These are points which thinkers would do well to remember. In
mystical Russia, the seeds of the spiritual life are emerging to fresh beauty
and a triumphant religious ideal is on its way to manifest; in Germany, ancient
crystallised forms of belief are met with something more ancient still and the
combination of world dislike and decadent forms will make the lot of the
German people one of great tragedy. In the consequent struggle for that which
is spiritually alive and in the effort to regain belief in the realities of divine
revelation, and in the determination to right the evil wrought by her rulers to
the world, Germany may some day regain the expression of soul life. To this
end, she must be first released [547] from evil rule and then aided to regain
her spiritual standing.
Pluto, therefore, comes into full force and expression in order to stage the
testings of the world disciple and to this end brings in the potency of Scorpio,
the sign of discipleship. Under these influences, the death of forms must
eventuate leaving the disciple free; the dissolution of old group structures of
thought, embodying worn-out ideas and ideals must necessarily supervene;
crystallised old forms must dissolve and disappear, but in their place the
undying spirit—impressed by revelation and sensitive to the emerging new
concepts of truth—will create the needed new forms of appropriate
expression.
Such are the influences which today are dominating the world, finding
expression according to the type of vehicle which reacts to their impact. The
type of conscious response and resultant activity is—as the occultist well knows—dependent upon the quality of the vehicle which is receptive to the
approach of any type of energy. The interplay of the energy and the vehicle
then produces consciousness of some kind. This is a basic and unalterable
law.
In the few things which I have been able to say anent these constellations and
their relation to our planet at this time, I trust I have made clear and practical
something which esoteric astrologers need unceasingly to grasp—the fact that
once it has been established which constellations are at any one time
influencing our Earth, which planets—exoteric and esoteric—are transmitting
their influence and which rays are consequently active, it should be possible
to prove then the fact of these distributed energies by the appearance upon
Earth and among men of their appropriate results, and the expected response.
[548] 2. Three major planetary influences today.
Within the solar system itself, three of the sacred planets are peculiarly active.
They are:
1. Uranus . This planet is the exoteric ruler of Aquarius; it is also the esoteric
ruler of Libra and the hierarchical ruler of Aries. It is peculiarly active at this
time and brings in the energy of the seventh ray. The circulating of its
energies can be portrayed by the following symbol or diagram: This triple inflow of seventh ray energy, coloured by the force of three great
constellations, is potent to effect major changes in our little planet. It is
interesting to realise that Aries, the Inaugurator, is rendered effective on the Earth through the organising potency of Uranus. Aries is the source, the
beginning and the initiator of the New Age and its coming civilisations, of the
appearance of the kingdom of God on earth and also of the individual initiate
into the Mysteries. Aquarius is the present Determiner of the future. That
which is now initiated in Aries will become manifested in Aquarius, and
Libra will enforce the achievement of a point of balance or (esoterically
speaking) of the “escape from opposing forces at the midway point between
the source and the goal.”
2. Mercury is the expression of fourth ray energy and this is, as you know,
peculiarly related to the fourth [549] kingdom in nature, the human kingdom.
It is the esoteric ruler of Aries (hence it “leads into the mysteries”) and is also
the exoteric ruler of Gemini, which is the sign of the major opposites as far as
humanity is concerned, because it signifies soul and personality,
consciousness and form; it is also the exoteric ruler of Virgo, the Mother of
the Christ-Child, or the form and that which indwells the form. It is, finally,
the hierarchical ruler of Scorpio, which is the sign of discipleship.
This, therefore, brings into a close relation four great constellations, each of
which has a peculiar relation to the dualities with which man has a definite
evolutionary concern. These are expressed in a unique manner for humanity
through Aries, Gemini, Virgo, and Scorpio and the following diagram is
descriptive of the nature of that relation: When visualising these diagrams, the symbol should be seen in rapid
revolution. Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, carries to humanity a certain
type of force and this precipitates a point of crisis; it brings about the next great revolution which will lead mankind on to new experience, and to the
revelation of the divinity which it is the destiny of man to reveal.
3. Saturn . This planet applies the tests and is so chosen or invoked because
the third ray is not only its particular ray but is also the ray of our planet, the
Earth. The two notes synchronise. Saturn is also the hierarchical ruler [550]
of Libra and, therefore, it brings to the manifestation of mankind and to the
various hierarchies involved, a point of crisis to which the clue and the
outcome lies in the recognition of balance . As Saturn also controls Capricorn
in two of its three expressions or fields of influence, it is powerful in the three
fields—exoteric, esoteric and hierarchical—and if you will relate what I here
say to what I have said in an earlier part of this treatise re Capricorn, you will
see how the sign of initiation hovers over our planet as well as over the
destiny of the individual disciple. You have therefore an expression of the
third ray force which the following diagram makes clear: Saturn rules one of the decanates of Aquarius. This makes factual and clear that at this time, the signs of balance and of
initiation can be intelligently used to produce effects on our Earth and this
they will immutably do. These statements conclude what I feel it necessary to say at this time.
Initiation—characterised by self-initiation—is the demand of man today. The
stars declare it and decree it. The Hierarchy therefore intentionally
collaborates. The crying demand and aspirations of man indicate appreciation
of the opportunity and recognised understanding of the proved necessity. The
Spirit of Life enforces this. CHAPTER VI - The Three Crosses
[553] I shall not be able to handle the subject of the three zodiacal Crosses—
the Mutable, Fixed and Cardinal Crosses—in any detail, owing to the fact that
they are concerned with the wholes or with the syntheses of manifestation and
with the unified experience of an incarnating entity, be it God or man. They
can, therefore, be truly comprehended only by those with an inclusive
consciousness, i.e., with an initiate-awareness. Some general comments can,
however, be made.
These three Crosses are as you know:
1. The Cross of the Hidden Christ —The Mutable Cross.
a. This is the Cross of the four major energies which produce the
conditioning circumstances which transform animal man into an
aspirant.
b. It is, therefore, the Cross of the personality or of the steadily developing
and finally integrating human being. This takes place at first in response
to circumstance and later to soul inclination.
c. It is the Cross of temporal and temporary change, of fluidity and of
those constantly altering environments which drive the soul within the
form from one extreme of experience to another, so that the life shuttles
between the pairs of opposites. [554]
d. It is the Cross of the responsive form, nurturing and developing the life
of the indwelling Christ, the hidden Soul or Lord of Being.
The four arms of this Cross are Gemini—Virgo—Sagittarius—Pisces. It is
sometimes called the Common Cross because it conditions the common
herd, the mass of humanity.
2. The Cross of the Crucified Christ —The Fixed Cross.
a. This is the Cross composed of the four energies which condition the life
of the man who is first a probationary disciple and then an accepted or
pledged disciple. b. It is outstandingly the Cross of the soul. The man who is upon the Fixed
Cross is becoming increasingly aware of its direction and influences
and does not respond as blindly as does the man upon the Mutable
Cross. He does not “mount this Cross of Right Direction” in a technical
sense until he has attained some measure of soul contact and has had
some touch of illumination and of spiritual intuition—no matter how
fleeting that touch may have been.
c. It is the Cross of “fixed vision and of that immovable intent which
draws the man from points of light to blazing solar radiance.” The man
upon the Fixed Cross says: “I am the soul and here I stand. Naught shall
remove my feet from off the narrow place whereon I stand. I face the
light. I am the Light and in that light shall I see Light.”
d. It is the Cross whose four energies blend with [555] and transmit the
energies of the solar system itself. This it can do because the man upon
the Fixed Cross is becoming increasingly conscious of issues which are
larger than himself, more engrossing than his previous interests and
which concern humanity in its relation to the solar forces and not just to
the planetary forces. He is becoming sensitive to a larger whole.
e. The energies of this Cross continue to evoke response until the time of
the third initiation.
The four arms of this Cross are Taurus—Leo—Scorpio—Aquarius. It is
called the Fixed Cross because the man is stretched upon it by the
directed choice and immovable intent of his soul. From that decision
there is no turning back.
3. The Cross of the Risen Christ —The Cardinal Cross.
a. This is the Cross whereon, under the occult paradox and in time and
space, the Spirit is crucified. Its four energies govern and direct the soul
as it moves forward upon the Path of Initiation. Necessarily, as it deals
with so exalted a state of consciousness, there is but little I can say
anent this Cross except the vaguest generalities.
b. It is, therefore, pre-eminently the Cross of Initiation and of
“beginnings.” It concerns fundamentally “the beginning of the endless Way of Revelation” which starts when Nirvana is entered and for which
all the previous stages of the Path of Evolution have been but
preparatory.
The following quotation may carry understanding and help to illumine this
most difficult [556] subject, indicating the significance of this Cardinal
Cross as a consummating influence and revealing that which lies ahead
of those who attain hierarchical standing:
“All beauty, all goodness, all that makes for the eradication of sorrow and
ignorance upon the Earth must be devoted to the Great Consummation.
Then when the Lords of Compassion shall have spiritually civilised the
Earth and made of it a Heaven, there shall be revealed to the Pilgrims
the Endless Path which reaches to the Heart of the Universe. Man, then
no longer man, will transcend nature and impersonally, yet consciously,
in at-one-ment with all Enlightened Ones, help to fulfil the Law of the
Higher Evolution, of which Nirvana is but the beginning,” (Tibetan
Yoga and Secret Doctrines. Page 12.)
c. It is the Cross of the “widespread arms, the open heart and the higher
mind,” for those who lie upon this Cross know and enjoy the
significances underlying the words: Omnipresence and Omniscience,
and are in process of unfolding the higher phases of Being which we
inadequately cover by the word, Omnipotence.
d. The energies of the Cardinal Cross blend with the energies to which we
can give no greater name than cosmic energy even though that word is
meaningless. They carry the quality of the One about Whom Naught
may be Said and are “tinctured with the Light of the seven solar
systems” of which our solar system is one.
e. The scope and cycle of its influence in the life of the initiate is utterly
unknown even to our planetary [557] Logos Who is Himself stretched
upon its “widespread arms.” 1. The Cross of the Hidden Christ.
Speaking generally, therefore, the Mutable Cross governs the form or body
nature, controls the whole life cycle of the individual soul through the stages of the lower experiences of humanity, the strictly human stages, and the
integrating processes of personality development until the man stands forth as
an aligned person, slowly reorienting himself to a higher vision, a wider
horizontal and vertical grasp of reality and thus becomes the aspirant. This
Cross governs the lower triad in manifestation and rules in the three worlds of
human evolution. The Fixed Cross governs the soul which is now conscious
within the human form and in the three worlds, but controls throughout what
is called “the five worlds of human attainment”—the three strictly human
levels of activity and the two superhuman, i.e., the lower trinity and the
Spiritual Triad. It deals with the entire life of soul experience and expression
after the Mutable Cross has effectively forced the man on to the Path of
Purification and of Discipleship. It is concerned with the integration of soul
and personality and their complete blending or fusion. The Cardinal Cross
governs the manifestation of the Monad in all its glory and beauty, and this
cycle of influence falls into two stages: the one in which the Monad expresses
itself upon the six planes of manifestation in “wisdom, strength and beauty”
through the medium of the integrated soul and personality. This is a relatively
brief stage. Second, the stage wherein—withdrawn and abstracted from those
forms of Being—”the ONE proceeds upon the higher Way and passes on to
[558] realms unknown e’en to the highest of the Sons of God upon our
Earth.”
It might be added that the Mutable Cross is the conditioning influence in that
great planetary centre which we call the human; that the Fixed Cross is
paramountly the major controlling set of energies governing, and being
transmitted by, the centre which we call the planetary Hierarchy; whilst the
Cardinal Cross rules and conditions (in a manner unknown to men) that great
planetary centre to which we give the name Shamballa.
You will see, therefore, how stupendous is my theme. Only those, may I again
repeat, who can think in terms of one or other of the three above Wholes, will
know whereof I speak; lesser minds will get a general picture or vision of
transcendental possibilities which will aid them to an expansion of
consciousness, but what I say will remain far-off in the realm of the
(temporarily) unattainable. Will it clarify the subject technically and academically if I point out that—
1. The Mutable Cross is the Cross of the Holy Spirit, of the third Person of the
Christian Trinity, as it organises substance and evokes sensitive response from
substance itself.
2. The Fixed Cross is the Cross of the Son of God, of the second Person of the
Trinity, driven through love to incarnate in matter and to be consciously
crucified upon the Cross of matter.
3. The Cardinal Cross is the Cross of the Father, the first aspect of the sacred
Trinity, Who sent forth the Holy Spirit (the Breath) because the Mind of God
visioned a destiny for matter which had been long in coming. [559] Now that
the “time was at hand,” the Son fulfilled the law in cooperation with the Holy
Spirit and this in response to the fiat of the Father.
These three Crosses are, in their totality of manifestation, related to the three
basic energies which brought the solar system into being; they constitute the
three major and synthetic expressions of the supernal Will, motivated by love
and expressed through activity. Upon these Crosses, the ability to see the
Whole, purpose-motive-expression, life-quality-appearance, shifts and
changes. Upon the Mutable Cross , the crucified man sees naught of the
picture. He suffers, agonises, desires, strives, is the apparent victim of
circumstances, and is distinguished by a veiled vision and inchoate longings.
These gradually take shape until he reaches the stage of acquiescence and
aspiration . Then he finds himself upon the Fixed Cros s and begins to grasp
the whole of the purpose of experience upon the Mutable Cross (as far as
humanity is concerned) and to realise that there is a hierarchical purpose
which can only be grasped by the man who is willing to be crucified upon that
Cross. He reaches the stage of responsibility, self-awareness and right
direction. His orientation is now “the spiritually vertical which involves the
inclusive horizontal.” At this stage, the Plan of the Logos begins to take shape
in his consciousness. Upon the Cardinal Cross , the purpose and the unified
consummations of the two earlier crucifixions become almost blindingly
apparent and a vision of the unified intent of the three Persons of the
underlying Trinity (each upon His Own Cross) emerges with clarity. Perhaps the simplicity of the following three symbols may serve somewhat to
clarify that which I have tried to impart. [560]
The Mutable Cross of material change and constant movement can be
depicted by the swastika. The man is unconscious of the nature of the four entering energies and
interprets little in terms of the soul. The energies make their impact upon him
and drive him into material activity. This Cross of the personality dedicates
the man who is crucified thereon to material ends in order that he may learn
eventually their divine use. It is in the lower aspect of this Cross that the
Nazis chose this symbol as theirs; they were expressing, at the close of the
material cycle of human existence, the false and evil use of matter, of which
separativeness, cruelty and selfishness is the key. The misuse of substance and
the prostitution of matter and form to evil ends is the sin against the Holy
Spirit. It might be said that the swastika “drives into danger dire and into evil
ways, those whose greed is great and who see no beauty in the dawning light
and who know no love of human lives.” To those who respond not to the
lower aspects and effects of the whirling Cross (as it is sometimes called) “the
swastika flings them from itself and far afield until they come to rest upon the
Cross of chosen crucifixion,” the Fixed Cross of the pledged disciple.
The symbol of the Fixed Cross (as far as humanity is concerned) might be
depicted thus: Here you have the [561] Cross of Humanity. On this Cross, the man is
illumined and conscious of the effects of the completed cycle (indicated by
the circle) of the four energies to which he was subjected upon the Mutable
Cross.
The symbol for the Cardinal Cross is more complicated and can be portrayed
thus: Here you have the triangle of manifested Monad, plus the three cycles of four
energies, focussed and blended in unity; you have also the line of evolution
(the evolution of consciousness) going down deep into, and becoming
inclusive of matter and at the same time reaching out into the “Spaces of
Divinity.”
Much that can be said anent the three Crosses has been already covered in
scattered form when dealing separately with each of the twelve signs of the
zodiac; it need not here be repeated. This Treatise, like The Secret Doctrine ,
is designed to instigate research and the power to delve and seek, because that
process has a definite effect upon the cells of the brain and leads to a needed
stimulation. In the study of the Crosses, the true meaning of their influence
will only appear as you begin to think in terms of synthesis or of the relation
of the four streams of energy, flowing unitedly upon and through any form of
divine manifestation. This is by no means an easy thing to do, for the ability
to think synthetically is only just beginning to appear in the foremost minds of
the race. It can be illustrated, and then only analytically (which ever negates
synthesis) by remarking in connection with the Mutable Cross, for instance, that the [562] synthesis of evolution, its problem and its goal all appear in a
united, whole presentation when the influences are viewed as follows:
1. Gemini—the presentation of duality.
2. Virgo—the presentation of blending life and form.
3. Sagittarius—the presentation of focussed energy. Júpiter . Pisces—the presentation of a blended radiance.
This culminating radiance is the result of the focus of life, intention, and
energy into a “radiant point of power.” You have been told that in connection
with the Mutable Cross at this time the sign Pisces is the most potent and
when the work of the Mutable Cross has been accomplished, the acquiescing
disciple passes onto the Fixed Cross and prepares for the tests and trials of
initiation. This is expressed for us in the occult symbology of the Old
Commentary as follows:
“The Light shines forth because the greater light and the lesser light
approach and then invoke each other. Their blended lights, though not yet
one radiant sun, are merging fast. These blended lights reveal the Lighted
Way.
The man beholds himself taking this other Way, the Way of lighted
wholes; this leads from form to soul, from dark to light and thus around the
Wheel. Retracing thus his steps and backward moving on the Way (the
reversed wheel of the zodiac, A.A.B.) he forward moves.
A new light enters in. The Seven Sisters play their part (the Pleiades are
in Taurus, the first sign of the Fixed Cross) and then three lights shine forth.
And thus one radiant sun appears.”
[563] The theme of all three Crosses is fusion and integration. The fusion of
the personality into one functioning whole; the fusion of soul and personality
consciously; the fusion of the threefold expression of divinity—Monad, ego
and personality—so that there is an appearance of the blended energies. The
keynote of their influences is the power to include and the full expression
simultaneously, in time and space, of the vertical and the horizontal life. It should be noted that there are seven forms of light, related to the substance
of the seven planes. These are stimulated and enhanced by the twelve forms
of light of the twelve Creative Hierarchies, related each of them to one or
other of the twelve signs of the zodiac. On this I may not enlarge as it
concerns the mysteries of the higher initiations. I simply make the statement
so that it may be appreciated by you as an occult fact to the proof of which
you may not yet have access. A paralleling statement would be that the light
of the seven centres in man (when enhanced by the light of the seven
planetary centres) and the five kingdoms in nature (7+5=12), plus the twelve
lights of the zodiac will produce a consummation of “light” effectiveness
which will make possible the expression of the whole. This, through the
medium of humanity. This is a basic statement which means little to you as
yet but which will—in the next century—form a seed thought or “key sound”
for the next revelation of the Ageless Wisdom.
Until the significance of the three Crosses is understood more fully and
synthetically by astrologers and astrological investigators, it is almost
impossible to find the needed words which will convey clearly the intended
meaning. There has been no real attempt as yet on the part of astrologers
(even the most advanced) to arrive at a general or synthetic understanding of
the effect of the Crosses [564] upon humanity. All that has as yet been
conveyed is the effect of one arm of the Cross upon the subject born in a
particular sign. But there is a fusion of energies to be noted when, esoterically
speaking, man “stands at the midway point where the four energies meet.”
The man whose Sun sign is in Gemini, for instance, is subjected to the forces
flowing through the Cross as whole, unless he is a very low grade human
being; he will be sensitive to the influences of the other three signs when they
sweep into power as the lesser zodiac of the year plays its part. Later, when
the practical value of esoteric astrology is better understood, men will avail
themselves of the three energies of the three other signs of the Cross in which
the Sun sign finds a place. This is a future development of the science of
esoteric astrology. Putting it into the simplest terms and thereby necessarily
limiting significances, a man will endeavour, when in Sagittarius, to practise
one-pointedness along some one line; when in Virgo, he will know that opportunity to bring the form more under the influence of the hidden Christ is
possible and that, in Pisces, sensitivity to the higher impression is his right
and privilege. All these four possibilities, in regard to the advanced initiate are
beautifully demonstrated for us in the life of Jesus, the Master on the sixth
ray.
The Gemini aspect of His life is shown in the perfect fusion of the basic
duality found in humanity: the human and the divine.
The Virgo aspect came into expression in His twelfth year when He said:
“Wist ye not that I must be about My Father’s business,” thereby indicating
the subordination of the form life to the will of the indwelling Christ; this was
consummated when “divinity descended upon Him” at the Baptism.
[565] The Sagittarian energy enabled Him to say, when confronted with full
knowledge of the imminent sacrifice which He would have to make: “I must
go up to Jerusalem,” and, we read, He then “set His face” and trod the Path of
the Saviour, leading to the liberation of humanity.
The Piscean aspect in its highest expression is demonstrated by His
sensitivity to immediate and unbroken contact with His “Father in Heaven”;
He was in constant communication with the Monad, thereby proving to the
world that He was initiated into states of consciousness of which the third
initiation is but the beginning.
All the three Crosses are shown as functioning simultaneously in His life—a
thing hitherto unknown in the perfection which He displayed—a perfection of
perfect responsiveness and perfect demonstration of result as well, giving us a
manifestation and an example of the fusion of the twelve energies in one
divine Personality (expressing Individuality) on the physical plane. Let me
briefly complete the demonstration of this truth—the truth that in the initiate
of the higher degrees, all the twelve zodiacal energies can focus
simultaneously and produce a complete exhibition of divinity, as it is intended
eventually to express itself through humanity on this planet. I have given you
the expression of the Mutable Cross. We will take the other two, in connection
with the Christ and with the Cosmic Christ.
THE FIXED CROSS Taurus.—Christ said (as have all the Sons of God Who know the true
significance of the Fixed Cross), “I am the Light of the world,” and he
added, “if thine eye be single thy whole body shall he full of light.”
Taurus is, as you have heard, the Mother of Illumination, and [566] the
“eye of the Bull” is the symbol of the eye to which Christ made
reference.
Leo.—This is the sign of self-conscious identity. This is testified to by
Christ in the words He spoke to His disciples: “What shall it profit a
man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul?” or his own centre of
self-consciousness—that significant point of attainment which must
precede all the more inclusive states of consciousness.
Scorpio.—The significance of this sign in the life of Christ has been
deleted from The New Testament , but has been preserved for us in the
ancient Christian legend that—in the cradle itself—Christ killed or
strangled two serpents, thus referring to the pairs of opposites which
could no longer control Him.
Aquarius.—The expression of this influence has been beautifully given to
us in the story of the Last Supper. Christ sent His disciples into the city
to find the man “bearing a pitcher of water” upon his shoulder. This is
the symbol of the sign Aquarius—the sign in which the universality of
the water of life will become a factor in human consciousness; then we
shall indeed all sit down eventually to the communion of bread and
wine. He referred indirectly to the same idea when He spoke of Himself
as the “water of life,” assuaging the thirst of humanity.
Thus, through the use of the energies of these four signs of the Fixed Cross,
Christ demonstrated perfection. [567]
THE CARDINAL CROSS
In the four signs of this Cross we find Him also manifesting their energies in
their highest forms (from the angle of human understanding), though these are
more by implication than by direct statement.
Aries.—This sign, which is the sign of beginnings, provided the impulse
and energy which enabled Him to inaugurate the Christian era; it initiated, through Him, the “age of Love” which is only now beginning
to take form, and its potency is now so great that it has brought about
(paradoxically) the present world cleavage.
Cancer.—The potency of this sign is expressed for us by Christ in the oft
misinterpreted words: “Other sheep I have which are not of this fold,
them also I must bring.” This refers to the mass consciousness in
contradistinction to the initiate consciousness of His disciples. Cancer is
a mass sign.
Libra.—Christ stood at the point of balance in human evolution; He stood
between the old world and the new, between the East and the West. In
the Christian era comes a “point of balance” or that “crisis of
equilibrium” in the human kingdom.
Capricorn.—This sign marks the point of concretion and of crystallisation
which results eventually in the death of the form. This we see
happening today. In His triumph over death and in His resurrection into
life, Christ indicated the deep mystery of Capricorn.
[568] A study of these few suggestions anent the life of Christ will bring to
light and livingness this whole subject of the three Crosses. It is needless for
me to remind you at this point that on Mount Golgotha, these three Crosses
are portrayed:
1. The Mutable Cross—the unrepentant thief. Humanity.
2. The Fixed Cross—the repentant thief. Hierarchy.
3. The Cardinal Cross—the Cross of Christ. Shamballa. 2. The Cross of the Crucified Christ.
For those who read this treatise, the Cross which is of prime importance is the
Fixed Cross of the Heavens. Aspirants to the Mysteries are steadily increasing
in numbers at this time and this involves their re-orientation towards the
Light, their conscious reversal upon the wheel of the zodiac, and their
comprehension of the objectives of the processes to which they have given
themselves upon the Fixed Cross. Disciples are apt to think that the fact of
their taking their place upon that Cross and demonstrating their willingness to be tested and to show unalterable stability is the major factor involved. This is
by no means so in reality. Each of these Crosses makes its presence felt as a
fourfold sphere of influence or a potent centre of energy through the medium
of an “invoking sound.” This sound goes up from each of the Crosses and
produces a result and a response from some source. It is this new fact anent
the Crosses which is of importance and upon which I seek briefly to touch.
Only when the influence of all the four arms of each Cross has produced an
effect in the subject is a transition in consciousness made from one Cross to
another—each transition marking a point of crisis, both in [569] the
individual and in the larger whole. Then a process of invocation is instituted
—at first unconsciously, in which case it is in the nature of a diffused call,
and, later, consciously, when it takes the form of a focussed appeal.
When the time of transition from the Mutable Cross on to the Fixed Cross
arrives, three things occur:
1. The influence of the four energies of the Mutable Cross have brought
about a vast experience of life in form.
2. There is now a gradually growing and profound dissatisfaction
awakening in the consciousness of the man making the transition. He
has exhausted material desire to a very great extent and is no longer
attracted by the Path of outgoing into matter; the needs of the physical
nature no longer dominate him; he is afraid of the impulses, emanating
from the astral plane; he is awake and active mentally and as a
functioning personality. But he remains unsatisfied and is
uncomfortably aware of it.
3. He turns to invocation. This process of invocation falls into two stages:
a. The stage of aspiration, irregular and vague but gradually assuming
power.
b. The stage of mysticism, merging into occultism (the study of that
which is hidden). Duality is now consciously and uncomfortably
recognised and the higher way and the spiritual vision is contacted.
Desire gives place to the vague promptings of what might be called
love. This is the movement in the personality of that divine emerging aspect. It is this that he seeks to invoke. When this is adequately
strong then true evocation [570] takes place and the disciple (for
such the man now is) mounts the Fixed Cross.
The above is true of the individual disciple and also today of humanity as a
whole, and—as I have oft told you—it is this process of invocation which is
taking place in the human family. This produces the present dire crisis. The
two stages above outlined are present today in a general and potent sense in
mankind.
It was the recognition of these two stages in humanity which led me, under
instruction from the Hierarchy, to give out—at widely separated points in time
—two stanzas of a great occult mantram. The first stanza, used in 1936,
referred to the vague general aspiration of the mass of the people in the world,
which is today more pronounced than ever before and becoming more
focussed towards true well-being.
THE GREAT INVOCATION
Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.
Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.
May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.
May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.
Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.
So let it be, and help us to do our part.
The use of this first stanza was immediately successful and met with a full
response from those good and well-meaning people whose focus is
predominantly astral and aspirational, and whose aim is peace and quiet. This
peace and quiet provides the “area of consciousness” in which aspiration can
flourish, physical and emotional comfort can be attained and the recognition
of the mystical vision becomes possible.
[571] The second stanza was given out later and was intended to be a test and
a “decision point in a time of crisis.”
Let the Lords of Liberation issue forth.
Let Them bring succour to the sons of men. Let the Rider from the Secret Place come forth,
And coming, save.
Come forth, O Mighty One.
Let the souls of men awaken to the Light,
And may they stand with massed intent.
Let the fiat of the Lord go forth:
The end of woe has come!
Come forth, O Mighty One.
The hour of service of the saving force has now arrived.
Let it be spread abroad, O Mighty One.
Let Light and Love and Power and Death
Fulfil the purpose of the Coming One.
The WILL to save is here.
The LOVE to carry forth the work is widely spread abroad.
The ACTIVE AID of all who know the truth is also here.
Come forth, O mighty One, and blend these three.
Construct a great defending wall.
The rule of evil NOW must end. It was offered, under this test, to the masses, but was intended primarily for
the use of those aspirants and disciples who are not only mystics but who
have made at least some small progress in their attempt to tread the occult
way. They are mentally focussed in their attitude; the higher way is
recognised by them; the vision has been seen and they are now ready for
something closer and more real. The last stanza given is primarily, therefore,
for the use of those who have mounted, or are in process of mounting, the
Fixed Cross.
It is for this reason that the use of the second part of [572] the Great
Invocation was relatively limited. It was repudiated (almost violently
sometimes) by the emotional type of person who could see no further than the
beauty of peace—the goal of expression upon the astral plane. Their vision of
the greater whole and of the evocation of the will -to-good (which is not the
will -to-peace) was exceedingly limited and this through no fault of their own.
It simply indicated their place upon the ladder of evolution and marked a
relatively useful point of service, but one which is in process of being
transcended. The people in the world today are coming to realise (through
suffering and its consequent reflection) that there is something greater than peace and that is the good of the whole , and not just individual, peaceful
conditions or national peace. This re-orientation of the human consciousness
is brought about by the determined attitude of the souls of men, massed and
blended, organised and focussed by the vision of the general welfare of
humanity.
It was, however, essential that these distinctions in attitude should appear in
their clarity and, therefore, we gave out the two stanzas of the Great
Invocation separately and at different times. You learnt thereby the difference
of attitude between the mass of well-meaning people in the world, and the
correctly oriented attitudes of the intelligent aspirants and disciples. This was
necessary before wider action could later take place. I would pause here and
remind you that both groups are necessary: the first group—emotional and
idealistic—have a part to play in focussing the mass fluid aspiration. Their
responsibility is to the general public. The other group of trained thinkers and
people who are animated primarily by the will -to-good (which is of more
importance in this world cycle than the will -to-peace) have a function to
carry out in evoking hierarchical response in [573] reply to the aspiration of
the first group. They focus this aspiration on the mental plane, create a
thoughtform embodying the objective and project the “call” which may reach
the ears of the Lords of Liberation.
The blended invocation and the united call from the different levels of the
human consciousness will bring a mighty appeal to bear upon the hidden
Centres of the “Saving Force.” It is this united appeal which you must now
organise. Thus the mass of humanity will be stimulated to move off the
Mutable Cross on to the Fixed Cross and the new world cycle, beginning in
Aquarius (one arm of the Fixed Cross) will be definitely inaugurated by
humanity itself.
It might be said, therefore, that the Great Invocation as first given out was for
the use of those who are crucified upon the Mutable Cross, the Cross of
change, whilst the second invocation is for the use of those who are crucified
upon the Fixed Cross, the Cross of right orientation. It is for the use of those
men and women whose aim is the will -to-good, who think in terms of world service and who are oriented towards light—the light of knowledge, the light
of wisdom and understanding and the light of life itself.
Upon the Fixed Cross, the united influence of its four streams of energy, when
expressing themselves fully through an individual disciple and through the
Hierarchy, produces likewise three emerging conditions:
1. There is a vast experience of group life, group activity and group
awareness. The self-conscious man in Leo becomes the group
conscious man in Aquarius.
2. There arises in the consciousness of the disciple a vision of the “endless
Way of which Nirvana is but the beginning.” [574]
3. He recognises his task of mediatorship which is the major task of the
Hierarchy, mediating between Shamballa and Humanity. He knows that
he must carry forward the dual task of invocation and evocation
simultaneously—the evocation (through right invocation) of the will-togood of the world thinkers and aspirants, and also the will-to-save of
the Shamballa Lords, via the Hierarchy, which he is in a position
directly to approach. I touch here on grave mysteries.
There awakens in him, therefore, a vague determination at first which gives
place in time to an evocation of the will in himself. This eventually puts him
en rapport with the will aspect of Deity as it emanates and is stepped down
from Shamballa, via the Hierarchy, into which spiritual organisation he is
being gradually integrated through experience upon the Fixed Cross. It might
here be pointed out that:
a. Experience upon the Mutable Cross integrates a man into the centre
which we call Humanity.
b. Experience upon the Fixed Cross integrates the disciple into the second
planetary Centre which we call the Hierarchy.
c. Experience upon the Cardinal Cross integrates the initiate into the
primary planetary Centre to which we give the name Shamballa.
He eventually becomes a radiating centre of spiritual will, affecting humanity
and evoking its will-to-good; he blends this into the Hierarchy as far as he can, fusing this human will into hierarchical activity in an effort to evoke
response from Shamballa. [575] 3. The Cross of the Risen Christ.
More upon this subject I may not give to you, nor will it profit for me to
enlarge upon the conditions which emerge in the consciousness of the initiate
upon the Cardinal Cross. My words would be meaningless. Most of you are in
the transition state wherein you are stabilising your individual will, and are
attempting increasingly to express it in the will-to-good. I would have you
deeply realise that if the will-to-peace is conditioning you, then you are still
working on emotional levels and your work will then have to be with the first
stanza of the Great Invocation and with its distribution to the masses. If it is
the will-to-good which influences and directs you, then to the awakening of
mass aspiration you must add the task of evoking the response to world need
in the thinkers and aspirants through the medium of the second stanza,
blending the two approaches in an effort to evoke—via the Hierarchy—the
will-to-save of Shamballa. CHAPTER VII - The Rays, Constellations
and Planets
(As per Tabulation X)
[579] We come now to our last discussion upon the zodiac and its relation
to the seven rays. We have been occupied with the signs and their effects,
and with the new and deeply esoteric astrology which will gradually
supersede the present mundane astrology. By the end of this century, it will
have won its rightful place in human thought. One thing you must
constantly bear in mind. Now that the war is over, and that time of acute
trial and tribulation has come to an end, a great spiritual awakening (of a
quality and a nature quite unpredictable today) will arrive. The war will
have taught humanity many lessons and have torn the veil of self away from
many eyes. Values which have been hitherto expressed and understood only
by those whose “eyes are on God” will be the goal and the desire of untold
thousands; true understanding between men and between nations will be a
longed for objective. What humanity determines to have, it ever succeeds in
achieving. This is an occult law, for desire is as yet the strongest force in the
world; organised , unified desire was the basic reason for the appalling early
successes of the Axis. The only factor which can successfully oppose desire
is Will, using the word in its spiritual connotation and as an expression of
the first great divine aspect. There was little of that organised, spiritual will
shown by the [580] allies; they were animated naturally by desire for
victory, desire for the arrival of the end of this all-engulfing world
cataclysm, by desire for peace and the return of stability, the desire to end
war once and for all and to break its constantly recurring cycle, and a
steadily mounting desire to bring to a finish the terrible toll of suffering, of
cruelty, of death, of starvation and of fear which is gripping humanity by the
throat in the attempt to strangle out its life. 1. The Nature of the Will––Underlying Cosmic
Purpose. But all this determination is in most cases simply the expression of a fixed
and united desire. It is not the organised use of the will. The secret of the
will lies in the recognition of the divine nature of man. Only this can evoke
the true expression of the will. It has in fact to be evoked by the soul, as it
dominates the human mind and controls the personality. The secret of the
will is also closely tied in with the recognition of the unconquerable nature
of goodness and the inevitability of the ultimate triumph of good. This is not
determination; it is not whipping up and stimulating desire so that it can be
transmuted into will; it is not an implacable, unshakable, immovable
focussing of all energies in the need to triumph (the enemies of the Forces
of Light are adept at that). Victory for the allies did lie in the effort to
produce this focussing with better effect than the enemy. The use of the will
is not expressed by an iron fixation to stand steady and not yield to evil
forces. Determination, the focussing of energy and the demonstration of an
all-out effort towards victory were only (where the allies are concerned) the
expression of a one-pointed desire for peace and for an ending of [581] the
trouble. This type of effort is something which the masses can give and
which they did give on both sides in this conflict.
There is, however, a plus, a something else, which swung the tide of victory
on to the side of the Allies. It came through an unrealized effort to
understand and express the quality of spiritual Will; it was the manifestation
of that divine energy which made the first divine aspect of will or power
what it is; it is that which is the distinctive feature of the Shamballa force; it
is that peculiar and distinctive quality of divinity which is so different that
even Christ Himself was unable to express it with facility and
understanding. Hence we have the episode in Gethsemane. It is not easy for
me to express its significance in words. Two thousand years have gone since
Gethsemane and since Christ made His initial contact with the Shamballa
force and by this means, and on behalf of humanity, established a
relationship which even at the close of twenty centuries is but a thin frail
line of connecting energy. This Shamballa force is nevertheless available for right usage but the power
to express it lies in its understanding (as far as may be possible at this
midway point in human evolution) and its group use. It is a unifying,
synthetic force, but can be used as a regimenting, standardising force. May I
repeat those two key words to the use of the Shamballa energy: Group Use
and Understanding.
Mankind has had much difficulty in comprehending the significance of
Love. If that is so, their problem in relation to the Will will naturally be still
more difficult. For the vast majority of men, true love is still only a theory.
Love (as we usually interpret it) works out as kindness but it is kindness to
the form side of life, to the personalities of those around us, and fulfils itself
usually in a desire to carry [582] out our obligations and not to obstruct in
any way those activities and relationships which tend to the well-being of
our fellowmen. It expresses itself in a desire to end abuses and to bring
about happier, material, world conditions; it shows itself in mother love, in
love among friends, but seldom as yet as love among groups and nations. It
is the theme of the Christian teaching, just as Will, divinely expressed, will
be the theme of the coming world religion and has been the impulse lying
behind much of the good work done in the fields of philanthropy and human
welfare, but, factually, love has never yet been expressed—except by the
Christ.
You might ask, why, if this is so, do you emphasise this highest divine
aspect? Why not wait until we know more about love and how to manifest it
in our environment? Because, in its true expression, the Will today is needed
as a propelling, expulsive force, and also as a clarifying, purifying agent.
The first recorded utterance of the Christ was spoken to His mother (the
symbol of the substance aspect of divinity) when He said: “Wist ye not that
I must be about My Father’s business?” That business, related by Him to the
first divine aspect, the Monad or Father aspect, was the fulfilment of
purpose and the carrying out of the intention, the will and the purpose of
God. His second utterance came at the time of the Baptism in Jordan when
He said to John, the Baptist: “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.” Here, in this second initiation—which
symbolises the conquest of desire—He passes on into the realm of
fulfilment, of the completion of planned righteous activity. For His Own
personal desire (necessarily of the very highest order on account of His high
point in evolution) He substitutes the divine Will. Again at [583] the close
of His life, in the Gethsemane experience, He cries out: “Father, not my will
but Thine be done.” Even then and even for Him, the achievement of the
full expression of will seemed well-nigh impossible; He was conscious still
of the inherent dualism of His position and of the contrast between His will
and God’s will. In these three utterances, He demonstrates His recognition
of the three emerging aspects of the Shamballa life, quality and energy:
1. The Will which conditions the life aspect.
2. The Will which brings fulfilment of right human relations.
3. The Will which finally conquers death.
These three aspects are all related to the three divine expressions of spirit,
soul and body, of life, consciousness and form, of life, quality and
appearance. This phase of Christ’s life expression has never been properly
studied, yet even a little grasp and understanding of it would aid humanity
to drive evil (individual, group and planetary) back to the place from
whence it came and would aid in the release of humanity from the terror
which is today stalking abroad, defying God and man.
The Shamballa energy is, therefore, that which is related to the livingness
(through consciousness and form) of humanity; we need not consider its
relation to the rest of the manifested world; it concerns the establishing of
right human relations and is that condition of being which eventually
negates the power of death. It is, therefore, incentive and not impulse; it is
realised purpose and not the expression of desire. Desire works from and
through the material form upwards ; Will works downwards into form,
bending form consciously to divine purpose. The one [584] is invocative
and the other is evocative. Desire, when massed and focussed, can invoke
will; will, when evoked, ends desire and becomes an immanent, propulsive,
driving force, stabilising, clarifying, and—among other things—finally destroying. It is much more than this, but this is all that man can grasp at
this time and all for which he has, as yet, the mechanism of comprehension.
It is this will—aroused by invocation—which must be focussed in the light
of the soul, and dedicated to the purposes of light and for the purpose of
establishing right human relations which must be used (in love) to destroy
all that is hindering the free flow of human life and that is bringing death
(spiritual and real) to humanity. This Will must be invoked and evoked.
I am not referring here to the use of either of the two Great Invocations or to
the third which has lately been given. I refer to the focussed consciousness
of the men and women of goodwill, whose lives are conditioned by the will
to carry forward the purposes of God in love, who seek selflessly to
understand those purposes, and who are fearless of death.
There are two great handicaps to the free expression of the Shamballa force
in its true nature. One is the sensitivity of the lower nature to its impact and
its consequent prostitution to selfish ends, as in the case of the sensitive,
negative German people and its use by the Axis nations for material
objectives. The second is the blocking, hindering, muddled but massed
opposition of the well-meaning people of the world who talk vaguely and
beautifully about love, but refuse to consider the techniques of the will of
God in operation . According to them, that will is something with which
they personally have naught to do; they refuse to recognise that God works
out His will through men, just [585] as He is ever seeking to express His
love through men; they will not believe that that will could possibly express
itself through the destruction of evil with all the material consequences of
that evil. They cannot believe that a God of Love could possibly employ the
first divine aspect to destroy the forms which are obstructing the free play of
the divine spirit; that will must not infringe upon their interpretation of love.
Such people are individually of small moment and of no importance but
their massed negativity was a real detriment to the ending of this war, just as
the massed negativity of the German people and their inability to take right
action when Hitler’s purposes were disclosed made possible the great inflow
of ancient and focussed evil which has brought the present catastrophe to man. Such people are like a millstone around the neck of humanity,
crippling true effort, murmuring “Let us love God and each other,” but
doing nothing but murmuring prayers and platitudes whilst humanity is
dying.
You can easily appreciate the fact that the evocation of the energy of the will
and its effect upon the unprepared, materialistically minded person might
and would prove a disaster. It would simply serve to focus and strengthen
the lower self-will, which is the name we give to realised and determined
desire. It could then create such a driving force, directed to selfish ends, that
the person might become a monster of wickedness. In the history of the
race, one or two advanced personalities have done this with dire results both
to themselves and to the people of their time. One such figure in ancient
times was Nero; the modern example is Hitler. What, however, has made the
latter so dangerous an enemy of the human family is that during the last two
thousand years mankind has advanced to a point where it can also be
responsive to certain aspects of this first ray [586] force. Hitler, therefore,
found associates and co-operators who added their receptivity to his so that
an entire group became the responsive agents of the destructive energy,
expressing itself in its lowest aspect. This is what enabled them to work
ruthlessly, powerfully, selfishly, cruelly and successfully at the destruction
of all that attempted to impede their projects and desires.
There is only one way in which focussed evil will, with its responsiveness to
the Shamballa force, can be overcome and that is by the opposition of an
equally focussed spiritual will, displayed by responsive men and women of
goodwill who can train themselves to be sensitive to this type of new
incoming energy and can learn how to invoke and evoke it.
You can consequently see why there was more than the casual use of a
current word in my mind when the terms of goodwill and of the will-togood were discussed. All the time, I had in my thoughts not just kindness
and good intention, but the focussed will-to-good which can and must evoke
the Shamballa energy and use it for the arresting of the forces of evil. This, I realise, is a relatively new idea to many of you; to others of you it
will mean little or nothing; others again may have faint glimmerings of this
new approach to God and service which—again I say—can and must
remake, rebuild, and rehabilitate the world. I would like here to point out
that the will aspect can be contacted only from the mental plane and only
those, therefore, who are working with and through the mind can begin to
appropriate this energy. Those who seek to evoke the Shamballa force are
approaching close to the energy of fire. Fire is the symbol and the quality of
the mental plane. Fire is an aspect of the divine nature. Fire was an
outstanding aspect [587] of the war. Fire is produced by physical means and
the aid of the mineral kingdom and this was the great menacing and chosen
means of destruction in this war. This is a fulfilment of the ancient prophecy
that the attempt to destroy the Aryan race will be by means of fire, just as
ancient Atlantis was destroyed by water. But, fiery goodwill and the
conscious focussed use of the Shamballa force can counter fire by fire and
this must be done .
I cannot give you more upon this subject until you have given time to its
consideration and have sought to understand the use of the will, its nature,
purpose and its relation to what you understand by the human will. You
must ponder upon how it should be employed and in what manner aspirants
and disciples who are mentally polarised can focus that will and safely
shoulder the responsibility for its wise use. Later when you know more
about it, I can give you further knowledge upon the matter. I would however
like to make one practical suggestion. Might there not be organised a group
who would take this subject as the theme of their meditation and who would
try to fit themselves—by right understanding —to contact and use the
Shamballa energy? Would it not be possible gradually to elaborate this
theme of the revelation of the divine will so that the general subject may be
ready for presentation to the thinking public when peace truly comes? There
is much to be considered in this connection. There is the demonstration of
the three aspects of the will as enumerated above; there is the preparation of
the individual for the expression of this energy; there is a mature
consideration to be given to the relation of the Hierarchy to Shamballa, carried forward as the Masters attempt to work out divine purpose and to be
the distributing Agents of the will energy. There is the effort to be made to
comprehend somewhat the nature of [588] the direct impact of the first
aspect upon the human consciousness, apart from the hierarchical centre
altogether—an impact made without any of the absorbing and steppingdown process to which the Hierarchy subjects it. I have referred to this
direct contact elsewhere; it can be more direct and complete when there is
greater safety brought about by a more understanding human approach.
One of the causes lying behind World War Gêmeos is to be found in a premature
contact—a contact made by certain selfish minds of a relatively high
quality, aided by the Black Lodge. To offset this and eventually bring about
the elimination of the influence of the dark forces from our planet must
come the active, conscious use of the Shamballa force by the White Lodge,
aided by the men and women whose will-to-good is strong enough to
safeguard them from personal peril in their work and from being deflected
on to wrong and dangerous lines. This aid necessitates a certain definite and
planned contact and interplay between the two centres: Humanity and
Hierarchy. When this is better established, there can be organised and
known cooperation and the members of both great centres can “stand
together with massed intent.” This massed intent will be the correspondence
upon the mental plane of the massed intent of the general public who stand
with the power of appeal upon their lips and in their hearts. To this appeal
must be added the focussed will of the world thinkers and intuitives who
will use their minds and brains in the affirmation of right.
It was for the reason that the will aspect was involved that I made our last
point in our consideration of the seven rays to be a consideration of the
Rays, Constellations and Planets, as given in Tabulation X. The interrelation there given concerns the first aspect of the will, as I have [589] here
indicated. The analysis of this tabulation will complete our consideration of
esoteric astrology.
The seven stars of the Great Bear are the originating sources of the seven
rays of our solar system. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear express Themselves through the medium of the seven planetary Logoi Who are
Their Representatives and to whom they stand in the relation of Prototype.
These seven planetary Spirits manifest through the medium of the seven
sacred planets.
Each of these seven rays, coming from the Great Bear, are transmitted into
our solar system through the medium of three constellations and their ruling
planets. The following tabulation will make this clear, but must be
interpreted only in terms of the present turn of the great zodiacal wheel of
25,000 years. 2. Various Aspects of the Will
We have now the difficult task of considering an aspect of divine
manifestation which is as yet so little apparent upon the physical plane that
we lack the exact word with which to express it and those words available
are likewise misleading. I can, however, attempt to give you certain
concepts, relationships and parallels which may serve to close this section
on astrology and lay a foundation for future teaching around the year 2025.
That is the mode whereby all revelation comes. A thought is given; a
symbol described; an idea portrayed. Then, as the minds of men ponder
upon it and the intuitives of the world pick up the thought, it serves as a
seed thought which eventually comes to fruition with the presentation and
the unfolding of a revelation which serves to lead the race of men nearer to
their goal. [590]

Saturn We are considering the expression of the Shamballa force in terms of Will,
i.e., of divine purpose, latent in the mind of God since the beginning of time
and the dawn of creation. In God’s mind, that idea is seen whole and
complete. In manifestation it is a gradual, self-revealing evolutionary and
demonstrated activity. We know somewhat of the intelligence aspect of God.
It is revealed in the living activity of substance. Of the love of that Great
Thinker, we are learning slowly and its revelation has reached the stage
where the human mind can contrast its [591] mode of living activity with
the visioned and sensed love of Deity, expressed as yet by the desire for
right human relations and right treatment of all that is non-human. Of the
will and purpose of God, humanity knows nothing, for the individual will or
the collective human will which could act as interpreter, revealer and also
serve as a mode of contact, is dedicated to selfishness and blind to the
higher reaches of divine expression. Mankind’s so-called acquiescence in
the will of God is based on his wish life, on his negativity and on the visions
of the saints. Their keynote was submission and their highest point of
spiritual contact was still tinged with dualism and still conditioned by
modes of human interpretation.
Under the occult method, we must begin with the universal and the whole;
in time the individual and the particular will stand revealed, but in relation to the whole. It should be possible, through a study of the seven rays and
their related constellations and their transmitting agents, the planets, to gain
some general idea of the pouring through of the Shamballa energy as
emerging purpose on the physical plane.
I have earlier referred to three major expressions of the will aspect. There is
will, as the conditioner of the life aspect. This refers not to events,
happenings and occurrence, but to the nature of the life manifestations in
any cycle, through any nation or race, where humanity is concerned. This
refers also to the broad and general lines which at any time upon the planet
are setting the pace for the evolution of forms and which basically concerns
the force and endurance of the life as it manifests through and creates those
external conditions which are qualified and expressed in terms of life, of
quality and appearance. The word “life” in this triplicity of terms refers to
life as [592] humanity understands it. The word “life” to which I here refer
is the life to which H. Plutão .B. refers as that which synthesises spirit, soul and
body. (See The Secret Doctrine , I. 81). It is in reality that fourth something
which hovers behind all manifestation and behind all objects, all qualified
expressions of divinity and which is hinted at in the Bhagavad Gita in the
words: “Having pervaded this whole universe with a fragment of Myself, I
remain.”
There is next the will which brings fulfilment . This is the basis of all
relationships and all processes of inter-relation in our solar system and (as
far as humanity is concerned) in the planet. It is the prime factor in bringing
about the inevitability of the divine consummation; it is the cause of all
fruition of all forms on all planes and of divine intention; it is that which lies
back of consciousness itself. I know not how else to express this in words
and having done so they prove wholly inadequate. There is a faint, dim,
uncertain reflection of this will-fulfilment in the joy of achievement as
registered by a human being who finds his heart’s desire. Long processes of
evolution precede this fulfilment and long experience of the living activity
of the will of God as Life. This concentrated evolutionary effort, this
undeviating purpose has called forth more than desire and more than the will-to-be-active. There is a realised achievement from the very start for this
is the divine will-to-completion which precedes the creative effort. It is the
synthesis of creation, or persistent endeavour, adherence to vision and
complete sacrifice, and all of these in terms of divine experienced
experiment , if I might so formulate the idea. Remember, therefore, that all
through these experiences of the divine will runs the thread of a fulfilled
synthesis. This is more than cohesion in time and space; it is more [593]
than the principle of privation about which H. Plutão .B. speaks, and more than
self-imposed limitation. It is the end seen from the beginning; it is alpha and
omega producing the completed whole and the perfect fruition of the divine
will.
It is, finally, the will which conquers death . This again must not be
interpreted in terms of death as it affects the form nature of manifestation.
The note of synthesis and triumph—realised and complete—persists behind
all that we can recognise as death. This will is the principle of victory, of the
ultimate goal of life when fruition is achieved; it is the final united success
or unified conformity to a long foreseen purpose of spirit-matter, life-form,
plus that something which is the dream and goal of the highest initiates in
the Hierarchy to contact—the secret revelation of Shamballa itself. More it
is not possible to say. If Christ Himself is striving towards that knowledge, it
is not possible for us to do more than speculate.
In these few words, I have sought to convey an idea of a vast subjective
realisation. What I am hinting at in reality is the objective of that “endless
Way of which Nirvana itself is but the open door”—the Way to the higher
evolution for which our evolutionary process prepares mankind. I am
indicating what is the goal of all hierarchical endeavour. Mankind is so
preoccupied with the attitude and effort of the Hierarchy as regards human
welfare and guidance that the goal of the efforts of the Masters of the
Wisdom is naturally overlooked. It is in reality no concern of man.
Nevertheless, the picture of the divine Plan so oft emphasised in occult
books and by occult teachers is distorted unless it is realised that just as humanity strives towards the Hierarchy, so that Hierarchy itself strives
towards Shamballa. As the Old Commentary has it:
[594] “He who sees in the dark light of Shamballa penetrates to that which
lies beyond our little sphere to that which can be sensed behind the holy
triangle (Venus, Mercury, the Earth, A.A.B.). There is to be found the point
of radiant fire which shines within the eye (Taurus), which burns upon the
mountain-top (Capricorn) and which the water cannot quench (Aquarius).
These are the holiest three.”
As we consider the seven rays as outlined in Tabulation X, I would have you
bear in mind that we are viewing them as expressions of this threefold will.
We have studied them in some detail in my other books from the angle of
consciousness and from the point of view as producing changes and
expansions of consciousness in man, in nations and in races. Now, as far as
may be possible, we are going to consider these rays as they express the
pure, living activity of Deity as it fulfils Itself in manifestation as pure
incentive, directed impersonal energy, divine instinct which latter is a blend
of instinctual force and intuitive energy. It might be pointed out to those of
you who have some measure of occult perception that this synthetic Life,
being cosmic, emerges from cosmic planes and not systemic. Hence the
difficulty in comprehending it.
1. The conditioning will is the synthesis of the life of the cosmic physical
plane of which our seven planes are the seven subplanes. Until,
therefore, the human consciousness is far more expanded than it is, it
is not possible for man to understand this synthetic realisation.
2. The will which brings fulfilment is the divine incentive [595] (impulse
is not the correct term) coming from the cosmic astral plane.
3. The will which conquers death is an outpouring from the cosmic
mental plane.
From these three cosmic planes (embracing the sacred personality of the
Logoi, solar and planetary) come the united energies of the three
constellations which control and energise our solar system: The Great Bear, the Pleiades and Sirius; these work through the medium of the seven rays
and these in turn express themselves through the twelve constellations
which form the great zodiacal wheel. The Lords or ruling Powers of these
twelve sources of light and life “step down” the potency of these three major
energies so that our solar Logos can absorb them; they “tune out” those
aspects of these three Potencies which are not suited to our systemic life at
this point in the evolutionary process, just as the Hierarchy upon our little
planet tunes out or steps down the energies from Shamballa. These three
major energies in a mysterious manner express themselves through the
seven rays just as all triplicities subdivide into septenates, yet preserve their
identity. These seven energies, emanating from the major three and
transmitted via the twelve constellations, are embodied in the seven sacred
planets and are represented on our Earth by the seven Spirits before the
throne of God (the symbol of synthesis). This tremendous inter-relation is
embodied in one great process of: Transmission. Reception. Absorption.
Relation and Living Activity. The method is one of Invocation and Evocation
. In these two sentences, you have one of the most important clues to the
whole evolutionary process; the key to the mystery of time and space, and
the solution of [596] all problems. But the factor which is of major
importance is that the whole matter is an expression of focussed Will.
In considering this process, I would have you study Tabulation X, for it is a
symbolic form, embodying what I seek to convey. I would point out that the
will aspect—as it is embodied in the rays and transmitted by the
constellations—works out destructively when concentrated through an
orthodox planet and constructively when concentrated through an esoteric
planet. Here you have the secret guide to the significance of death and
immortality. This is something which the average astrologer will be unable
to prove because the cycles involved are too long; intuitively he can
however grasp the probability of my proposition. May I again remind you
that our theme is the divine plan, purpose and will; it is not the evolution of
consciousness, or of the second aspect of divinity. It concerns spirit and not
soul. We are attempting in some measure to formulate the life of the Father,
the will of the Monad and the purpose of Spirit. In all these (the three aspects of the will) lies germinating the seed of the next solar system, the
third, and the fruition of the Personality Manifestation of the Logos. We
need, therefore, to formulate the interpretation of the seven rays in terms of
will and not of love or consciousness. This we will now attempt to do.
RAY I.—The energy of Will or Power. This ray is outstandingly related to
that aspect of will which conquers death. It is nevertheless the Ray of the
Destroyer. In this connection, I would remind you that the human attitude
that death is the destroyer presents a limited and erroneous point of view.
The first ray destroys death because in reality there is no such thing; the
concept is all part of the Great Illusion, is a limitation of [597] the human
consciousness, and is basically connected with the brain and not with the
heart, strange as that may seem to you. It is in a very true sense “a figment
of the imagination.” Ponder on this. The abolition of death and of the
destruction of form is a manifestation of Ray I, for it brings about in reality
the death of negation and the inauguration of true activity. It is the energy
which can be called “divine incentive”; it is the life in the seed which
destroys successively all forms in order that realised fruition may eventuate.
That is the clue to Ray I. It is the Will which initiates .
Today, as regards humanity, its highest realisation is initiation.
RAY Gêmeos .—The energy of Love-Wisdom. This basic energy is the will to
unify, to synthesise, to produce coherence and mutual attraction and to
establish relationships, but—remember this—relationships which are
entirely apart from the consciousness of relation or the realisation of unity. It
is the fact of unification as seen from the beginning and as existing ever and
forever in the Mind of God Whose will embraces past, present and future
and Whose mind does not think in terms of evolution or of process. The
process is inherent in the seed; the evolutionary urge is the inevitable
accompaniment of life in manifestation. It is the Will to unification.
Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is the mystical vision.
RAY III.—The energy of Active Intelligence. This is the will of conditioned
purpose. The factors which are working out through its medium are the forceful carrying forward of the recognised plan with a goal intelligently
[598] conceived and an active incentive which carries the process
intelligently forward on the strength of its own momentum. Again I would
remind you that I am dealing not with human consciousness but with the
sum total of that undertaking which makes matter subservient to and
adaptable to the basic idea in the mind of God. And no human being is as
yet able to conceive of that idea. No one knows what is the will of God or
what is the nature of His intelligent purpose. It is the Will to evolution.
Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is education, or
progressive development through experience.
RAY IV.—The energy of Harmony through Conflict. This is fundamentally
the will to destroy limitation. This is not the same thing as the will to
destroy negation as in the case of Ray I, but is an allied aspect of that. I am
not referring to the consciousness aspect which recognises and profits by
such struggle. I am referring to the energy, inherent in all forms and
peculiarly strong in humanity (because man is self-conscious), which
produces inevitably and unavoidably the struggle between life and that
which it has chosen as a limitation; this eventually shatters or breaks up that
limitation the moment that a point of real harmony or at-one-ment has been
reached. Esoterically it might be said that the moment that form (limitation)
and life balance each other a rift immediately appears and through it flows a
fresh outpouring of the will. Christ had to die because He had achieved
harmony with the will of God and then “the veil of the Temple was rent in
twain from the top to the bottom.” The significance of this fresh [599]
inflow of the Will will now appear; the stage is set anew for a fresh and
renewed activity of the living principle. As far as humanity is concerned the
“seeds of death” emerge through the medium of this Ray and the Grim
Reaper, Death, is but an aspect of this will, conditioned by the fourth ray
and emerging from the fourth plane. Death is an act of the intuition,
transmitted by the soul to the personality and then acted upon in conformity
to the divine will by the individual will. This is the Will to harmonisation . Today, its highest expression as regards humanity is the intuition, as it
works out through group activity. Death always releases the individual into
the group.
RAY V.—The energy of Concrete Science or Knowledge. To understand
this expression of the divine will, the student should bear in mind the occult
aphorism that “matter is spirit at its lowest point of manifestation and spirit
is matter at its highest.” Basically this is the will which produces concretion
and yet at the same time constitutes the point at which spirit and matter are
balanced and co-equal. That is the reason why human perfection is carried
forward consciously upon the mental plane, the fifth plane; this is brought
about by the fifth ray and upon this plane liberation takes place at the time
of the fifth initiation. This is the will which is inherent in substance and
which actuates all atoms of which all forms are made. It is closely related to
the first solar system even whilst liberating members of the human family
who will constitute the nucleus around which the third solar system is
constructed. The energy of this ray is intelligence; it is the seed of
consciousness but not of consciousness as we understand it; it is the inherent
[600] life of matter and the will to work intelligently; it is that living
something for which we have no name which was the product of the first
solar system. It is one of the major assets of God, the Father and also of the
human Monad. This is the Will to Action.
Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is liberation—through
death or initiation.
RAY VI.—The energy of Devotion or of Idealism. This is the will which
embodies God’s idea. It provides the motive power behind the working out
of whatever may be the purpose of creation. What that purpose is we have
not as yet the faintest idea. An ideal is related to the consciousness aspect as
far as human beings are concerned. An idea is related to the will aspect.
This ray embodies a dominant potency. It expresses God’s desire and is the
basic energy emanating from the cosmic astral plane. It conceals the
mystery which is to be found in the relationship of the will and desire.
Desire is related to consciousness. Will is not . We are not, however, dealing with consciousness but with that impersonal force which drives forward
through all the seven planes of our solar system and which makes the idea
of God a consummated fact in the Eternal Now. Does that statement mean
much to you? I would surmise that it means but little; it is a basic statement
of occult fact anent energy as it expresses itself through humanity in a
manner which is unique and peculiar. I would here remind you of a
statement in The Secret Doctrine that “an Idea is a Being incorporeal which
has no subsistence by itself but gives figure and form unto shapeless matter
and becomes the cause of the manifestation.” This statement takes you
straight back to God [601] the Father, to the Monad, to the One. It is related,
consequently, to the Will and not to consciousness. Consciousness is per se
the recognition of a progressive plan. The Will is the cause, the energising
Principle, Life, Being. This is the Will to Causation .
Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is idealism, the incentive
and cause of human activity.
RAY VII.—This is the energy of Ceremonial Order. It is an expression of
the will which drives through into outer manifestation; it is that which
embodies both the periphery and the point at the centre. It is the will to
“ritualistic synthesis,” if I might so word it. It is Necessity which is the
prime conditioning factor of the divine nature—the necessity to express
itself; the necessity to manifest in an orderly rhythmic manner; the necessity
to embrace “that which is above and that which is below” and, through the
medium of this activity, to produce beauty, order, perfect wholes and right
relationships. It is the driving energy which Being emanates as It appears
and takes form and lives. It is the Will towards Expression.
Today, as regards humanity, its highest expression is organisation.
In the above statements anent the rays, you can see that the full circle of
their activity is complete from the angle of God the Father; the will to
initiate manifestation and its attendant progressive expression meets the will
towards full achievement and the energy of Being itself arrives—in time and
space today (in the mind of God) at full consummation. 3. The Keynotes of the Seven Rays and the Will
Aspect.
[602] The keynotes of these seven Rays are, therefore, as they constitute the
revelation of seven Great Beings:
Initiation. Unification. Evolution. Harmonisation. Action. Causation.
Expression.
These are the keynotes for humanity at its present point of evolutionary
development; as these seven energies play upon the human consciousness in
an effort to produce and evoke the Will aspect in advanced man they
produce:
Initiation. Vision. Education. Intuition. Liberation. Idealism. Organisation.
A close study of these seven major rays and seven minor keynotes will
reveal these truths and their promise. At the close of the Aquarian Age,
these keynotes will vary somewhat because the recognition of the Will
(leading to understanding cooperation) will produce major changes in
human polarisation and human objectives—realised objectives.
Let us now see how these basic ray energies will work out in man’s
planetary and zodiacal relationships and why certain constellations and
planets are related to certain rays and transmit into the centre which we call
humanity definite and specific influences. These produce certain tendencies
in humanity, evoke certain attitudes of the will, and lead consequently to
certain unavoidable events as well as to definite and determined forms of
Being.
As we proceed with our consideration of Tabulation X, there are certain
fundamental ideas which must be carefully borne in mind. Let me list them
for your helping:
1. We are dealing with the effect of the seven ray energies, as they pour forth
from one or other of the seven stars of the Great Bear into our solar system.
These energies [603] are the life-quality of the seven great Beings Who are the Prototypes of the planetary Logoi of the sacred planets, seven in number.
These latter are Their reflections in time and space, as the soul is the
reflector of the Monad where human beings are concerned.
2. The seven rays express themselves, each through three of the zodiacal
constellations. The analogy (but not the correspondence) is that these three
constellations are to the life of one of these ray Beings what the three
aspects of monad-soul-body are to a man. Again, it is only analogy. Forget
not that analogy and correspondence are not the same. In the first case there
is resemblance but not in detail. In the second, there is practically identical
expression, usually on a lower level.
3. These seven great Beings express Themselves in our solar system as the
custodians or the exponents of the Will aspect of Deity. Their effect,
therefore, is ever to convey into our solar system and eventually into our
planetary life, the energy of the Will, in its planmaking, form-building
nature. Esoteric books and esoteric teaching have necessarily laid the
emphasis upon consciousness as it expresses quality. That is as it should be.
But behind all quality lies That of which the quality is the expression and
behind that is to be found the dynamic “out-going” (if I might so express it)
which is the motivation of both the quality or consciousness and the life or
appearance, the precipitation of will and quality. Júpiter . The nature of the will is as yet undefinable for only the Monad responds
to its impact, and only after the third initiation does man somewhat grasp
the nature of the will. All that is possible to understand in this brief
summation is the effect of the will as it makes its presence [604] felt and the
result of its expression, emphasised through the three constellations.
5. The constellations in groups of three transmit the seven influences of the
seven rays to our planet, via the Sun, and the relationships which I am here
indicating are only those in connection with our Earth. They do not apply in
relation to others of the planets in our solar system, where the configuration
of the relationship is different. This is dependent upon the nature of the etheric web through which all transmission of energies takes place. The
lines of approach might be indicated as follows:
DIAGRAM ONE An illustration of this in line with our tabulation would be:
DIAGRAM TWO [605] 6. This diamond shaped formation of the inter-related energies is the
prototypal pattern which lies behind the etheric network and is its final,
conditioning influence as far as our Earth is concerned. It is hinted at in the
reference to the “diamond soul” of which the Buddha is an exponent. This is
necessarily a deep mystery but the correlation is interesting and
guaranteeing.
7. These seven ray energies, expressing the divine prototypal will in seven
forms, are as follows: Ray I.—The will to initiate.
Ray Gêmeos .—The will to unify.
Ray III.—The will to evolve.
Ray IV.—The will to harmonise or relate.
Ray V.—The will to act.
Ray VI.—The will to cause.
Ray VII.—The will to express.
When their full creative work is completed, there will emerge a “something
else or other” for which we have no name but which will be the seed of the
next solar system. This third solar system will express the divine will, as
this is slowly developed through the experiment and experience of the
divine love.
8. These seven ray aspects of the will, which are the goal of the higher
initiations and which embody that which the Masters Themselves are
struggling to understand, is that which flowers in the Monad when souls
have reached perfected expression through humanity. They express
themselves where humanity is concerned as:
Ray I.—That which incites to and produces initiation.
Ray Gêmeos .—That which is the cause of vision or the power to see. [606]
Ray III.—That which develops sensory perception into knowledge,
knowledge into wisdom and wisdom into omniscience.
Ray IV.—That which is the illumined will, the basis of buddhi or the
intuition.
Ray V.—That which is the cosmic seed of liberation. This is an aspect of
destruction.
Ray VI.—That which is the cause of the thoughtform building faculty,
related to the creative urge.
Ray VII.—That which can be called the principle of order. Mercúrio . Just as desire has produced this “son of necessity,” our solar system, there
lies behind all the energies of the Heart of God and all the forces which have
produced the manifested universe that which is the result of divine need. It
is neither the cosmic correspondence of brain or mind or focussed intention,
as you might surmise. It is that synthetic something which produces
cohesion and results in fruition or synthesis as the effect or final result of
manifestation.
It is well-nigh impossible for me to make this any clearer because I am
speaking of some of the final aspects and effects of the highest initiations. I
only touch upon them because they consummate and climax this study of
divine psychology as it manifests through God and through man. I am
simply giving faint and inadequate indications of that which emerges in the
human consciousness after the third initiation—the point at which
personality or form life is transcended and the Monad becomes the object of
the desired attainment; its spiritual pressure is then increasingly felt. It is,
therefore, only possible to point to distant goals. [607] We can, however,
gain some dim, human interpretations of divine goals by relating these rays
and their transmitting constellations to our Earth and by noting how this
triangular relationship can work out on our planet. Individual apprehension
will be dependent upon the point of development and only the higher
initiates will understand the real implications of my remarks.
You have to remember, therefore, as you study these most deeply esoteric
relations that we approach them from two angles—the only angles which
are as yet possible to the finite mind of man:
1. The relation of the three constellations to the rays which are each
expressing the quality of the Life of an Informing Entity—the Being Who is
expressing Identity through one or other of the seven stars of the Great Bear,
Ursa Major, as we probably ought to call this constellation.
2. The three aspects of the will which the three constellations are expressing
and to which human beings will consciously respond after the third
initiation. These three aspects are: a. The will which conditions and initiates.
b. The will which brings fulfilment.
c. The will which conquers death.
Before entering into a closer analysis of our subject, I would remind you
that we are in reality dealing with universals, symbolised for us in the huge
aggregate of constellations with which our theme is concerned:
1. The seven stars of the Great Bear or Ursa Major are involved in an
intricate relation with Ursa Minor and the Pleiades. With this we shall not
deal. This major [608] triplicity of constellations has a peculiar relation to
that Great Being to Whom I have at times referred as the One About Whom
Naught Can Be Said. All that can be hinted at is that these three galaxies of
stars are the three aspects of that Indescribable, Absolute Monad, the
Ineffable Cause of the seven solar systems—of which ours is one.
2. The twelve constellations of the zodiac, each with its own inter-relations,
peculiar to its own integral Life, form—each of them—part of a triangle of
energies. Each of these triangles is a unit in itself but in conjunction with the
other triangles forms part of that major quaternary which is the cosmic
analogy of the quaternary of the One Life—soul and the dual psychic
nature, called in some of the esoteric books kama-manas , plus the vital
nature. These four are the expression of the One Ineffable Cause.
3. Our solar system (of supreme unimportance) is yet a part of the sevenfold
appearance of that same Essential Cause. As you know, from a study of The
Secret Doctrine , our solar system is a tiny reflection or replica of the 1, the
3, the 7, the 12. Because of that innate, inherent correspondence, it has
within itself the capacity to respond to the energies emanating from this
fountainhead of light and will. More than this I may not say, because the
entire theme is too vast for human thinking, with its limitations of
consciousness and its inadequacy of language. But even a dim perception of
that vast aggregation of intelligent Forces and this immense concatenation
of stupendous, divine “Intentions” will serve to bring into clearer light, the
realisation that our solar system (and consequently our planet) is a part of this vast whole, kept alive by its “grace,” [609] fused by its will, and
preserved by its “Intention.” Because these Forces are , we are; because
They persist, we persist; because They move in form, in space, in time, we
do the same. Júpiter . Cosmic Energies and Transformation.
Let us now briefly get an idea of this stream of energies as they move
outward into space from Ursa Major, as they are transmitted, through certain
zodiacal constellations to our solar system and thence, via the Sun to the
seven sacred planets. These produce what are called “transformations” on
our non-sacred planet, the Earth, bringing it increasingly into line with the
will aspect of divinity. You have in reality the following explanatory
diagram, which may make the whole process somewhat clearer to you:
DIAGRAM THREE This is the only way that I can give you an idea of the distribution of
energies, their limitation within the bounds of the zodiac, and their
focussing within the periphery of [610] our solar system. Let me make it
more specific as regards one of the rays and its triangular relationships as
given in Tabulation X: DIAGRAM FOUR a. The Earth being itself one of the five non-sacred planets, only four are
listed as among the transfiguring agents.
b. The darkened planets indicate the transmitting agents of the Forces,
passed through the transformation process by the Sun.
c. The Sun and Moon are listed among the non-sacred planets as they
are, in this instance, blinds or veils.
d. The origin of the hour glass is to be found in this diagram of the
inflowing energies.
e. The above diagram can be used in connection with any of the seven
rays, but will involve:
1. The use of other transmitting agents in the form of the
appropriate three zodiacal constellations and their rulers. [611]
2. The indicating of planets, different to those involved in the
inflow of first ray energy.
f. The key to the whole process as far as the Earth is concerned—and the
individual on the Earth—is to be found in the words:
Transcending.—The transcending cause. Transmitting.—The zodiacal constellations.
Transforming.—The Sun. The Soul.
Transfiguring.—The planets.
To these I might add one word in connection with the Earth and its
humanity which is allied to all the above.
DIAGRAM FIVE This word is Translated , for when the “souls of just men are made perfect,”
a process of translation takes place which [612] lifts humanity off and away
from the planet on to one or other of the seven cosmic Paths to which our
seven initiations form the entering doors.
In connection with the human individual and his progress and initiation or
translation from one state of consciousness to another, there is to be found a
small replica of the above: a. The soul of man receives from all three major planetary centres or
groups.
b. The darkened spots indicate awakened, alert centres.
c. The diagram indicates the “interior light chart” of an advanced
aspirant on the verge of discipleship.
The whole story of extension from the One into the Many and of the Many
into the One is contained in these macrocosmic and microcosmic diagrams.
Let us now take each of the seven Rays and see how they embody and
transmit the three aspects of the will, via three constellations and their
rulers, to our Earth. We enter here into the realm of causes and are dealing
with those transcendent purposes, incentives, urges and objectives of the
One in Whom we live and move and have our being. This great Life, the
Ancient of Days, the Lord of the world, Sanat Kumara, the Eternal Youth,
the planetary Logos—His many names are of relative unimportance—is the
only Existence upon our planet Who is capable of responding to and
carrying out the objectives of the solar Logos. He, in His turn, is the only
one in our solar system capable of responding to the sevenfold Emanating
Cause, expressing Itself through the Great Bear or Ursa Major. We will,
however, deal with the psychological aspects of the emanations of the seven
Rays which embody the will-to-good . [613]
RAY I. Will or
Power: Aries,
Leo . . . . . working through the medium of the four planets: Mars, Mercury, the
Sun, Saturn.
Capricorn. This is the will which lies behind all initiatory activity , that is,
a. The initiation of the previous stages of creation.
b. The initiation of the urge to evolve, proceed, progress.
c. The initiation of the differentiating process in order to produce.
These are all expressions or effects of the activity of the ray energy and all
can be best summed up in the thought of a dynamic “entering into”—by an act of the focussed will—a new state of consciousness. This leads inevitably
to a new realisation of being. In this statement, you have one of the basic
definitions of initiation as far as the initiation of a human being is
concerned. These are dim reflections of the dynamic processes to which the
One Life subjects Itself as it enters into the dualistic condition of spiritmatter. The will here referred to lies behind the dualism and is analogous to
the reception and focussing of an initial idea as it enters into the mind of a
creative, advanced human being, his thought processes and his
achievements. Some understanding of this will come if the disciple will
consider what fixed aspiration, a vision of the goal and a determination to
follow the will-to-good has effected in his life. Beyond this realisation, he
cannot go, but it holds for him the cosmic seed of understanding.
It is necessary to remember that on the Path of Initiation, the whole training
process is turned towards the evolution of the will and this is possible
because behind the development of love lies the revelation of the will. It is
rightly [614] taught that man’s immediate goal is the unfoldment (into full
expression) of the love nature. This begins to take place and reaches a
relatively high stage of unfoldment upon the Path of Discipleship. The detail
of the process in a broad and general sense might be stated as follows:
1. Path of Evolution and Probation.
a. Unfoldment of intellect and of sensory perception.
b. Response to the centre called Humanity .
c. The mind takes control. Personality functions.
2. Path of Discipleship.
a. Unfoldment of the love nature.
b. Achievement of illumination.
c. Response to the centre called the Hierarchy .
d. Buddhi or the intuition is in control. The soul functions.
3. Path of Initiation .
a. Unfoldment of the will.
b. Achievement of synthesis. c. Response to the centre called Shamballa .
d. Dynamic Purpose in control. The will-to-good. The Monad
functions.
This covers familiar ground for all of you but in the effort to achieve a
vision of the whole, constant repetition has its place. We are now concerned
with the third stage of the evolutionary process, carried forward upon the
Path of Initiation and entered into (as far as humanity is concerned) at the
third initiation, and consummated at the seventh initiation—an initiation far
more easily reached by people upon the first Ray than on any of the others.
This—as far as you can at this time grasp—concerns primarily the creative
will as it: [615]
1. Initiates manifestation, and conditions that which is created.
2. Brings about eventual fulfilment.
3. Overcomes death or differentiation.
All initiates must and eventually do express dynamic, creative will, a
focussed purpose which expresses only the will-to-good and also that
sustained effort which brings fulfilment. I would remind you here that
sustained effort is the seed of synthesis, the cause of achievement and that
which finally overcomes death . Death is really deterioration in time and
space and is due to the tendency of matter-spirit to isolate itself, whilst in
manifestation (from the standpoint of consciousness). This sustained effort
of the Logos is what keeps all forms in manifestation and preserves even the
life aspect as the integrating factor in form building and—which is equally
an act of the sustaining will—can abstract or withdraw the life
consciousness intact at the close of a cycle of manifestation. Death and
limitation are synonymous terms. When the consciousness is focussed in
form and identified entirely with the principle of limitation, it regards
freedom from form life as death; but, as evolution proceeds, the
consciousness shifts increasingly into awareness of that which is not form
and into the realm of that which is transcendent or into the world of the
abstract, i.e., into that which is abstracted from form and focussed in itself. This, by the way is a definition of meditation from the angle of goal and
achievement. A man can truly meditate when he begins to use the mind, the
reflection of the will aspect, and employs it in its three aspects: as initiating
his entrance into the world of souls, as conditioning his personality life and
as enforcing and eventually bringing about a full expression of soul purpose.
This results [616] in the complete overcoming of death. I am bringing this
whole concept down into terms of the microcosm even though it will be
obvious that only the pledged disciple in preparation for initiation can begin
to grasp some of the significant implications.
Perhaps I can best sum up the keynote of the first Ray of Will or Power, as it
seeks expression as dynamic purpose on Earth and in relation to the human
being, by quoting or paraphrasing the Old Commentary .
“The Transcendent One, the Life, the Whole, the All entered into
communion with Itself and by this act became a vital point of life and
focussed power.
I am and I am not. Greater than This is That; smaller than That is This.
But That must show to This the nature of the whole, and showing prove
itself unto Itself.
I, the beginning am. I am the outward and the inward Way and back
into the point of concentration and from the point I turn again unto
Myself, carrying within my heart of love that which I, the One, have
served and that for which I sacrifice Myself.”
In the process of sacrifice, that which is the sustaining Whole, the inner core
of all life and the principle of integration, realises within Itself the following
stages in consciousness:
1. It knows Itself as the transcending will , the will which sees the entire
process from the point of initiation, but which limits itself to the gradual
expression of that will on account of the limitations of those aspects of Itself
[617] whose consciousness is not that of the Whole. That which initiates,
sees the end from the beginning and works towards the goal in progressive stages, not for Itself but for those aspects which are still limited, unaware,
blind and unseeing and unreasoning.
2. It knows Itself as the transmitting will , working from the point of
synthesis, stepping down the energies distributed, in line with the creative,
evolutionary plan. This, the Life of our planet, carried forward in three
major stages, particularly from the consciousness angle; that is via
Shamballa, the Hierarchy and Humanity. From thence the transmitting Life
moves outward into all the other kingdoms of nature. Each great centre is,
therefore, a transmitting agency. The fourth Creative Hierarchy, the human
Kingdom, is the agent through which eventually the energies of Shamballa
and of the Hierarchy will be focussed for the redeeming of the life of all the
sub-human kingdoms. This can only take place when humanity can work
with the focussed will, engendered by the life of Shamballa, inspired by
love, fostered by the Hierarchy and expressed through the intellect which
humanity itself has developed—all of these used dynamically and
consciously under the pressure of that which is higher and greater than
Shamballa itself.
3. It knows Itself as the transforming will or that sustained, applied process
which brings about the needed mutations and changes through the action of
the constant incentive of the will-to-good. Yet at the same time it is not
identified in any way with the process. These mutations, producing
transformation of the One into the Many and later in time and space of the
Many into the One are carried forward from a point of [618] focussed,
dynamic will, the “Point in the Centre” which changes not but remains ever
immovably subject to its own inherent purpose.
When the disciple or the initiate can stand also at the centre as the
transforming will, he can then bring about the needed changes in the form
nature without identifying himself with it or being himself affected by the
changes. This may serve to make my meaning clear. Júpiter . It knows Itself as the transfiguring will . This transfiguration is the
fulfilment of purpose and the final expression of synthesis brought about by the sustaining will-to-good of the transcending, transmitting, transforming
will.
Students would do well to shift their eyes off the goal of transfiguration
(achieved at the third initiation and increasingly present at each previous
initiation) and pay more attention to the recognition of that in them which
“having pervaded their little universe with a fragment of itself remains .”
They will then have anchored their consciousness in the centre of
transcending power and guaranteed the flow of the will-to-achieve. From
that high point in consciousness (imaginatively reached at first and
practically achieved later) they would find it useful to work at the process of
transmission, knowing themselves to be agents for the transmission of the
will-to-good of the Transcendent One. They should next pass on to the stage
of transformation wherein they would visualise and expect to see developed
the needed transformation carried forward in their lives; then—equally
expectant—they should believe in the transfiguration of those lives in line
with the will of the [619] Transcendent One, the success of the Transmitting
One, and the activity of the Transforming One—all of Whom are but the
One, the Monad, the Self. All this is done by the use of the will,
conditioning, fulfilling and overcoming.
To return to our theme of the greater Whole, leaving behind us for a minute
the efforts of the microcosm to comprehend the Macrocosm, let us consider
the relation of the three constellations in the task of expressing Ray One:
1. ARIES is the constellation through which initiating conditions will stream
into our solar system. It embodies the will-to-create that which will express
the will-to-good. It is the monadic ray of our planetary Logos, Whose Soul
ray is the second and the personality ray the third. You can note here,
therefore, how the transmitting ray of our planetary Logos is the first; and
hence the place which the will plays in our human evolutionary process; His
transforming ray is the second and that eventually brings transfiguration
through the medium of the third and in this combination you have the
reason why, in the evolution of the will aspect, you have the influence of
Mars and Mercury—the one bringing conflict and the death of the form and the other bringing illumination and the development of the intuition as a
result of that conflict and death. New cycles of Being and of consciousness
are initiated by conflict. Such seems as yet to be the law of life and the
governing factor in evolution. If, however, the result of this initiating,
energising will is to produce such beneficent effects of intuitive
understanding and the activity of Mercury as the messenger of the Gods, it
can be seen how truly through conflict the will-to-good can be wrought out.
2. LEO . This is the constellation through which the will-to-fulfilment or to
achievement pours into humanity and on to the planet. It is essentially the
spirit of self-determination. [620] It is at first the determination of the little
self, the personality, the self-conscious individual. It is next the
determination of the Self, the soul, the group conscious individual, aware of
the greater Whole and of itself as the part, integrated and basically at-one.
This will-to-good (achieved through fulfilment) works out in relation to the
human being through the medium of three climaxes:
1. The will-to-good, demonstrated by the achieving of selfconsciousness. This is the first stage of completed, divine fulfilment.
It connotes body, appearance. It is the expression of the third aspect.
2. The will-to-good, demonstrated at the third initiation when selfconsciousness gives place to group consciousness. This is the second
stage of divine fulfilment. It connotes soul, quality. It is the
expression of the second aspect.
3. The will-to-good, demonstrated in the higher initiations when Godconsciousness is achieved. This is the third stage of divine fulfilment.
It connotes Monad, Life. It is the expression of the first aspect.
It is useful to see these relationships. It will also be obvious why the Sun
rules Leo, both exoterically and esoterically. The Sun reveals or “lights up”
the two stages of the hidden will: the physical sun, lighting up the
personality upon the physical plane and the Heart of the Sun revealing the
nature of the soul. 3. CAPRICORN . This is the constellation by means of which comes the
conquering will which releases from form life and initiates the man into the
kingdom wherein the will aspect (not the soul aspect) of divinity expresses
itself. You will remember that there is a close connection between [621] the
Earth and Capricorn. The reason for this is that the Earth provides ideal
conditions for this particular type of achievement because it is in process of
transforming from the stage of a “non-sacred planet” into that of a “sacred
planet.” This is why Saturn is so powerful a ruler and transmitter to the
Earth of the dynamic quality of the first ray of power. This inpouring of first
ray energy will be greatly accelerated from now on. These energies and their
inflow must be carefully studied in connection with the diagrams given
earlier in this treatise, remembering that visualisation is always a directing
energy , employed to bring about a specific desired effect.
Aries, the Initiator, Leo, the Self, and Capricorn, the transfiguring Agent—
such are some of the implications in relation to the first ray and humanity.
I would point out here that I have given this triangle of constellations in the
order of their relationship to the Great Life Who employs them as
transmitting agencies for first ray activities. It should also be noted that the
reason for this relation is inherent in the nature of the informing Lives of the
particular constellations. They are Themselves expressions of the will-togood and, therefore, constitute the line of least resistance for the
dissemination of first ray energy throughout our solar system. From the
angle of human relations, this triangle rearranges itself. It becomes Leo, the
giver of self-consciousness; Capricorn, the sign wherein initiation can be
taken; and Aries, the incentive towards a new beginning. In the
understanding of the significance of the distinction between constellations
as galaxies of stars, and signs as concentrated influences will come fresh
light upon the science of astrology. This is fundamentally connected with
the difference between the relation of a ray energy to the triangle of
constellations and the human [622] relation. More I may not say but this
will give a hint to the intuitive astrologer.
RAY Gêmeos . Love- Gemini, Wisdom.
Virgo . . working through the medium of the five planets: Mercury, Jupiter,
...
Venus, the Moon, Pluto.
Pisces. This “line of distribution” (if I may so express it) is related to the will which
produces inevitable union, at-one-ment and synthesis, through the power of
attraction, based upon power to see the vision. In this solar system and
during this world cycle and, therefore, upon our planet and throughout the
period wherein our planet moves from the position of a non-sacred to a
sacred planet, this is the dominating will aspect of Deity; it is the energy
with which our planetary Logos is preoccupied. It is that which has brought
the Hierarchy into being, under the impact of the Shamballa or first ray
force. It is, however, with hierarchical energy that humanity is, at this time,
preoccupied. In my use of the word “preoccupied” in connection both with
the planetary Logos and humanity, you will find indication of a growing
response between the two centres, Shamballa and Humanity.
Anent this ray energy, the esotericists of the world know much and this for
three reasons:
1. The emphasis of all the teaching given out during the past three
hundred and fifty years has been upon it.
2. The two great exponents of this ray energy are the two best known
world Teachers and Saviours from the human point of view in both
the East and the West: the Buddha and the Christ.
3. The two Masters Who have attempted to awaken humanity in the West
to a realisation of the Hierarchy [623] are the Masters Morya and
K.H., the two working in the closest relation and expressing first and
second ray energy.
The keynotes of illumination, of vision, of sight or of spiritual perception
and of the fusion of the occidental or the mystic way are dominant in this
cycle. The Buddha summed up in Himself all the light of the past as far as
humanity was concerned. He was the culminating Messenger, and
demonstrated the innate possibilities of mankind, radiating the light of wisdom in relation to the light of substance and producing that dual blaze or
flaming light which had been fanned and fostered (though not fully
expressed) by humanity up to that time. He came forth as the flower or
fruition of the past and as the guarantee of man’s innate capacity. Christ,
whilst able also to say “I am the light of the world,” went further in His
manifestation and gave a vision of the next step, demonstrating the light of
the soul and pointing to the future, thus presenting that which could be
because He had released on Earth the cosmic principle of love. Love is an
aspect of the will, which is a point very little realised by the mass of men. It
is the will to draw into itself or the will to attract into itself, and this will,
when exerted toward that which is not material, we, in reaction to the
differentiating mind, call Love. But humanity has to see that which must be
loved before that power of the will is sufficiently evoked. Then the vision
can become a manifestation and a fact in expression.
It is here that the wonder of the work of Christ, the Lord of Love emerges
into our consciousness. He makes it very clear that this love which He
demonstrated was an aspect of the will, functioning through the medium of
the second ray; this powerful love released into the world the [624] cosmic
principle of love. Again the three aspects of the divine will can be seen
functioning through the second ray:
1. The will-to-initiate or to condition demonstrates in Christ’s work as He
inaugurates the era wherein it became possible for the kingdom of God to
appear on Earth. In reality, this will be a demonstration of the fusion of the
two centres, Humanity and the Hierarchy. By fusion, I mean their complete
reciprocal at-one-ment. It will inaugurate an era wherein—through
increased capacity to see the vision and increased power to identify oneself
with the vision—a race of men will be produced whose life expression will
be that of love-wisdom.
2. The will which brings fulfilment demonstrates through the second ray by
the means of that driving force which enables the second ray soul steadily to
achieve its goal, relentlessly pushing forward, permitting itself no let-up or
leeway until the desired goal is reached. This is a different expression to the will of the first ray which is dynamic and which crashes forward in spite of
all obstacles; the latter does not require the slower methods of the steady
drive.
3. It is also the will which conquers death because of its intense love of
reality and of that “persistent One” who exists behind all phenomena.
In the Old Commentary this type of will—the will-to-love—is spoken of in
the following terms:
“The Transcendent One said: I am alone. I must arise and seek with
ceaseless urge, that which produces completion, round out my circle
whole, intensity My life and make Me truly One, and this because I
recognise the Two. I must have union with my other self, the self I
dimly sense. [625]
Unto My heart I drew that other One and drawing thus I gave
enlightenment; I dowered with enrichments; I freely gave.”
This embodies not the mystical vision of the other one but the will aspect of
the planetary Logos, the incentive behind the life of Shamballa. It is the
Lord of Sacrifice Who speaks. The keynote of sacrifice or the “process of
making whole” runs through all that concerns the will aspect as it functions
through the medium of the seven rays; this becomes beautifully apparent in
the activity of the second ray as it is the channel for the will of God.
It knows itself as the transcending will because behind its expression of
cosmic love (attracting, fusing and producing cohesion) lies a synthetic
vision of divine Intention. It differentiates between process and goal,
between initiation and that which is revealed by the initiatory process and
that is something which as yet is unknown to initiates below the third
degree. Herein lies the distinction between the Christ and the Buddha. The
latter revealed the process, but the Christ embodied in Himself both goal
and process. He revealed the cosmic principle of love and by its means—
embodied in Himself—He produced effects also and momentous changes in
the world through those presented to Him for initiation. The second ray knows itself as the transmitting will because through its
means something passes between the pair of opposites (spirit-matter) which
draws them together until eventually they form one blended whole. This is a
basic mystery—the basic mystery of initiation and concerns the at-oning
will which functions through love. Its lowest expression and its most
material symbol is the love between the sexes.
[626] It knows itself likewise as the transforming will because the entire
evolutionary process (which is, in the last analysis, the working out of the
inter-relation between God and His world, between cause and effect and
between Life and form) is based upon the transformation brought about by
divine attraction. This enables “spirit to mount upon the shoulders of
matter,” as H. Plutão .B. expresses it, and forces matter to achieve the purification
which will lead it eventually to act as a transparent medium for the
revelation of divinity.
It knows itself finally as the will which transfigures . It was this
transfiguration which Christ manifested when He emerged before the
startled eyes of His disciples as Light Incarnate and “was transfigured
before them.”
The entire process of transcendence, resulting in transfiguration, is worked
out in relation to the second ray by the combined influences of the three
constellations through which this ray chooses by an “act of its sufficient will
to act in time and space.” Let us look at them for a moment:
1. GEMINI . This is the great symbolic constellation of the Two Brothers,
expressing the interplay between the dualities. Because it is governed by
Mercury and Venus, you have the light of the intuition and of the mind
blended together into one illuminated whole, typical of the fusion of spiritmatter and the demonstration of their essential oneness. Gemini, as you
know, is the sign of divine interplay and it is the life of the Father (of spirit
and of will) which flows through the Two Brothers, through the polar
opposites, making them one in reality though two in manifestation. Their
real nature as the “elder brother and the prodigal son” is revealed by the intuition when it takes hold of the mind. But it is the will to love which
governs the relationship and which finally brings about divine synthesis.
[627]
2. VIRGO is the constellation which is symbolic of the second stage of the
relation between the pair of opposites. Here we have, as you know, the
Mother of the Christ Child and the fostering process of interchange which
brings about life, love and their united manifestation in one form. This
second ray is, therefore, closely related to Virgo and its lowest aspect is
mother love with its instinctual care of that which must be nourished and
guarded. Its highest aspect is the incarnated, manifested Christ. Then
instinct is transmuted into wisdom and with that the will-to-manifest and
bring into the light of day the hitherto Hidden Christ. This sign and this
second ray Will have a mysterious relation to Time, to process and to the
sustaining life of the Mother (matter) which, throughout the gestation
period, nourishes and cares for the rapidly developing Christ Child. The
Moon has also a peculiar function which can only be expressed in the idea
of death—the death of the relationships between the Mother and the Child
because the moment comes when the Christ Child will emerge from the
womb of time and of matter and stand free in the light. This will have been
due, necessarily, to many inherent factors but primarily to the sustaining will
of the Mother, plus the dynamic will of the Christ Child. Here again is an
aspect of the curious and mysterious relation between the first and the
second rays.
3. PISCES . In this sign the work is consummated and the will of the Father
works out through the second ray will as the will-to-save. In Gemini,
therefore, you have the two, the pair of opposites and the will-to-relate; in
Virgo, you have their work in cooperation, the nurturing of the life of that
second ray phenomenon, a Christ, the consummation of the task of matter
and its elevation into heaven. In Pisces, you have the consummation of the
work of that [628] which the matter aspect has made possible, and the
Christ emerges as the world saviour. All this has taken place through the
will aspect of the second ray, focussed in Shamballa, expressing itself through humanity and consummated in the Hierarchy. Here you have the
whole story of unity, brought about by the life and the will of the second ray,
producing the emergence of the Christ consciousness and the appearing in
objectivity of the Christ principle.
In time and space and from the angle of humanity, the triangle of
constellations is Virgo, Gemini and Pisces and not the order as here given,
which is Gemini, Virgo, Pisces; the latter is the angle from the standpoint of
Shamballa.
RAY III. Active
Intelligence. Cancer,
Libra . . . . . . . . . . . . working through five planets:
The Moon, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus. Capricorn. In this divine expression of ray energy is to be found the key or clue to what
is commonly called evolution. The emphasis, is necessarily from the angle
of the form nature and upon the phenomenal side. Today, however, the
evolutionary process can be considered from the two aspects of the
evolution of form and the evolution of consciousness; science and
psychology contribute to this a gradually developing whole or picture. But
that which I deal with here is the evolution of That which is both
consciousness and form but which is more than either, i.e. the One Who
wills to manifest and to know or to become aware. It is this which lies
behind and which is greater than the Identity in time and space to which we
give the name Logos. I seek to deal, therefore, with the Creative Will which
is dynamically manifesting, consciously establishing contact and
persistently focussed in the form whilst time and space endure.
[629] This third aspect of the divine expression is the result or outcome of
the activity of the other two major rays. You must, with care, distinguish in
your minds between matter or the Mother and substance or the “Holy Spirit
overshadowing the Mother”; it is with this latter we are concerned, for we
are regarding all these rays in terms of will, of spirit, and of life. This whole
treatise, therefore, deals with an idea which lies beyond or behind the entire
content of modern knowledge and is consequently inexplicable to the finite mind. All that is possible is to indicate That which exists prior to
manifestation and which persists after the cycle of manifestation is over—
unprovable, unknowable and intangible. This inherent Reality is to the
manifested Logos what the sensed, immortal Self is to the man in
incarnation. As the abstract mind of man develops, these subjective themes,
leading to the central Theme of manifestation, will become clearer and the
density of the mystery will lighten. With this promise you must be content
for you are not yet initiate. The initiate will sense whereof I speak.
This evolving Reality which is focussed in the third Ray of Active
Intelligence during the “period of appearance” has—in this solar system—
undertaken the task of developing conscious “awareness of Itself in that
which it is not.” This is carried forward in three stages—all of them the
result of process, of progress, of activity and of mind or intelligent
perception. These three stages are:
1. The stage wherein sensory perception is transmuted into knowledge.
This is the stage in which the form gradually and steadily adapts itself
to the requirements of the perceiving Self.
2. The stage wherein knowledge is transmuted into wisdom, [630] or
consciousness utilises the gradually acquired knowledge to achieve
detachment from the form, the organ of perception.
3. The stage wherein wisdom is transmuted into omniscience and both
consciousness and form are superseded by the One Who exists, Who
is conscious, but Who remains as greater than either of these two
phases of divine life. This One wills to incarnate, wills to know, wills
to be conscious, but is none of these phases essentially, having
realised them, prior to manifestation.
This third ray will is the producer of external synthesis in successive stages,
carried forward from temporary syntheses until there is complete unification
between consciousness and form and later complete atonement realised
between That which is neither consciousness nor form but the Creator of
both and the relating Principle of spirit-matter. It will be seen how the above
definition shows the function of the third ray to be the will-to-initiate on the physical plane that which will express divinity; that it defines not only
appearance but the revelation of that quality of which the appearance is the
effect or result, and that inherent in these two propositions lies the third
which states that this creative will is not only the cause of manifestation and
the guarantee of achievement, but is also the proof of the potency of that
Life which ever defeats and annihilates death. So, we come back to our
initial proposition of that divine trinity of Life-Quality-Appearance
(considered in the opening pages of Volume I); thus also to the creativity of
the three major rays; thus to their basic relation and thus to their enduring
and persistent synthesis. The circle of revelation is rounded out; the cycle is
completed; the serpent of matter, the serpent of wisdom and the serpent of
life are seen to be one [631] whole and behind the three “stands the Eternal
Dragon for ever spawning forth the triple serpent, for ever saying: Go forth
and come thou back.” Thus speaks the Old Commentary in reference to this
matter.
Three words are concerned with this triple manifestation: Attraction,
Subtraction, Abstraction and these three are related (as far as man is
concerned) to the first three initiations, but only from the will aspect and in
relation definitely to the third ray upon the physical plane, or rather on the
plane of the etheric body or the vital effective activity. It is this which must
be borne in mind when considering the active work of the Trinity: Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.
This Trinity in manifestation knows Itself as the Transcending Reality and
utters ever the word: “Having pervaded this whole universe with a fragment
of Myself, I remain.”
This Trinity in manifestation knows Itself as the Transmitting One and says
through the words of the Christ: “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto
Me.” This, through the attractive power which the Transmitting One
transmits.
This Trinity in manifestation knows Itself to be the Transforming Agent and
through the voice of the many chants the words: “Glory to God in the highest, on Earth peace, goodwill to men”—glory, peace and the will-togood being the effects of the transmitted life of the Transcendent One.
Finally, at the end of the age, it knows Itself as the Transfigured One and
realises that the paean of the angels: “Glory to God in the highest” is the
enunciation of its ultimate perfection and triumph.
Can more be said anent this subject? The major Rays of Aspect embody the
entire story; the minor Rays of Attribute contribute the detail in process and
enterprise. They [632] are conditioned by the three major rays. It is not,
therefore, my intention to take up the analysis of the four remaining
triangles. I have indicated enough in this treatise to enable the interested
student to work out for himself their subjective theme. I will, however,
consider briefly the three constellations connected with the third ray; their
significance is relatively clear.
1. CANCER . This is the constellation which symbolises the will of the
mass, which conditions mass response and mass psychology. This has not
yet been the theme of astrological study for it connotes far more than the
mass consciousness. It is basically the focussing of the mass will through
the medium of the mass consciousness—a thing unknown as yet, though the
rudiments of this knowledge can be seen in that peculiar factor in the life of
humanity which we call ‘public opinion.’ This is now being brought into the
educational field through what is commonly called propaganda. The
implications will be clear to you. A trained and enlightened public opinion
is an unknown thing on a world-wide scale, though enlightened groups are
rapidly appearing. Out of public opinion (which is the focussed expression
of the growth of mass consciousness) will emerge the mass will-to-good,
inherent in every individual; for this humanity must work and wait.
2. LIBRA . This constellation, as you know, connotes the point of balance in
the long relationship and interplay between the pairs of opposites. It
indicates the will-to-express—in perfected proportion and harmony—both
the life of the spirit and the potency of matter. 3. CAPRICORN . This constellation stands for the influence which will
carry the will of Shamballa to the Hierarchy or to the world initiates, giving
to Them that dynamic and [633] enterprising spirit which will enable Them
to carry forward to completion the Will of God on Earth. It was the “angel,
born under Capricorn” which came to Christ in the garden of Gethsemane
and fused His individual will into the divine Will and thus enabled Him to
carry out His mission to completion. This was not only the revelation of
divine love to the world but—as the legend in the Masters’ Archives goes
on—He came “to fabricate the gossamer thread which bound the two
together and linked the place of the Most High (Shamballa) with the Holy
City (The Hierarchy). The bridge between the Holy Place and the Holy of
Holies was securely anchored. The will of God could now be carried to
fruition.” Under the same symbolic teaching, we could say that the
following terms distinguish the three rays with which we have been dealing.
I. Ray I. Gêmeos . Ray Gêmeos . III. Ray III. The Holy of Holies. Shamballa.
The Dwelling Place of the Most High.
Spirit. Life. Energy.
Will. Identification.
The Holy Place. Hierarchy.
The Secret Place where Light dwelleth.
Soul. Consciousness. Light.
Love. Initiation.
The Outer Court. Humanity.
Christ in us, the hope of glory.
Form. Appearance. Body.
Intelligence. Individuality. Remember, nevertheless, that these Three are One. Behind all of them
stands for ever the One Who remains, transcendent [634] and immanent
also, greater than our whole yet also within that whole.
Through Ray IV, we learn to be at-one with this eternal synthesis and will;
through Ray V, we develop the means to understand the nature of that
synthesis and will; through Ray VI, we move forward to complete
identification with that synthesis and will, and through Ray VII we demonstrate on Earth the nature of that synthesis through the medium of the
appearing form and the purpose of that underlying will.
And so the Many are absorbed into the One. APPENDIX - Suggestions for Students
ASTROLOGY IN THE SECRET DOCTRINE
(Third Edition)
[635] 1. Mythology relates to astronomical, theogonical and human
struggles; to the adjustment of orbs and the supremacy of nations and tribes.
The “struggle for existence” and the “survival of the fittest” reigned
supreme from the moment that Kosmos manifested into being.... Hence:
a. The incessant fights of the Gods in all the Old Scriptures.
b. The war in Heaven of the ancient mythologies. (S.D. I. 223.)
2. Behind this veil ... of astrological symbols, there were the occult
mysteries of anthropography and the primeval genesis of man. (S.D. I. 250.)
3. Astrology existed before astronomy. (S.D. III. 325.) Júpiter . Astrolatry or the adoration of the Heavenly Host is the natural result of
only half-revealed astrology.... Hence, divine Astrology for the Initiates;
superstitious astrolatry for the profane. (S.D. III. 337.)
5. Primitive astrology is as far above modern astrology as the Guides (the
planets and the Zodiacal signs) are above the lamp posts. (S.D. III. 341.)
[636]
6. Astrology has left its eternal imprint upon the world. (S.D. III. 342.)
7. Astrology is built upon the mystic and intimate connection between the
heavenly bodies and mankind and is one of the great secrets of Initiation and
the occult mysteries. (S.D. Gêmeos . 525.)
8. Stars and constellations have an occult and mysterious influence on, and
connection with, individuals. And if with the latter, why not with nations,
races and mankind as a whole? This again is a claim made on the authority
of the Zodiacal records. (S.D. I. 709.)
a. There are records preserved through the Zodiac for incalculable ages.
(S.D. I. 709.) b. Astronomy, astrology and so on are all on the physical and not on the
spiritual plane. (S.D. Gêmeos . 667.)
c. Those philosophers alone who studied astrology ... knew that the last
word of those sciences was to be sought in and expected from the
occult forces emanating from the constellations. (S.D. III. 214.) Mercúrio . “... In the presence of the Eternal conformity of the divisions of the
Zodiac and of the names of the Planets applied in the same order
everywhere and always and in the presence of the impossibility of
attributing it all to chance and coincidence ... a very great antiquity indeed
must be allowed for the Zodiac. (S.D. I. 711.)
10. High ceremonial astrology ... depends upon the knowledge of the
Initiate of those immaterial Forces and spiritual Entities that affect matter
and guide it. (S.D. III. 337.)
11. “... our Earth was created or fashioned by terrestrial [637] spirits, the
Regents (the Spirits of the seven planets. A.A.B.) being simply the
supervisors. This is the first germ of that which grew later into the Tree of
Astrology and Astrolatry.” (S.D. Gêmeos . 26.)
12. “There are seven chief groups of such Dhyan Chohans. They are the
primeval seven Rays.... Hence there are seven chief planets, the spheres of
the indwelling seven Spirits, under each of which is born one of the human
groups.” (S.D. I. 626.)
13. “There are only seven planets specially connected with the Earth and
twelve houses, but the possible combination of their aspects are countless.
As each planet can stand to each of the others in twelve different aspects
their combinations must be almost infinite.” (S.D. I. 626.)
14. That which is the surviving Entity in us is partly the direct emanation
from and partly those celestial entities themselves. (S.D. I. 251.)
15. The descent and reascent of the monad or soul cannot be disconnected
from Zodiacal signs.... (S.D. I. 730.)
16. The following five statements are basic— 1. Each of the Primordial Seven, the first seven rays, forming the
manifesting logos, is again sevenfold.
2. As the seven colours of the solar spectrum correspond to the seven
rays or Hierarchies so each of these is sub-divided into seven.
3. Each of these Hierarchies furnishes the essence (the soul) and is the
builder of one of the seven kingdoms in nature—the three elemental
kingdoms, the mineral, vegetable, animal and kingdom of spiritual
man. [638] Júpiter . Each Hierarchy furnishes the aura of one of the seven principles in
man with its specific colour.
5. Each of these Hierarchies is the ruler of one of the sacred planets.
Thus astrology came into existence and has a strictly scientific basis. (S.D.
III. 482.)
17. All the great astrologers have admitted that man could react against the
stars. (S.D. III. 339.)
18. This system (or cycles) cannot be comprehended if the spiritual action of
these periods—pre-ordained so to say by karmic law—is separated from
their physical course. The calculations of the best astrologers would fail, or
at any rate remain imperfect, unless this dual action is thoroughly taken into
consideration and mastered upon these lines. This mastery can be achieved
only through initiation. (S.D. I. 703.)
19. Modern astrologers do not give the correspondences of the days and
planets and colours correctly.
20. There is white and black astrology ... the good or bad results obtained do
not depend upon the principles which are the same in both kinds, but upon
the astrologer himself. (S.D. III. 339.)
NOTE: S.D. I, Section XVI and S.D. III, Section XXXVIII deal with the
Zodiac, with Biblical references to the Zodiac and with astrology and the
mysteries of Initiation.
THE CONSTELLATIONS 1. “Each of the twelve constellations, whether separately or in combination
with other signs, has an occult influence, either for good or evil.” (S.D. I.
440.) [639]
2. “Enoch, the type of the dual nature of man (spiritual and physical)
occupies the centre of the astronomic Cross ... which is a six-pointed star....
In the upper angle of the upper triangle is the Eagle (Scorpio); in the left
lower angle stands the Lion (Leo); in the right, the Bull (Taurus); while
between the Bull and the Lion ... is the face of Enoch, the man (Aquarius)....
These are the four animals of Ezekiel and Revelations.” (S.D. Gêmeos . 561, 562.)
(The Fixed Cross of the Heavens)
3. “The constellations of the Great Bear and of the Pleiades constitute the
greatest mystery of occult nature.” (S.D. Gêmeos . 580.) Júpiter . “From the beginning of humanity, the Cross, or Man, with arms stretched
out horizontally (the Fixed Cross) typifying his cosmic origin, was
connected with his psychic nature and with the struggles which led to
initiation.” (S.D. III. 141.)
NOTE: All the travels of all the Heroes of antiquity through the signs of the
sun and the heavens ... are in each individual case, the personification of the
sufferings, triumphs, and miracles of an adept before and after initiation.
5. The signs of the zodiac: Each a double sign in ancient astrological magic
—namely: it was Taurus-Eve; and Scorpio was Mars-Lupa, or Mars with the
female wolf.... So as these signs were opposites of each other, yet met in the
centre they are connected; ... (S.D. III. 154.)
References in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire .
[640] 6. “Until the mystery of the Great Bear is revealed and is known as it
is, and until the influence of Pleiades is comprehended, and the true
significance of the cosmic Triangle formed by
1. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear,
2. The seven planetary Logoi of our solar system,
3. The seven Pleiades or Sisters, is revealed, the karma of the seven sacred planets will remain unknown. All
that we can see is its working out in the solar system. The intricacy of the
whole subject will be apparent when it is borne in mind that not only do
these three groups form a cosmic triangle, but that within that triangle many
lesser triangles have to be studied. Any one of the seven Rishis with one of
the seven Sisters may form a subsidiary triangle, and all must thus be
studied.” (C.F. 801.)
7. “A further factor in cyclic computation lies in the effect of the following
stars and constellations upon our system and upon any particular planet
within the system:
1.
2.
3. The Great Bear.
The little Bear.
(Ursa Minor)
The Pole Star. Júpiter . The Pleiades.
5. Constellation Capricorn.
6. Draco. And all the other constellations and allied stars of the zodiac. The mystery is
hidden in esoteric astrology and until the subject of energy, working through
the etheric body, of radio-activity and of the transmutation of all bodies
from a lower state into a higher is better comprehended, the true mystery of
the “influence of [641] these various bodies upon each other will remain at
its present stage—an unrevealed secret.” (C.F. 795.)
8. Energy in the universe can be differentiated as follows:
“1. Inter-cosmic—affecting constellations.
2. Inter-planetary—affecting planets.
3. Inter-chain—affecting the chains in a planetary cycle. Júpiter . Inter-globular—producing interchange of force between the globes of
a chain.
5. Inter-sectional—affecting the transference of force between the
kingdoms in nature.
6. Inter-human—interplay between men.
7. Inter-atomic—passage of force between atoms.” (C.F. 1029.) Mercúrio . “There must also be borne in mind the play of energy which emanates
from any one of the twelve constellations or signs of the zodiac, with which
astrology concerns itself. This type of force is primarily concerned with
planetary stimulation, with the planetary Logoi, and is hidden in Their
cyclic karma—a karma which will incidentally involve those monads and
devas which form Their bodies and centres.” (C.F. 1052.)
10. “These three groups of solar bodies (The Great Bear, the Pleiades and
Sirius) are of paramount influence where the spiral cyclic activity of our
system is concerned. Just as in the human atom, the spiral activity is egoic
and controlled from the egoic body, so in connection with the solar system
these three groups are related to the Logoic Spiritual Triad—atma-buddhimanas—and their influence is dominant in connection with solar
incarnation, with solar evolution and with solar progress.” (C.F. 1058.)
[642]
THE PLANETS
1. “There are seven chief planets, the spheres of the indwelling seven
Spirits. These seven Spirits are:
a. The seven chief groups of Dhyan Chohans.
b. The seven Primeval Rays.” (S.D. I. 626.)
2. “There are only seven planets specially connected with the Earth, and
twelve houses, but the possible combinations of their aspects are
countless.... Each planet can stand to each of the other in twelve different
aspects.” (S.D. I. 626.)
3. “The names of the Planets are applied in the same order everywhere and
always.” (S.D. I. 711.) Júpiter . “The Seven Planetary Regents (Planetary Logoi) are `the Seven Sons of
Sophia (Wisdom)’.” (S.D. Gêmeos . 221. Note.)
5. “For Pythagoras the forces were Spiritual Entities, Gods, independent of
planets and Matter as we see and know them on Earth, who are the rulers of
the Sidereal Heaven.” (S.D. I. 535.) 6. “The seven Sons of Light—called after their planets and often even
identified with them—namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Venus and
presumably the Sun and the Moon.” (S.D. I. 628.)
7. “The planets have their growth, changes, development and gradual
evolution.” (S.D. I. 667.)
8. “Plato represented the planets as moved by an intrinsic Rector ... one with
his dwelling, like a `boatman in his boat’.” (S.D. I. 535.)
a. “The planets were not inanimate masses but acting and living bodies.”
b. “The planets were rational intelligences circulating around the sun.”
(S.D. I. 535.) [643] Mercúrio . “The seven planets have for supreme Spirits, Fortune and Destiny, who
uphold the eternal stability of the laws of Nature throughout incessant
transformation and perpetual agitation. The ether is the instrument or
medium by which all is produced.” (S.D. I. 735.)
10. “The seven Gods were divided into two triads and the sun.
a. Lower Triad—Mars, Mercury and Venus.
b. Higher Triad—Moon, Jupiter and Saturn.
(the Moon standing for a hidden planet.) (S.D. Gêmeos . 484, 5.)
11. “Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are the four exoteric planets and
three others which must remain nameless (Pluto and the two hidden planets.
A.A.B.) were the heavenly bodies in direct astral and psychic
communication—morally and physically—with the Earth, its Guides and
Watchers. The visible orbs furnish our humanity with its outward and
inward characteristics and their Regents or Rectors with our Monads and
spiritual faculties.” (S.D. I. 628.)
12. “The Trinity was represented by the Sun (the Father), Mercury (the
Son), and Venus (the Holy Spirit).” (S.D. Gêmeos . 569.)
13. “There were seven tabernacles ready to be inhabited by Monads under
seven different karmic conditions.” (S.D. Gêmeos . 223.) 14. “Every race in its evolution is said to be born under the influence of one
of the planets.” (S.D. Gêmeos . 27.)
15. “The Tradition of the 70 planets that preside over the destiny of nations
is based on the occult cosmogonical teaching that besides our own systemic
chain of World [644] Planets there are many more in the solar system.”
(S.D. I. 718, note.)
16. “The spirit of the planet is as much a creator in his own realm as the
Spirit of the heavens (i.e. the form life and the soul life of the planet.
A.A.B.).” (S.D. Gêmeos . 500.)
17. “The seven planets are the Sun’s brothers and not his sons.” (S.D. I.
483.)
18. “The Planetary Spirits, are the informing spirits of the stars in general
and of the planet especially. They rule the destinies of men who are all born
under one or other of their constellations.” (S.D. I. 153.)
19. “Each of the planets (of which seven only are called sacred because
ruled by the highest Regents or Gods) ... is a septenary”.... (S.D. I. 176.)
20. The following tabulation is suggestive:
a. God the Father—1st Logos—Electric Fire. Great Bear. Sun.
b. God the Son—2nd Logos—Solar Fire—Sirius. Venus and Mercury.
c. God the Holy Spirit—3rd Logos—Fire by friction—Pleiades. Saturn
(C.F. 96.)
21. “The planetary Spirit is another term for the Logos of a planet, Who is
one of the “seven Spirits before the Throne of God” and therefore one of the
seven Heavenly Men. He is on the evolutionary arc of the Universe and has
passed many stages beyond the human. The planetary Entity is on the
involutionary arc and is a very low grade entity. He is the sum total of all the
elemental lives of the planet.” (C.F. 105, note.)
22. “The seven sacred Planets are composed of matter of [645] the fourth
ether and the planetary Logoi (the seven Heavenly Men) whose bodies the planets are, function normally on the fourth plane of the system, the buddhic
plane.” (C.F. 121.)
23. “Certain of the planets are to the Logos what the permanent atoms are to
man. They embody principles. Certain planets afford only temporary homes
to these principles. This is one of the distinctions between a sacred and a
non-sacred planet.” (C.F. 299.)
24. “Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Vulcan are still developing the mind
principle.” (C.F. 403.)
25. “Those who are working in the Uranus, the Neptune and the Saturn
scheme work somewhat differently to those functioning in the Venus, the
Vulcan, the Mars, the Mercury, the Jupiter, the Earth and the exoteric Saturn
scheme, and so do the Manasadevas (the solar Angels) of the inner round.
We should note here that we again have a triplicity of groups, representing a
triplicity of forces and herein lies a hint. In the others, the higher group and
the middle group hold sway as these planets are the most occult and sacred
in manifestation, and are concerned with egos who are on the Path, and who
are therefore group-active. In connection with Uranus, Neptune and Saturn,
this might be expected as they are the synthesising planetary schemes, and
provide conditions suitable only for the very advanced stages. They are
called the ‘reaping’ planets.” (C.F. 777.)
26. “Mercury and Venus, the Sun and the Moon constitute the ‘Guardian
angels of the four corners of the Earth’.”[646]
NOTE:
a. (The sun and moon veil hidden planets).
b. These are the four Maharajahs, connected with karma, humanity,
cosmos and man.
c. They are the Sun or its substitute—Michael.
They are the Moon or its substitute—Gabriel.
They are Mercury or its substitute—Raphael.
They are Venus or its substitute—Uriel. (S.D. III. 459.) 27. “Saturn—governs the devotional faculties.
Mercury—governs the intellectual faculties.
Jupiter—governs the sympathetic faculties.
The Sun—governs the governing faculties.
Mars—governs the selfish faculties.
Venus—governs the tenacious faculties.
Moon—governs the instinctual faculties.” (S.D. III. 463.)
28. “The seven Angels Who preside over the seven planets are the Builders
of the Universe. They are the natural Guardians of the seven regions of our
planetary system.” (S.D. III. 115.)
29. “The seven Builders graft the divine and the beneficent forces on to the
gross material nature of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms every Second
Round.” (S.D. III. 162; Note, I.)
30. “The seven planetary Spirits or Angels ... are identical with the Dhyan
Chohans of the esoteric doctrine and have been transformed into the
archangels and the Spirits of the Presence by the Christian Church.” (S.D.
III. 160.)
31. “The seven chief Deities ... are the rays of the One Boundless Unity.”
(S.D. III. 229.) [647]
32. “Each of the seven chambers of the Pyramid was known by the name of
one of the planets.” (S.D. III. 247.)
33. “The Kabiri were always the seven planets ... who together with their
Father, the Sun ... composed a powerful ogdoad.” (S.D. III. 316.)
34. “The Ancients knew of seven planets besides the sun.... The seventh
with two others were mystery planets.” (S.D. III. 316. Note.)
35. “The solar system is (from the higher cosmic planes), seen as a vast blue
lotus and so on down the scale; even the tiny atom of substance can be so
considered.... The solar system is a twelve-petalled lotus, each petal being
formed of forty-nine lesser petals. The planetary lotuses differ in each scheme and one of the secrets of initiation is revealed when the number of
petals of:
a. Our earth planet
b. Our planetary polar opposite
c. Our complementary equilibrising planet
is committed to the initiate.” (C.F. 1018.).
36. “Within the Hall of Wisdom, there exists a department of which the
modern astrological organisations are dim and uncertain reflections. The
Adepts connected with it work not with humanity but concern Themselves
specifically with “casting the horoscopes” of the various great lives who
inform ... the kingdoms of nature, with ascertaining the nature of the karmic
influences working out in the manifestation of the three planetary Logoi
(mentioned under point 35 above).... They progress these various
horoscopes [648] for the next stated cycle and Their records are of profound
interest. I would conjure students to refrain from attempting to form cyclic
computations of any kind for as yet the many constellations which exist
only in physical matter of an etheric nature are unknown and unseen. Yet
they are potent in influence and until etheric vision is developed, all
calculations will be full of error.” (C.F. 1057.)
37. “A planetary Logos is the meeting place for two types of force, spiritual
or logoic, which reaches Him ... from the seven Rishis of the Great Bear on
Their own plane, and, secondly, of buddhic force which is transmitted via
the seven Sisters or the Pleiades from a constellation called The Dragon and
from which has come the appellation ‘The Dragon of Wisdom’.” (C.F.
1162.)

being aligned in a peculiar fashion with certain spheres (or planets) on
the inner round a dual opportunity exists for humanity which
facilitates, whilst it complicates, the evolutionary process. The sacred
planets are called often the ‘seven grades of psychic knowledge’ or
the ‘seven divisions of the field of knowledge’.” (C.F. 1175.)

Synthesising these five—The Sun THE RAYS AND THE PLANETS
[651] Each of the seven sacred planets (of which our Earth is not one) is an
expression of one of the seven ray influences. These seven planets may be
enumerated as follows, and the rays working through them are accurately
given. The student, however, must remember three things:
1. That every planet is the incarnation of a Life, or an Entity or Being.
2. That every planet, like a human being, is the expression of two ray
forces—the personality and the egoic.
3. That two rays are therefore in esoteric conflict in each planet.
It should also be noted that until the mystery of the constellation of the
Great Bear is revealed, and until the influence of the Pleiades is
comprehended and the true significance of the cosmic triangle formed by:
a. The seven Rishis of the Great Bear.
b. The seven Planetary Logoi of our solar system.
c. The seven Pleiades or Sisters.
is also revealed, the destiny and true function of the seven sacred planets
will remain unknown. Within this cosmic triangle are many lesser ones. Any
one of the seven Rishis with one of our planetary Logoi and one of the
seven Sisters can form subsidiary triangles and the combinations possible
are many and intricate.
NOTE: In the occult books there are many enumerations of the planets
and many of these are simply blinds and the sacred and non-sacred
planets are deliberately intermixed. In the Tibetan’s books there are
several such enumerations, i.e., the two listed above and the
following: [652]
The Seven Planets, Centres or Schemes
1. Vulcan—the sun exoterically considered.
2. Venus.
3. Mars. Júpiter . The Earth. 5. Mercury.
6. Saturn.
7. Jupiter.

1. Uranus—8.
2. Neptune— Mercúrio .
3. Saturn.

The Sun.
The first one given above will be regarded as accurate for this world period
and will be the basis of our astrological teaching. The informing Lives of
the seven sacred planets are called by the following names:
1. The seven Planetary Logoi.
2. The seven Spirits before the throne.
3. The seven Kumaras. Júpiter . The seven solar Deities.
5. The primordial Seven.
6. The seven Builders.
7. The seven intellectual Breaths.
8. The seven Manus. Mercúrio . The Flames.
10. Lords of Love, Knowledge and Sacrifice.

of cosmic evil.... When the heavenly triangle is duly equilibrated and the

Pleiad involved and the planetary [657] scheme concerned, then cosmic evil will be negated and a relative perfection achieved.” (Cosmic Fire,
990.)

VENUS
In the second solar system, and in connection with the method employed
therein, another point merits attention. This fire of mind has its source in a
constellation until recently unrecognised by exoteric science as having any
relation of an intimate nature to our solar system, owing to its tremendous
distance away. The sun “Sirius” is the source of logoic manas in the same
sense as the Pleiades are connected with the evolution of manas in the seven
Heavenly Men, and Venus was responsible for the coming in of mind in the
Earth chain. Each was primary to the other, or was the agent which
produced the first flicker of consciousness in the particular groups involved.
In every case the method was that of a slow evolutionary growth till the
consciousness suddenly blazed forth owing to the interposition of force,
apparently from an extraneous source. [680]
1. “The Logos.—Solar System. Sirius.
2. Seven Heavenly Men—Planetary scheme. Pleiades. 3. Heavenly Man—earth chain. Venus.”
(Cosmic Fire, page 347.)
The Fourth Kingdom and the Hierarchy of the Planet
“Certain facts have already been grasped and realised by the average occult
student who has been pondering this teaching with care. He is aware that the
juncture of Spirit-matter and mind, or manas, was effected during the third
root-race, and that the definitely human family became present upon earth
from that date. He knows that this was brought about by the coming, in
bodily Presence, of certain great Entities, and he has learned that these
Entities came from the Venusian chain, that They achieved the necessary
juncture, undertook the government of the planet, founded the occult
Hierarchy, and that—though some remain with the chain—the remainder
have returned to Their originating source. This in many ways sums up the
totality of the present knowledge. Let us briefly enlarge upon it, correct
certain erroneous interpretations, and ascertain one or two new facts. We
might tabulate these as follows:
First, it should be borne in mind by the occult student that:
a. This advent signalised the taking of a physical vehicle by the planetary
Logos, and was literally the coming of the Avatar.
b. This advent was brought about by a definite systemic alignment which
involved:
The Venus scheme of the system.
The Venus chain of the Earth scheme.
The Venus globe of the Earth chain. [681]
c. That the planetary Logos did not come from the Venus scheme but
from the Venus chain of His own scheme, the Earth scheme. Owing to
systemic alignment logoic kundalini could flow through a certain
triangle of which two points were Venus and the Earth. This caused
an acceleration of vibration, and enabled the Heavenly Man of our
scheme to take a minor initiation, and to set about His preparations
for a major initiation. Next, it should also be remembered that in considering this matter we must
be careful to view it not only as it affects our own globe and its present
humanity, but from the systemic and cosmic point of view, or from the angle
of its importance to a planetary Logos and a solar Logos. Hence it is a fact
that this event was not only the result of the taking of a minor initiation by
our Earth Logos, but in the Venus scheme was signalised by the taking of a
major initiation by the Venusian planetary Logos on His fifth chain. In
connection with a solar Logos it followed upon the stimulation of one of His
centres and from the geometrical progression of the fire through the earlier
mentioned Triangle.
It has been stated that one hundred and four Kumaras came from Venus to
the Earth; literally the figure was one hundred and five, when the
synthesising Unit, the Lord of the World Himself, is counted as one. There
remain still with Him the three Buddhas of Activity. I would call attention to
the dual significance of that name, “Buddha of Activity,” bearing out, as it
does, the reality of the fact that Entities at Their stage of evolution are active
love-wisdom and embody in Themselves the two aspects. The three
Buddhas of Activity have a correspondence to the three persons of the
Trinity.” (C.F. 386-7.)
[682] “The planetary Logos of this scheme is called ‘the First Kumara,’ the
One Initiator, and the statement is made that he came to this planet from
Venus, Venus being ‘the Earth’s primary.’ This needs elucidation somewhat,
though it may not be permitted to do more than convey a few hints as to the
truth. The fact is one of the most mysterious in the development of our
scheme, and in it lies hidden the secret of this world cycle. It is not easy to
convey the truth and words but seem to veil and cloak.
Perhaps a hint may be given in pointing out that there is an analogy between
the coming in of the Ego in full sway and its taking hold at certain periods
in the life of a human being. At seven years we are told the Ego “takes
hold,” and again at adolescence; at twenty-one that hold may be made still
firmer. Again, as lives are passed, the Ego (in connection with a human
being), grips its vehicles and so sways them to his purpose with more effect and fullness. The same procedure can be seen in relation to a Heavenly Man
and His body of manifestation, a scheme. It must be remembered that every
scheme has seven chains; that each chain has seven globes, making a totality
of forty-nine globes; that each globe is again in turn occupied by the life of
the Logos during what we call seven rounds, making literally three hundred
and forty-three incarnations, or fresh impulses to manifest. We must add to
these major manifestations such lesser ones as those named by us root-races,
and sub-races, also branch races, and thus we are faced with a complexity
that is enough to stagger the average student. The planetary wheel of life
turns on its lesser scale the wheel of life of the little pilgrim we call man; as
it turns, it sweeps the life of the evolving planetary Logos into ever new
forms and experiences until the fire of Spirit burns up all lesser fires.
[683] As earlier pointed out, each Heavenly Man is linked with one of His
Brothers under the Law of Mutual Attraction, which manifests so
degradingly as yet upon the physical plane, through the life of the human
unit, imprisoned in physical form. Psychically the link is of a different
nature, and such a link is found between the planetary Logos of the scheme
we call Venus, and the Logos of our scheme. This psychic interaction has its
cyclic ebb and flow, as ebbs and flows all life force. In Lemurian days came
a period of close interaction which brought about an incarnation on the
physical planet of the Logos of our scheme, the Head of the Hierarchy, and
the One Initiator. This could not have been effected had not the planetary
Logos of the Venus scheme been in a position to link up closely with ours.”
(C.F. 366-7.)
“The Cosmos . Our solar system, with the Pleiades and one of the stars of
the Great Bear, form a cosmic triangle, or an aggregation of three centres in
the Body of Him of Whom naught may be said . The seven stars in the
constellation of the Great Bear are the correspondences to the seven head
centres in the body of that Being, greater than our Logos. Again, two other
systems, when allied with the solar system and the Pleiades, make a lower
quaternary which are eventually synthesised into the seven head centres in much the same way as in the human being after the fourth initiation.” (C.F.
182.)
“A clue tending towards the correct understanding lies hid in the words:
‘Venus is the Earth’s primary.’
It is not permissible to say much about this mystery, that ‘Venus is the
Earth’s alter ego,’ nor is it advisable, but certain ideas may be suggested
which—if brooded on—may result in a wider grasp of the beauty of nature’s
[684] synthesis, and of the wonderful correlation of all that is in process of
evolution.
Perhaps some idea may be gained if we remember that, in an occult sense,
Venus is to the Earth what the higher Self is to man.
The coming of the Lords of Flame to the Earth was all under law and not
just an accidental and fortunate happening; it was a planetary matter which
finds its correspondence in the connection between the mental unit and the
manasic permanent atom. Again, as the antahkarana is built by individual
man between these two points, so—again in a planetary sense—is a channel
being built by collective man on this planet to its primary, Venus.
In connection with these two planets, it must be remembered that Venus is a
sacred planet and the Earth is not. This means that certain of the planets are
to the Logos what the permanent atoms are to man. They embody
principles. Certain planets afford only temporary homes to these principles.
Others persist throughout the mahamanvantara. Of these Venus is one.”
(C.F. 298.)
“It would be well to enlarge here a little on the connection between Venus
and the Earth, which is hinted at in some of the occult books, and is
somewhat touched upon in this. I have stated that the interaction between
the two schemes is due largely to their positive and negative polarity, and I
pointed out that a similar relation underlies the relation of the Pleiades and
the seven schemes of our solar system, and also the relation of Sirius and
the system itself. This, therefore, sweeps into close interaction three great
systems: 1. The system of Sirius. [685]
2. The system of the Pleiades.
3. The system of which our sun is the focal point.
making, as we will have noted, a cosmic triangle. Within our system there
are several such triangles, varying at different stages; according to their
relation to each other, the differentiated force of the different schemes can
pass from scheme to scheme, and thus the units of life on the different rays
or streams of force become temporarily intermingled. In all these triangles
(cosmic, systemic, planetary, and human) two points of the triangle
represent each a different polarity, and one point represents the point of
equilibrium, or synthesis or merging. This should be borne in mind in
studying both the macrocosmic and microcosmic centres, for it accounts for
diversity in manifestation, in forms and in quality.
A correspondence might here also be pointed out which may serve to
convey light to those who have eyes to see:
The Venus scheme, being in the fifth round, had the fifth principle of manas
coordinated and developed, the minor four manasic aspects had been
synthesised, and the buddhic aspect was being provided with a means of
expression through the medium of the perfected fifth. Our Heavenly Man, in
the fifth round, will have attained a paralleling point in evolution, and the
fifth principle will, as stated, be no longer the object of His attention as
regards the human units.” (C.F. 375-6.)
Just as Venus is negatively polarised to our Earth scheme, so the seven stars
of the Pleiades are negatively polarised to our seven schemes.
A very pertinent question might here be asked. We might justly enquire (in
connection with the point that Venus is negatively polarised, and also that
the Pleiades [686] are equally so) why they should be termed negative if
they are the donors and not the receivers, for to be negative is surely to be
receptive. This is indeed so, but the question arises in our minds, owing to
lack of information, and consequent misapprehension. Venus may have had
much to do with the impartation of the stimulation which resulted in great events on Earth via the Venus chain of our scheme, but our scheme gave, in
a mysterious manner, more than was received , though the gift was not of
the same nature. The coming in of the Venusian influence to our chain, and
to our planet, with the subsequent stimulation of certain groups in the fourth
Creative Hierarchy, the human, caused a paralleling event of even greater
magnitude in the Venus scheme. This affected the sixth Hierarchy, one of
the deva Hierarchies, dwelling in the Venus scheme. This stimulation
emanated via our sixth chain (or the second according to the angle of vision)
and affected the corresponding chain in the Venus scheme. The magnitude
of the difference may be seen in the fact that in our case one globe alone
was affected, whereas the influence of our scheme on the Venusian was such
that an entire chain was stimulated. This was brought about through the
positive polarity of the Heavenly Man of the Earth scheme.” (C.F. 377-8.)
“The statement that the great Kumara or the One Initiator came to this
planet from Venus is true in so far as it embodies the fact that He came to
this dense planet (the fourth) in the fourth chain from that chain in our
scheme which is called the ‘Venus’ chain, and which is the second chain. He
came via the second globe in our chain; His scarcely felt vibration was
sensed (occultly) in the second round, but only in the third root-race of the
fourth round did conditions permit of His physical incarnation and of [687]
His coming as the Avatar. Very reverently might it he said that the first three
rounds and the two succeeding root-races in this chain correspond to the
period prior to birth; and that His coming in the fourth round with the
subsequent awakening of manas in the human units find their analogy in the
awakening of the life principle in the unborn infant at the fourth month.”
(C.F. 371.)
SOME HINTS ON THE SCIENCE OF TRIANGLES
“Two hints can here he given for thoughtful consideration. In connection
with one of the Heavenly Men (which one cannot at this juncture be pointed
out) we have one triangle of force to be seen in the following three centres:
a. The force centre of which the Manu, and His group, are the
expression. b. The centre of which the Bodhisattva or the Christ and His adherents
are the focal point.
c. The centre of which the Mahachohan and his followers are the
exponents.
These three groups form the three centres in one great triangle—a triangle
which is not yet in complete vivification at this stage of evolutionary
development.
Another triangle in connection with our own planetary Logos is that formed
by the seven Kumaras—the four exoteric Kumaras corresponding to the
four minor head centres, and the three esoteric Kumaras corresponding to
the three major head centres.
The second hint I seek to give, lies in the triangle formed by the Earth,
Mars and Mercury. In connection [688] with this triangle, the analogy lies
in the fact that Mercury and the centre at the base of the spine in the human
being are closely allied. Mercury demonstrates kundalini in intelligent
activity, while Mars demonstrates kundalini latent. The truth lies hid in their
two astrological symbols. In transmutation and planetary geometrising, the
secret may be revealed.”
“... Just as in connection with our planetary Logos, the three etheric planets
of our chain—Earth, Mercury and Mars—form a triangle of rare
importance, so it may be here said that at the present point in evolution of
the logoic centres, Venus, Earth and Saturn form one triangle of great
interest. It is a triangle that is at this time undergoing vivification through
the action of kundalini; it is consequently increasing the vibratory capacity
of the centres, which are becoming slowly fourth-dimensional. It is not yet
permissible to point out others of the great triangles....” (Cosmic Fire, p.
180-2.)
“There is a definite occult reason, under the Laws of Electricity, behind the
known fact that every initiate, presented to the Initiator, is accompanied by
two of the Masters, who stand one on either side of him. The three of them together form a triangle which makes the work possible.” (Cosmic Fire, p.
210.)
“... In all these triangles (cosmic, systemic, planetary, and human) two
points of the triangle represent each a different polarity, and one point
represents the point of equilibrium, of synthesis or merging.” (Cosmic Fire,
p. 375.)
[689] “Another fact that should be noted about these great Beings is, that
when viewed in Their seven groups, They form:
a. Focal points for the force or influence emanating from the other solar
centres or schemes.
b. The seven divisions of the occult Hierarchy.
They exist, as does the Heavenly Man Himself, in etheric matter, and are
literally great Wheels, or centres of living Fire, manasic and electric fire;
They vitalise the body of the Heavenly Man and hold all together as an
objective whole. They make a planetary triangle within the chain, and each
of Them vitalises one globe.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 388.)
1. “Two connecting principles are needed. This requires a living spiritual
Fire of the middle principle from the fifth and third states of Pleroma. This
fire is the possession of the Triangles.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 681.)
“Second , just as in the case of man, certain triangles of force are found at
different stages of evolution, or (to word it otherwise) different centres
become geometrically linked, such as the:
a. Base of the spine,
b. Solar plexus,
c. Heart;
or again,
a. Solar Plexus,
b. Heart,
c. Throat; [690] so, in the case of a Heavenly Man, or of a solar Logos, a similar event
occurs. Such an event transpired in this round in relation to the centre which our planetary Logos embodies. It became geometrically linked with two
other centres, of which Venus was one, and logoic Kundalini—circulating
with tremendous force through this adjusted Triangle—brought about that
intensification of vibration in the human family which resulted in
individualisation.” (Cosmic Fire, pp. 368- Mercúrio .)
“A hint may here be given to those who have power to see. Three
constellations are connected with the fifth logoic principle in its threefold
manifestation; Sirius, two of the Pleiades, and a small constellation whose
name must be ascertained by the intuition of the student. These three govern
the appropriation by the Logos of His dense body. When the last pralaya
ended, and the etheric body had been coordinated, a triangle in the Heavens
was formed under law which permitted a flow of force, producing vibration
on the fifth systemic plane. That triangle still persists, and is the cause of the
continued inflow of manasic force; it is connected with the spirillae in the
logoic mental unit and as long as His will-to-be persists, the energy will
continue to flow through. In the fifth round, it will be felt at its height.”
(Cosmic Fire, p. 699.)
“The heart of the Sun, and its relation to the lower and higher mental
bodies, producing that peculiar manifestation we call the causal
body. In this connection it must be remembered that the force
which flows from the heart of the Sun, works through a triangle
formed by the Venusian scheme, the Earth and the Sun.
[691] “That another triangle was also formed involving two planets
was to be expected under the law, and the triangles vary according
to the scheme involved.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 664.)
“We must recognise another triangle within the Earth scheme, of the chains
called “the Earth chain,” the Venus chain, and the Mercurian chain, but this
triangle entirely concerns the centres of the planetary Logos of our scheme.
A systemic formation of great importance in the next round should be
pointed out which will bring three schemes:
The Earth Scheme,
Mars, Mercury,
into such a position in relation to each other that the following results will
eventuate:
A systemic triangle will be formed .” (Cosmic Fire, p. 390.)
“Three of the sacred planets, it should be remembered, are the home of the
three major Rays, the embodied forms of the three logoic aspects or
principles. Other planets are embodiments of the four minor rays. We might
consider—from the standpoint of the present—that Venus, Jupiter and
Saturn might be considered as the vehicles of the three super-principles at
this time. Mercury, the Earth and Mars are closely allied to these three, but a
hidden mystery lies here. The evolution of the inner round has a close
connection with this problem. Perhaps some light may be thrown upon the
obscurity of the matter by the realisation that just as the Logos has (in the
non-sacred planets) the [692] correspondence to the permanent atoms in the
human being, so the middle evolution between these two (God and man) is
the Heavenly Man, whose body is made up of human and deva monads, and
Who has likewise His permanent atoms. Always the three higher principles
can be distinguished in importance from the four lower.” (Cosmic Fire, p.
299.)
“Those who are working in the Uranus, the Neptune, and the Saturn scheme
work somewhat differently to those functioning in the Venus, the Vulcan,
the Mars, the Mercury, the Jupiter, the Earth and the exoteric Saturn scheme,
and so do the Manasadevas of the inner round. We should note here that we
again have a triplicity of groups, representing a triplicity of force, and herein
lies a hint. In the central list of schemes the middle and lower group of
Agnishvattas are active. In the others the higher group and middle group
hold sway as these planets are the most occult and sacred in manifestation,
and are concerned only with egos who are on the Path, and who are
therefore group-active. In connection with Uranus, Neptune and Saturn, this
might be expected as they are the synthesising planetary schemes, and provide conditions suitable only for the very advanced stages. They are the
‘reaping’ planets.” (Cosmic Fire, p. 777.)
“The planets Venus and Jupiter are exceedingly closely connected
with the Earth, and form eventually an esoteric triangle.”
(Cosmic Fire, p. 370.)
“Each of the planets—of which seven only were called sacred—
whether known or unknown, is a septenary , as is also the chain
to which the Earth belongs....” (S.D. I. 176.)

PLANETS, RAYS AND ESOTERIC TEACHING
Uranus (7th)—The School of Magic of the tenth order. It is sometimes
called ‘the planet of the violet force,’ and its graduates wield the power of
cosmic etheric prana.
Earth (3rd)—The School of Magnetic Response . Another name given to its
pupils is ‘The graduates of painful endeavour’ or the ‘adjudicators between
the polar opposites.’ Its graduates are said to undergo examination upon the
3rd subplane of the astral plane.
Vulcan (1st)—The School of Fiery Stones. There is a curious connection
between the human units who pass through its halls and the mineral
kingdom. The human units on the earth scheme are called ‘the living
stones’; on the Vulcan they are called ‘fiery stones.’
[694] Jupiter (2nd)—The School of Beneficent Magicians . This planet is
sometimes called in the parlance of the Schools, the ‘College of Quadruple Force Units,’ for its members wield four kinds of force in constructive
magical work. Another name given to its halls is ‘The Palace of Opulence’
for its graduates work with the law of Supply and are frequently called the
‘sowers.’
Mercury (4th)—The pupils of this planetary school are called ‘The Sons of
Aspiration’ or ‘The points of Yellow Light.’ They have a close connection
with our Earth scheme. The name of this school is not given.
Venus (5th)—The School with five strict Grades . This again is a planetary
scheme closely related to ours. Its planetary Logos is in a more advanced
group of cosmic students than is ours. Most of its hierarchical instructors
come from the 5th cosmic plane.
Mars (6th)—The School for Warriors , or the open grades for soldiers. Four
